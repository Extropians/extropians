Ok.  My contention is that the insights of people like Socrates, Plato and especially Aristotle helped shaped the entire western point of view.  Have we really exceeded it?  Most people I know refuse to see outside of the box that Western thinking defines itself as.  I believe that if were not for some incredibly brilliant modern brains like Reimann, Godel, Einstien, Hiesenberg, Schrodinger, Feynman, etc., we might still be stuck in that box.

My contention is that since a very large amount of manuscripts were lost it is possible there might have been other thinkers equal or greater in intelligence and insigt than Aristotle. Imagine the possibilities!

Yes, but the unfortuante side of that coin, is much of this computerized knowledge is also being lost in many ways.  Much of the computer data stored on Magnetic Tape, 8 and 12 inch floppies is already lost.  CD ROM's supposedly only hold their data integretiy for a decade or so.  Perhaps optical crystal holographic storage is the answer?

(Sorry if I flamed earlier, when I write at work my style tends to be more antagonsitic due to my current set of work associates.)

I agree it is very benificial to look forward, to see things with entirely new perspective and insights.  Afterall, isn't that what evolution is always about, exploring new avenues of pontential and possibility?  Yet, previous knowledge is just as useful.  It can help guide you to places that no else has been.  Perhaps the ancients have already traveled down back alleys that terminated in dead ends.  Would it be wise to ignorantly repeat their folly?  Not to be trite, but "know history so as not to repeat it".

BTW, their is a guy on public radio, usually on Monday evenings, buy the name of Clay Jenkinson.  He *is* Thomas Jefferson in nearly every respect.  He is a Jeffersonian scholar with Ph.d's in History and literature.  This guy knows so much about Jefferson and how he thinks, that he becomes Jefferson for the entire hour of his show.  From that vantage he answers any question posed to him by the call-in audience.  His answers and the perspective he provides are deeply refreshing and powerful.  I believe if Jefferson were alive today and in a powerful position in Washington, he would be making very positive and lasting effects on American society.  Perhaps we would not be currently enduring the tryannical assault on our liberties currently going on in the name of safety and the Drug War.

Also, don't forget to take massive amounts of vitamin C whenever cancer strikes.
This means at least 6 grams a day and up (rule of thumb: your intestines will let
you know when you've reached your absorbtion limit). "Healthy" people should take at
least 3 grams a day, or again as much 
as your intestines can take (an "overdose" will give you the runs, but is otherwise
harmless). For various reasons it is better to use a combination 
of calcium ascorbate, magnesium ascorbate and vitamin C tablets with bioflavonoids
instead of (just) ascorbic acid & sodium ascorbate.

I recently posted here (ExI's "LawNode" mail list) an inquiry concerning the 
Mars Society and its "Law and Governance Task Force".  I received one 
private, off-list reply that proved to be quite prophetic in characterizing 
the Mars Society as being essentially a "Kim Stanley Robinson fan club", with 
all that that implies about a statist willingness to engage in authoritarian 
social engineering.  I posted a neutral inquiry to the Mars Society list a 
week or so ago, asking about general attitudes there regarding central 
planetary-scale control, and the role of the state in the kinds of Martian 
settlement envisioned there.  Not surprisingly, the focus of the discussion 
was the "Martian Constitution" featured in the Robinson novels.  The 
following is a post I sent to the Mars Society law and governance list this 
morning:

                                                 * * *

Rather than responding in detail to each of the interesting posts regarding a 
possible Martian constitution (a task that would take all day, I'm afraid), 
I'll offer my observations here in thematic terms.

First, the physical circumstances under which Martian political entities 
would be formed will obviously strongly influence their character.  Will 
colonies be heavily dependant on Earth for resupply, or will they be largely 
able to support themselves?  Will Mars offer resources to Earth that will be 
considered strategically important to Terran governments?  How easy will 
immigration be in physical terms?  Will Martian political entities be created 
in a technological milieu that creates a significant economic surplus, or 
will colonists at that time be largely concerned with simple physical 
survival and will they consist largely only of the technicians necessary to 
support life at Mars?  And will early Martians be traditional humans at all, 
or will colonization only become a reality at a time when the human animal is 
subject to more or less complete biological reengineering?

The importance of each of these factors separately and all of them together 
should be obvious.  To look at just a few of these factors, consider that a 
Martian constitution formed by a small group of highly educated, largely 
technically- and scientifically-oriented people (perhaps made up in 
significant part by people with a military background) (i.e. the sort of 
people who currently characterize humanity's cadre of spacefarers), 
significantly dependant on a constant and expensive channel of resupply from 
Earth, would be very different from one formed by a larger, more diverse 
group of humans whose technology liberates them from economic dependance on 
Earth.

Consider that humans have maintained an outpost in Antarctica for three 
generations now but, except for relatively minor questions of local 
governance, have made no attempt to establish any sort of unique or 
independent cultural and political identity.  Contrast this with various 
groups of European colonists in the New World in a previous era: Able to 
support themselves and having reached a critical level of cultural breadth 
and self-sufficiency, they asserted independence and expressed a new 
synthesis of the elements of their cultural heritage.

I believe the bare physical circumstances of establishing a human presence at 
Mars provide limiting values for some of these parameters.  I am a space 
enthusiast (see: http://users.aol.com/gburch1/space.html) and a near-extreme 
techno-optimist (see: http://users.aol.com/gburch2/scnrio1.html and 
http://users.aol.com/gburch3/thext.html), but I try to also be a realist.  
Even if the most clever plans of the Mars Underground are realized, human 
presence at Mars will be a very limited and tenuous proposition with current 
and next-generation technologies.  Employing technologies I see as likely 
through 2020-2050, human outposts at Mars will be just that; scientific 
research installations very much like ones we now find at Antarctica.  There 
will only be two types of people at such installations: Scientists and 
technicians to support the scientists.  They will be employed nearly 100% of 
their time with the task of learning about Mars and staying alive, and they 
will be nearly completely dependant on costly resupply from Earth for crucial 
support for their survival.

To the extent that there will be a political element to the lives of these 
first-generation Martians, it will likely be more akin to the politics of a 
scientific institution or a high-tech military base than of a general 
parliament.  The first Martians will be more concerned with grant money than 
taxation and issues relating to plumbing supplies will probably predominate 
over questions of general human rights.  The cut-throat competition within 
academia and stereotypes of testosterone overload notwithstanding, PhDs and 
test pilots tend to be among the portion of the human population least in 
need of rules of governance, because they are self-selected and 
institutionally sifted for intelligence, cooperativeness and critical 
rationality.  Far more than the "First Hundred" will be further filtered in a 
way that ensures that few true political problems will arise at Mars that 
will require a real constitution.  

(A personal aside: I've known a few graduates of the U.S. Navy's nuclear 
submarine corp, both officers and enlisted men.  A more intelligent, 
well-educated, rational and cooperative lot it would literally be impossible 
to find, IMHO, because of the unique screening process to which they are 
subjected.  I believe they probably provide a good example of the kind of 
people we'll see in the "First Thousand").

All of this having been said, I do believe quite firmly that there will be a 
"population explosion" of immigration to Mars, perhaps as early as the first 
part of the second half of the 21st Century.  This will only be possible, 
however, once the technology for comfortable and secure self-sufficiency has 
been developed.  In my mind there is one key to this technology, the kind of 
advanced molecular nanotechnology (MNT) envisioned by Eric Drexler in his 
books "Engines of Creation" and "Nanosystems" (see: http://www.foresight.org, 
a citation I'm sure I need not offer to this list). 

This opinion leads to the conclusion that we will not see a steady curve of 
socio-economic factors underlying Martian settlement.  Early scientific 
exploration by humans in situ will be just barely possible with the most 
clever engineering before MNT, and significant emigration to Mars and other 
extraterrestrial points will be relatively inexpensive once a "mature MNT" is 
developed.  This is a very different profile than was presented by the 
technological milieu of 16th-18th century technology and the settlement of 
the New World, where there were no significant discontinuities of settlement 
between the first explorers and the formation of new and independent 
polities.  In the historical experience, a slow, steady improvement of 
technology and growth of global trading infrastructure supported a steady 
stream of immigration to the New World and a fairly continuous development of 
colonial economic and cultural self-sufficiency and independence.

These points lead to some conclusions for me about the physical parameters 
that will influence the formation of the first real Martian (and other 
extraterrestrial) polities.  The first "government" at Mars will be extremely 
local and will concern the minutiae of life in small, isolated scientific and 
military  installations.  I imagine that the kind of ad-hoc democratic 
behavior characteristic of well-educated, rational modern people will 
generate a host of small "institutions" for the governance of things like 
duty rosters, assignment to hazardous activities and the consumption of rare 
and expensive "luxuries" like open living space and the occasional leisure 
activity of amateur entertainments and like.  To the extent that larger 
political and legal issues may arise, they will almost certainly be dealt 
with as such matters are dealt with now in similar circumstances, through a 
case-by-case application of "home country" laws and institutions.  (See, for 
instance how "flag" law is applied to ships at sea, a general military code 
of justice is applied in foreign military installations and general "home 
country" law is applied in offshore oil installations).  To the extent that 
minor property rights issues or the unlikely and exceedingly rare criminal 
issue might arise, the early scientific settlers would almost surely look to 
a case-by-case application of the laws of their home countries -- almost 
certainly through the mechanism of courts and governing bodies on earth.  (As 
much as I'd like to think that I could get an early ride on the strength of 
offering my legal services, I believe I'm more likely to represent an early 
Martian settler via telepresence, something I already do with my 
international clientele.)

A very different situation will be presented by the settlement of Mars with 
advanced molecular nanotechnology and a mature genetic science.  From a 
society characterized by tiny, isolated scientific installations, tens of 
thousands and then millions of people might descend on Mars, but with the 
technology to be independent from Earth and each other, except in terms of 
information.  I see this discontinuity as being not only possible but highly 
probable for reasons of simple economics: Before MNT, it will cost a lot to 
get to Mars and stay there and the only return on the investment will be 
scientific knowledge.  Mars is, by definition, at the bottom of a gravity 
well far from Earth.  The only reason to go there is to be there.  This will 
be true after a "nanotech revolution", with the only difference being the 
cost and ease of getting there and staying there.  So who will go to Mars 
after the development of MNT?  Two kinds of people: Tourists and "ideological 
settlers", people who want to leave Earth and start a new life for strong 
personal and philosophical reasons.

So I conclude that any real, distinct "Martian constitution" will almost 
certainly be formed in the physical circumstances of a recent overwhelming 
technological revolution and by people who move to Mars for two very 
different sets of reasons and ones not typical of the motivations of average 
citizens of Earth today: On the one hand (1) commerce in the form of (a) 
operators of resorts and "high-tech wilderness travel" businesses and (b) 
settler-oriented business (land speculation and development and 
infrastructure supply) and, on the other hand, (2) ideology in the form of 
(a) settlers intent on forming communities with specific ideological and 
philosophical identities and (b) high-tech hermits.

Now, what sort of polities might grow out of such physical circumstances?  
Let me first say that I have a lot of respect for Kim Stanley Robinson and 
his three books, especially for the depth of knowledge about Mars evidenced 
there.  But I have a fairly harsh judgment of the "futurology" upon which the 
books are based and the political ideas and projections that one finds in the 
story line.  I share the idea that there will be a sudden, large wave of 
settlement of extremely diverse types of people and that the greatest 
conflicts will center around terraforming.  However, as I try to explain 
above, the physical circumstances of the settlement of Mars will be very, 
very different from what Robinson projects.  IMHO, there is a near-zero 
probability that significant numbers of people could ever find themselves at 
Mars without the physical wherewithal to be self-sufficient and independent.  
Accordingly, given the wide disparity of motivations for emigration we will 
likely see, environmental issues seem to be essentially the only ones that 
would require any kind of planetary-scale governance.  Unless the early 
settlers in a post-nanotech era make the mistake of creating government for 
its own sake (which creates a group of people whose product is legislation), 
there will be no ECONOMIC constituency favoring planetary governance for any 
purpose other than regulating the planetary environment.

Some of the ideological settlers will very likely have a planetary-scale 
utopian vision they would seek to impose on all immigrants.  But there will 
likely be multiple such global ideologies, and just as many, if not more, of 
the ideological settlers will hold values antithetical to any kind of broad 
universal social construct.  In such a circumstance, it seems most probable 
that a minarchist polity would develop whose primary function would be to 
oppose any sort of attempt to establish a global social order.  Thus I see 
the most probable planetary constitution to be one which only prohibits 
inter-group use of force and establishes and maintains whatever global 
environmental consensus might be reached.  Given the economic independence 
possible with a mature molecular nanotechnology, I see very little chance 
that the diverse groups that will descend on Mars will accept anything more 
elaborate as a planetary government.

Having said all of this, I agree with Robinson that the knottiest problem 
will be questions arising from terraforming.  I find it unlikely that purist 
"Reds" will dominate the consensus that might be reached.  Only aerologists 
and the most extreme "wilderness aesthetes" would hold such a position and 
they will be in a tiny minority.  The vast majority of settlers will be 
fairly avid technophiles and adventurers, the kinds of people who are willing 
to "tinker with nature".  (The discovery of indigenous active life forms 
might influence this factor somewhat, though it seems unlikely that it would 
forestall significant terraforming for long.)

Given the diversity of settler motivations, it seems probable that diverse 
approaches to terraforming would likely develop, with multiple engineered 
ecologies growing outward from different settlements. This would give rise to 
challenges of social order the like of which we have never seen before and 
which might make the conflicts between ranchers and farmers in the settlement 
of the American West seem tame.  I will end this very long post by offering 
my own general view of how I think such conflicts would be best resolved.  
Given the complexity and unforeseeability of the development of a new and 
artificial planetary ecology, I think it is unlikely that a centralized 
planning bureau for terraforming could manage the process any better than an 
ad-hoc, "bottom-up" approach of multilateral spontaneous ordering.  In this 
respect, I commend Virginia Postrel's recent book, "The Future and Its 
Enemies" (see:http://www.extropy.org/eo/articles/gbcurrent.html and 
http://www.dynamist.com) as a view of how "local knowledge" and spontaneous 
social orders can provide satisfactory solutions to complex problems -- even 
ones as complex as managing the terraforming of Mars.

Does anyone on the list have experience with
taking Bovine Colostrum?

Or knowledge as to its pros/cons?

How does it compare with HGH (Human Growth Hormone)?

It comes as a spray-dried concentrate.  I have been blending it into
some experimental nutracuticals I have in development.  I have been
largely using it for the IGg content as well as other immunoglobulins.
I feel there is basis in research to support increasing the
"knowledge base" of our immune ecology  and bovine colostrum can
be part of the strategy to accomplish this.

Or the disvocery of a carved wooden glider which uses an aerofoil,
vertical stabilizer, and the idea of dihedral for stability. All in an
Egyptian tomb....

Mohammed II used a screw gun type cannon with a 36" bore to take
Constantinople...and his descendants were still using the same guns in
the 18th century to bombard British ships trying to run through the
Dardanelles without paying the tolls...

The important part of discovering lost info like that is it value to
archaologists in developing a more thorough knowledge of who knew what
when and how.

We should push ahead as much as possible. Fears of the passing of the
human race are IMHO rather premature and naive. You forget that even
today, there are humans living a near stone age existence, and we have
not exterminated the other ape species either.

The Alexandrian Library
The Great Library of Alexandria, so called to distinguish it from the 
smaller or "daughter" library in the Serapeum, was a foundation of the first 
Ptolemies for the purpose of aiding the maintenance of Greek civilization in 
the midst of the conservative Egyptians. If the removal of Demetrius 
Phalereus to Alexandria, in 296-295 B.C., was connected with the 
organization of the library, at least the plan for this institution must 
have been formed under Ptolemaios Soter (died c. 284 B.C.), but the 
completion of the work and its connection with the Museum was achievement of 
his successor, Ptolemaios Philadelphos. As Strabo does not mention the 
library in his description of the buildings upon the harbour, it is clear 
that it was not in that part of the city, and its connection with the Museum 
points to a location in the Brucheion, or northwestern quarter of the city.

Of the means by which the books were acquired many anecdotes are told. Ships 
entering the harbour were forced to give up any manuscripts they had on 
board and take copies instead. The official copy of the works of the three 
great tragedians belonging to Athens was retained by forfeiting the deposit 
of 15 talents that had been pledged for its return. The rivalry between 
Alexandria and Pergamon was so keen that to cripple the latter the 
exportation of papyrus was prohibited. Necessity led to the perfecting of 
the methods of preparing skins to receive writing, the improved material 
being known as " charta pergamena ", from which is derived our " parchment". 
This rivalry was also the occasion of the composition of many spurious 
works, of devices for giving to manuscripts a false appearance of antiquity, 
and also of hasty and careless copying.

The number of books thus obtained is variously stated, the discrepancy being 
due partly to the fact that the statements refer to various periods. 
Demetrius Phalereus is said to have reported that the number of papyrus 
rolls was 200,000, but that he hoped to increase it soon to 500,000. In the 
time of Callimachos 490,000 rolls are mentioned; later, Aulus Gellius and 
Ammianus Marcellinus speak of 700,000 rolls. Orosius, on the other hand, 
speaks only of 400,000, while Seneca says that 40,000 rolls were burnt 
(probably an error for 400,000).

The first librarian was Zenodotus (234 B.C.). He was succeeded in turn by 
Eratosthenes (234-195 B.C.); Aristophanes of Byzantium (195-181 B.C.); and 
Aristarchos of Samothrace (181-171 B.C.), all famous names in the history of 
scholarship. The inclusion in this list of Callimachos and Apollonios 
Rhodios rests on slight authority and seems chronologically impossible. The 
work of these men consisted in classifying, cataloguing, and editing the 
works of Greek literature and exerted a deep and permanent influence not 
only upon the form of the books, their subdivisions, and arrangement, but 
also upon the transmission of the texts and all phases of the study of the 
history of literature.

After Aristarchos the importance of the library began to wane. In 47 B.C. 
Caesar was compelled to set fire to his fleet to prevent its falling into 
the hands of the Egyptians. The fire spread to the docks and the naval 
arsenal, and destroyed 400,000 rolls. It is most probable from the statement 
of Orosius that these were not in the library itself, but had been removed 
from it preparatory for shipment to Rome, a view confirmed by the statement 
of the author of the "Bellum Alexandrinum " that Alexandria was built in 
such a way as to be safe from a great conflagration. Seneca and Gellius also 
speak only of the burning of manuscripts, though the latter represents the 
destruction as complete. Less carefully, Plutarch and Dio Cassius speak of 
the burning of the library, but had this been the case we should find 
mention of it in Cicero and Strabo.

The loss of books was partly repaired by Anthony 's gift to Cleopatra, in 41 
B.C., of 200,000 volumes from the library of Pergamon. Domitian drew upon 
the library for transcripts. Under Aurelian, in A.D. 272, the greater part 
of the Brucheion was destroyed, and it is most probable that the library 
perished at this time. The small library in the Serapeum is supposed to have 
perished when the temple of Serapis was destroyed by Theophilus, but there 
is no definite statement to that effect. Up to the time of Gibbon, the 
generally accepted version of the destruction of the library was that, on 
the capture of the city by the Mahommedans in A.D. 642, John Philoponos, 
having formed a friendship with their general Amrou, asked for the gift of 
the library. Amrou referred the matter to the Caliph Omar and received the 
answer:

If these writings of the Greeks agree with the book of God, they are 
useless, and need not be preserved; if they disagree, they are pernicious, 
and ought to be destroyed.
Accordingly, they were employed in the baths as fuel, and lasted six months. 
This story is now generally discredited, chiefly because it rests only on 
the authority of Abulpharagius, a writer six centuries later, while earlier 
writers, especially Eutychius and Elmacin, make no mention of it. Besides, 
the act is contrary to Mohammedan custom; John Philoponos lived about a 
century before the capture of the city, and the statement of the time the 
rolls lasted as fuel is preposterous. Finally, there is the evidence given 
above for the earlier destruction of the library.

THE Internet is great.  It was designed, with its peer-to-peer network, with
military tolerance for any breakdown.  Its open access to the dissemination of
information is the greatest public library, billboard, and church door in
history.

The biggest threat to the entirety of regular Internet WWW functionality is DNS,
in terms of global connectivity, although any size of DNS names might be cached
anywhere.

For all works in the Library of Congress to be transcribed into digital form and
made available on the Internet would be a wonderful thing, and would do much to
expand the breadth of human knowledge, and I might even term it a just use of
tax dollars.  To be sure, there are copyright issues involved, but any number of
uncopyrighted works or those whose copyrights had expired could be put online.
If one can go to a library and check out a copyrighted work for free, why not
over the Internet?  It will certainly enhance inter-library loan when more
material is available for electronic request and delivery.

Besides space debris, data overload and overflow is a very large problem.  There
is very much.  Early indexes of the net, for example, the Yahoo! server on
akebono, had wise notions of categorizing and cataloging large numbers of
Internet documents, and turned it into companies very high price-to-earnings
ratios.

Besides everything on paper, there is a huge amount of data on crumbling
magnetic tapes.  The federal archives do tend to preserve that which is
important, but much data that might not seem so today is lost.

Such a catastrophe as befell the great Western store of accumulated knowledge
more than 2,000 years ago could not very well occur today, unless the face of
the planet was razed.

The Internet is great.  I use it to research every day.  If there was an
Internet when I was young, I would have spent much time on it.  As it is, it
grows every day, like kudzu.

Here's to the Library of Alexandria, and the Great Internet.

Actually the postal service has many large denomination stamps.
These are useful for mailing parcels and also for international air
mail, as well as perhaps making some extra income from collectors.

http://www.stampsonline.com/collect/stamp97/mars.jpg is a three dollar
stamp showing the Mars Pathfinder.

It would have been neat to have the Rand stamp be $1.00 but this way it
is more useful and even non-collectors can justify buying it.

Terry: The correct figure is $55. Even if you select the membership option

I'm confused by what you mean by this statement.

Do you mean that the existence of those populations, even after all the
transformations that have taken place so far under the Reign of Modern Man,
implies that any future transfomations will also be by necessity incomplete
or reversible?

Or did you mean that those still existing primative humans and apes are a
sort of "backup" in case we manage to destroy our civilization, or even our
entire race, by some accident of (nano)technology?

Neither of these would seem particularly rational beliefs, given the nigh
omnipotent reach and power of the technologies we are discussing, nor of
our previous track record. I would just point out that most
anthropaleontolgists would agree that the current fossil record implies
that many hominid and primate species may have been supplanted and
extincted by genus homo - before we ever had anything better than sharp
sticks and stones. [And we are pretty much close enough to causing the
extinction as will soon make no difference to the Mountain Gorillas. The
Orangutangs and the Bonobos aren't doing so hot under the Reign of Modern
Man either.]

I think it is clear that even at our current level of technology, we are
capable of wasting/destroying all primate life on the planet. Caution, when
entering the age of a potentially more powerful technology than any we have
discovered before, would seem to be the rational and wise choice.

Hope someone didn't already post this, but here goes.

May-June 1999's _American Scientist_ has a review of 
Michael Ray Taylor's _Dark Life: Martian Nanobacteria,
Rock-Eating Cave Bugs, and Other Extreme Organisms
of Inner Earth and Outer Space_ (Scriber: 1999).  The
book looks to be too popular level for me, but it is good
to see another addition to the literature on nanobacteria.
Hopefully, it'll spark more interest in the subject.

And from that might come another path to creating MNT --
i.e., via reengineering nanobacteria.

Cheers!

The entire DNS database is updated regularly on every web server at
every ISP, so there is not threat to its being destroyed. Thats why they
are called name servers. When you request a page from a site, your ISP's
webserver looks up the DNS and its corresponding IP address, then
queries the network for the data from that IP address. The routers take
that query and send it to the next closer router, etc. The system does
not query network solutions' registry every time.

Use tax dollars to pay for the wholesale ripoff of millions of people's
copyright rights? I don't think so. It will have to be a pay as you go
system, with micropayments for each use of copyrighted material.

As long as storage media technologies continue to expand, and the speed
of the processors processing the search index requests continue to grow,
there will be no problem with overload and overflow. Developing filters
for properly analysing lare amounts of data is a growth industry and
shows no sign of abating.

Most information on tapes is raw data, lists of names, numbers, etc.
Magnetic tapes, stored properly, do not crumble or otherwise degrade
easily. I am still using 9 track magnetic tapes that are older than I am
on a regular basis for list processing operations.

On the contrary, several dozen high altitude, high flux nukes would EMP
out much of our accumulated knowledge, which is why most government
repositories are now built underground.

Not to simply be contrarian, but one simple DNS bug can be seen to make DNS across
large sectors of the Internet dependent on Network Solution's root nameserver break.

I note specifically the availability of large quantities of uncopyrighted materials.
These public domain materials warehoused in the interests of the public domain would
be better if they were available to larger sectors of the public electronically.

In terms of a digital lending library, what's the difference between lending a
hard-copy book and an electronic representation of same?  Again, I say this partially
to be contrarian, I'm not a librarian, and I do recognize copyright values and the
rights to same, such as personal data copyrights.

If there was a way to ensure that a digital representation wasn't copied, for example
a "black box" container and viewer, there would be little or no difference between
lending a hard-copy and a digital copy, except that it would be possble to borrow a
copy from a library far away much easier, and that such benefits as are provided by
conventional libraries would be more widely available.

You are more or less absolutely correct, except for the paper libraries.  The
development of movable type four or five hundred years ago did lead to a large
quantity of bound and printed dead trees.

Why don't you just mark all your property yourself?  Copyright is most
useful when you want to tell someone *else* what they can and 
cannot do with their own printer or CD-R burner.  I have no problem
with copyright by contract, but I don't think it would be enforceable.

Oh yeah, and here we are again - information only for those whoe are able to
pay. I do not want do be considered Socialist - my mother comes for Eastern
Europe and I had the chnace to wittness the spirit of a Communist
Dictatorship myself - but Information is something which should not be kept
this way. Your copyright is kept by not allowing anyone to falsify it, but
it should be available freely - anywhere. You know, lack of information and
communication is one of the main causes of poverty. Manhattan has more
telephones than the entire African continent. Most of Africa is still in the
stone age, mainly because there are a whole lot of people who do not want a
change to this. You want it to remain this way?

But to keep you capitalists happy: The state might pay you some bucks if the
information you provide is interesting enough so that the public interest is
served with the publication of the information in question.

Think logical, we'll have to get away from this capitalist way of using
information. We need the synergy effects of the mass availability of
information, when and wherever it is needed. The non-availability of
information is in fact a typical trait of any hierarchy. Information means
power. If you control the flow of information, you control all people who
get the information (or not). This is not keyed to a 1984-style
dictatorship, it works with any form of government, up to and including a
democracy.

Take for example the american war of 1863. Haven't you been taught that it
was fought to free the slaves? I was told this, too. But no country ever
fought a war out of humanitarian ideas. That war was fought because the
North would not tolerate the decision of the South to make an independant
state. It was an economic war, the industrial north against the agricultural
south. The same is true for the second world war. You wouldn't want to tell
me the US entered the war because of the fate of the Jews? Or that Britain
and France entered the war because of the fate of Poland? Bullshit. It was
simply a question of distribution of power.
Much the same is true for Zaire/Congo. The old dictator - Mobutu - was a
French puppet, the new monkey dictator - Kabila - is remote-controlled by
the US. Of course, a democratic state would never do such evil things. Of
course, humanitarian ideals are held very high within a state who respects
the human rights and the politics are streamlined accordingly. Of course no
politician gives a penny for these empty words. As long as they keep this
information for themselves and no one gets really involved, this works fine.

Wrongo, BASF conducted a test which concluded, that even under ideal storage
circumstances, 100% reliability is guaranteed only five years. Your 9-track
magnetic tapes still work because they store a huge stream of analog data.
Your ears have a built-in noise-reduction which screens out most of the bad
audio data that comes in. But gradually, the quality of these recordings
will fade. In adio recordings, the quality simply gets worse. In data tapes,
it gets lost, because eventually, the errors destroy too many bits of data,
making an error correction impossible. Much more with the high-packed data
tapes of today.

I visited a large picture library some years ago and was surprised to see
that most of the color photos were transferred to black-and-white
diapositive films. This is simply because over the time, the colours
eventually fade and change. If you look at a photo from the early sixties,
you'll notice some strange colour defects. After all, the chemical process
doesn't stop whne the picture leaves the lab. Today, this practice hasn't
changed - only that the pictures are stored in digital form too, this time
in colour.

Since copyright is simply state recognition that ideas that are original and originate with me belong to me (a Natural Right as per the 9th Amendment), while taxes are a right delegated to the state by the people, all tax law must comply with the letter and spirit of that delegation. Income tax is not a constitutional delegation of that power, which is why it is explicitly a voluntary system which the government forces people to volunteer through the widespread use of the Social Security and Nationalized Banking systems. Apples and Oranges.

You can do whatever you want with your CD burner, so long as it is not infringing on my rights to my information. Its as simple as me having the right to do whatever I want with my guns, so long as I am not shooting you with them for no reason. Simple delineation of property lines.

Moreover, you can mark your property yourself as a copyright. You no longer have to register a copyright with the government. The registration is simply a matter of establishing a more formally accepted origination date. You can copyright your information, and I can copyright my information. If we originated the same information separately with nobody influencing the other, then we both have the same right to that information. This is where what is called the 'poor man's copyright' comes in, where you mail yourself a copy of the information, so it is post dated, but you don't open it. This establishes your origination date. Essentially if your information is published, a year later it is assumed to be sufficiently disseminated in the public that you have exclusive right to that information. If someone originates their own identical information within that period, then there is shared rights to that information.

For example, an architect I know designed a building, and it was built (and he retained a copyright on the design). A photo of this building made it into an industry mag, where another architect on the other side of the country noticed that the building was almost an exact duplicate of one of his designs (in appearance). He sued, but since no 'germination' evidence could be established, and both men designed their buildings at about the same time, they both had a right to the design.

That's a trademark, not a copyright.  Trademarks are just like
real property in that they are genuinely scarce, and have value
in their scarcity.  It is not possible for two people to use
the same name without interference.  Indeed, they are economic
"diamond goods", whose only value /is/ their scarcity, so it
is theoretically possible that government could pay for itself
by being the central registry of names and have no negative
effects on the economy--I'm surprised this hasn't been brought
up more often.

Copyright is different--by claiming a copyright to a piece of
information, the government is aiding you in enforcing a monopoly
on /all copies/ of that information produced by anyone--even
those that can be used by many people without interference.  My
use of a book does not interfere with yours or anyone's.  If I
make copies of it, I do not diminish anyone else's use, but I do
compete with the author's market.  Our government has decided
that protecting the market for authors and inventors is worth
granting this monopoly--that is certainly arguable, because we
do not generally protect markets in other things.

Each DNS at each ISP holds a minuscule share of the entire database, most
definitely not the entire database.  It can cache requests that go through
it but that only for a short time (usually one hour) and only of the
request done on it. A DNS usually only holds the IP table for whatever
domains it is acting as a master or as a secondary for, and usually you
only have two servers knowing the IPs for a subdomain.  Whatever ISP you
are using does not have a clue what IP corresponds to
s335984.student.uq.edu.au but the root servers know who the dns master for
edu.au is (munnari.oz.au), who still doesn't know the ip but it knows that
the master dns for uq.edu.au is krefti.uq.edu.au, and so on.  This system
enables each dns to respond quickly to name lookups since they only have
to hold a couple of name to ip matchings but it does mean that it is
fragile.  If the 7 or 8 root servers were taken down all cross domain
lookups (eg from .edu to .com, or from .gov to .uk) would fail after the
corresponding caches expire (1 to 3 hours).

Extropians and Cryonauts,

	I've been enjoying the NBC miniseries about Noah that started
last night.  I think this Noah story could become a powerful tool in
the promotion of cryonics and extropy and would like to see cryonic
people talk about this story more.  (Hey, could we contract a toy
company to make some toy dewers and characters that fit inside? ;)

	Towards this end I'm reposting hear an article of mine John de
Rivaz published in his "Longevity Report".

========================================================================

	Everyone's familiar with the Noah story right?  The one where
Noah tries to warn everyone about the impending, yet avoidable doom,
trying to get everyone to help build arks so that they might survive
the flood.  But, unfortunately, no one listens to him, (for what
reasons?) and he and his family, along with the animals he has
collected, are the only ones that survive.  I was in a Lutheran Church
last Saturday (for a friend's wedding) and I noticed a brightly
colored (with rainbow) picture of the inhabitants of the ark coming
forth upon the finally dry (and cleansed?) land.  It was a large mural
covering an entire wall in the children's nursery.  It's probably a
good thing I resisted the temptation to add a few dead and rotting
bodily remains with an ink marker, that surely would have been left
over from what, if it really occured, was one of the most devastating
and destructive catastrophes during the history of mankind.

	But anyway, I wondered what the chance will be that, maybe
1000 years from now and more, one of the stories we all tell our
children (and make children's toys about and paint colorful depictions
of on the walls of nurseries with...), is how Robert Ettinger, and
others, tried to warn and convince the world of the doom they could
have avoided by simply taking proper actions.  The story would be very
similar in that only a relative hand full of people would heed his
warning and would make the eternal life saving effort, mostly because
of ancient religious ideas contained in stories like that of Noah and
the flood...  I can imagine toy dewers with little dolls representing
people and their pets nicely fitting inside along with the toy arks
and their animals...  (and cheesy animated videos...?  Nahh!)
Obviously, some of the actual survivors will be on hand to retell the
story first hand, giving it infinite more significance, as compared to
Noah who is now, if he was more than a cheesy animated character, long
dead and gone.

	Religion seems so completely ironic to me, as a cryonaut, in
so many never ending ways.  Wouldn't it be humorous if it wasn't so
tragic?

There is a distinct difference between preventing opportunities to access, and
allowing access to those who pay a fair market rate for such access. Failure to pay for access to information from which the accessor gains material benefit is theft. You are free to either originate your own information and give it away as you see fit, but you are not free to give away my information without paying for it, or by talking me into being as 'altruistic' as you. Forcing altruism denigrates the whole concept of altruism.

Or if special interest is served. If I'm a independent metallurgical researcher who develops a new alloying process, should the wealthiest metal corporations in the country or the world be able to use my process freely to its own huge benefit without compensating me? If one company pays me for the research, why should its competitors benefit from the investment that that one company made in the research?

In a free information society, those with the greatest means to realize benefits from the information will control it, i.e. the wealthiest corporations, because they can afford to get product to market quickest to seize market share. Information monopolies benefit the small startup proportionately far more than large corporations. Information rights is the most important issue of the next century, because it will determine whether our minds are enslaved to or freed from the government-industrial conglomerates. If you want a Matrix- like future, then eliminate intellectual property. Such a choice will quickly make us all just mental peas in a pod.

The south declared its independence as soon as Lincoln had won sufficient electoral votes to be declared president, because one of his Republican Party platform planks was in fact the abolition of slavery. At that time the Republican Party was more heavily weighted with slavery abolitionists than it is currently weighted with anti-abortionists. The emancipation proclamation was not a fact until several years into the war, so in that sense you are right, and the position of the southern states was constitutionally sound. That does not, however make the war not a war of ideas. Current day revisionists are starting to buy the long time revisionist position of southern historians, which call the Civil War the "War of Northern Agression", but what do they know? They might as well buy the neo-Nazi revisionism that WWII was "The War of Anglo-Russian Agression".

The US entered the war against Germany because as soon as we declared war against Japan for the Pearl Harbor attack (which at least some Americans knew something about, granted), Germany declared war on us and started sinking our own US flagged ships openly. Up to that point, they only sunk UK flagged ships coming from US ports and ships where no flag could be determined.

As Chamberlain's appeasement demonstrated,  the UK was definitely not interested in getting into a war, but did in fact honor its treaty commitments to Poland. Keep in mind that the Polish royals were related to the British royals...

Intellectual property rights are not observed by tyrants. Democratic states observe IP rights. That should be the end of the conversation.

You are confusing 9-track with 8 track. The first is a data format, the second is an audio format. My IBM mainframe definitely depends on clean tapes. 9-track does not degrade as quickly as you state because the tape is so wide and because the data density is so low. 1600 to 6250 bytes per inch of tape gives each byte a LOT of real estate to maintain a charge on. Degradation comes from a) moisture, b) oxidization, c) EMI. Stored properly, all of these sources are minimized. I can read 30 year old data very easily off of these tapes onto the mainframe. I do not listen to them with my ears...

Tapes do not rely on chemical reactions, but on magnetic fields. Granted, if the medium oxidizes, the fields are lost. Proper storage prevents oxidization. Of course the lowest quality tapes will degrade easier. Iron degrades far faster than, say, platinum, silver, or gold tapes.

ISRAELI SCIENTIST REPORTS DISCOVERY OF ADVANCE IN CODE BREAKING 
Israeli computer scientist Adi Shamir is expected to present a 
paper outlining the design of a yet-to-be-built-machine that could 
quickly decipher computer generated codes. Shamir -- who represents 
the 'S' in RSA encryption design -- will present his paper this week 
at the International Association for Cryptographic Research in 
Prague, which begins Monday. Shamir's idea would combine existing 
technology into a special task computer that would make factoring 
numbers as long as 150 digits much easier. As a result, codes accepted 
as reasonably secure for financial transactions and government 
communications would be much easier to decipher. Researchers say the 
machine could be built at a relatively low cost, and that key systems 
of 512 bits or less (keys of about 140 digits or less) would be 
vulnerable. Longer 1,024-bit keys would still be out of reach for 
Shamir's new machine. (New York Times 05/02/99)

How To Start A Profitable Advertising Specialty Business

Advertising specialties are small items like book matches, pens
or key chains that can be imprinted with a company, logo or
slogan.

They are deductible advertising and usually given away to promote
the business whose name is inscribed on them. There is almost no
limit to products that can be used as advertising specialties.
They can be anything the client company can afford, your
sponsoring company can imprint and the customer will use.

The ideal item is useful, costs comparatively little and keeps
your clients' business name in front of the customer as long as
possible.

Advertising Specialties is an ideal business to operate from
home. You can market them on a route, by mail, through
advertisements, by phone appointments or by personal contact.

There are two main objectives in establishing yourself in this
business.

The first is to let people know who you are, what you handle and
where they can get hold of you.

Second, convince them that you can help them promote their
business. Your experience and advertising knowledge level will
increase constantly. In turn, your expanding capability will
equip you to offer even better advice and more timely
suggestions.

Your customers are busy business people who want to get the most
of their advertising dollar and are not particularly
knowledgeable in this area. As soon as your customers realize
they can rely on your advice your success will be assured!

Advertising specialties include place mats, school football and
baseball schedules, calendars and plastic windshield scrapers,
which lend themselves well to thee seasons. These give you a good
opportunity to make timely and realistic suggestions to your
customers.

How do you make money doing this?

Here's a simple, PROVEN way to do it...

** Only do business with people who do business with you!  

So, when your insurance comes up for renewal -- explain to
your agent that you're in the 'specialty ad' business and 
you'd be glad to renew your policies IF he/she is good enough 
to place an order for (calendars, matches, golf balls, pens etc. 
-- whatever he/she might use anyway -- no extra cost)... and if 
your agent does not want to reciprocate, then renew your coverage 
with another agent who will.

And, what about the pharmacy that fills your RX, the gas station, 
the cleaners, etc. You've probably got 20 customers (easily) that 
you're spending money with right now who are prospects for advertising 
specialties.

This Is Easy Money!  It's Fun and Lucrative!

Is not magnetic tape already oxidized, as the material which carries the
magnetic domains is iron oxide?  Would not tapes made of platinum,
silver, or gold fail to work, as those materials are not ferromagnetic?

This, I think, confuses copyright with plagiarism.  No one is proposing
that I should be able to say that I wrote your poetry.  Abolishing
copyright would give me the ability to make copies of your poetry and give
it to others, with your name on it, without asking you first.

Many people believe that copyright is unjustified, because, unlike
stealing, when I copy your poetry, you still have a copy for yourself,
whereas if I were to steal your computer, only I would have the computer.
Others, acting on a more Lockean theory of property, might argue that
putting in the effort to creating a given piece of information gives one
the right to force others not to copy it.  I do not believe that there is
a fact of the matter at stake here.

With that being said, I think that actually enforcing copyright laws is
usually a waste of everyone's time and money, since copying is so easy and
so difficult to detect; most law enforcement agencies seem to agree with
me, and therefore don't even try to catch end consumers giving away the
product, but rather attempt to go after bulk producers selling their
product.  They, too, will eventually become impossible to catch, thanks
mostly to encryption technology and the work of anonymizers around the
world.

Nonetheless, there are some obvious advantages to enforcing copyright,
such as providing incentives for artists and inventors to do what they do.  
Without copyright, their works could only be sold at the cost it requires
to copy them; as a result, we might expect only to see cheap or free
innovations and far, far fewer private investments overall. However, since
the cost of trying to effectively enforce copyright is and will continue
to be very very high, these benefits may not outweight the cost involved
in enforcing the law.

I did want to add one thing to the cost issue, it really doesn't cost me 
that much to copyright my poetry. The money that can come in per royalties, 
is much greater than the copyright fee. Thirteen dollars or so a poem, 
depending on how many lines there are. I don't feel as though I'm feeding 
into any government hungerfest with that kind of economics. However as far 
as copyrights are concerned in other arenas, I haven't a clue (there may be 
some truth to the mentioned problems in other situations) and submit 
information from my perspective only towards copyrights, as a poet.

Scientists are solving the ultimate medical supply problem: new brains
Associated Press
BOSTON (AP) -- Scientists want to fix the things that go wrong inside your 
head. Their plan: Grow replacement parts for broken brains.
They make it sound easy. Just brew a batch of gray matter. Drill a hole in 
the skull. Put in the new stuff. Wire it up like the original.
Voila! New brains.
Despite its whiff of mad scientist run amok, this scenario is surprisingly 
close to reality. Researchers can already do amazing things with mouse 
brains. And as they so fondly and frequently point out, mice really are an 
awful lot like us.
Some human experiments already hint at what's possible. Since the 1980s, 
doctors have cautiously tested transferring brain cells from aborted fetuses 
to victims of Parkinson's disease. For some, it seems to work remarkably 
well, restoring lost control of movement.
But to those on the cusp of this new technology, Parkinson's is almost too 
easy. It involves the death of just one small bit of material, the brain 
cells that make the message-carrying neurotransmitter dopamine.
No, they have their sights on much more complicated targets. In the years to 
come, they see the possibility of rewiring broken spines, patching up 
strokes, correcting multiple sclerosis, undoing inherited metabolic 
disorders, maybe even rebuilding the wrecked brains of Alzheimer's disease 
victims.
"I mean not just putting in cells to produce a neurotransmitter or make a 
little local connection," explains Dr. Jeffrey Macklis of Children's 
Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. "I mean really rewiring 
complex circuitry in the brain. Ten years ago, this would have been 
considered totally crazy. Five years ago, it would have been a little 
bonkers."
Macklis goes on to talk about his mice, the critters of choice for those who 
study such things. When immature cells are transplanted under precisely the 
right conditions, they migrate across the animals' tiny damaged brains. They 
take root in just the spots where they are needed. They morph into the exact 
brands of cells that are missing. They connect up with other parts of the 
brain. In short, they seem to work.
"Mice brains are fundamentally not that different from humans'," says 
Macklis. "The idea of using immature cells and guiding their differentiation 
to rebuild complex circuitry is no longer crazy."
Until recently, human fetuses were the only source of brain material for 
such jobs, but they were never ideal. Doctors' qualms go beyond the ethical 
thickets of recycling aborted material. Fetuses will always be in short 
supply; it takes several to treat just one patient. And quality is hard to 
control, especially considering that many were aborted for a reason, such as 
genetic abnormalities.
But now scientists seem certain that transplanting brain material -- what 
they call cell therapy -- is about to become practical. The reason is the 
discovery of entirely new reservoirs of brain material. At dozens of 
universities and biotech firms, they are developing three main varieties -- 
animal brains, cancerous growths and the tissue wellspring called stem 
cells.
One of these sources can be found at a gleaming biomedical lab off a country 
road about 60 miles west of Boston. The first thing that makes the place 
seem a little odd is the technicians' get-ups: green surgical scrubs with 
knee-high black rubber boots. Then there's the smell.
Despite fans that turn over the air 19 times an hour and filter it cleaner 
than an operating room's, the lab carries a certain barnyard redolence, an 
unmistakable eau de pig. This lab is also a barn, home to 65 or so grunting, 
rooting animals. But the end product is brain parts, not pork chops.
"This is literally the cleanest pig facility on the face of the earth," says 
David Boucher, the veterinary technician who makes sure the walls sparkle, 
the germs stay far away and the animals themselves enjoy unpiglike 
spotlessness.
It may be the world's most expensive pig facility, too. The 275-pound 
Yorkshire sows -- "the girls," Boucher affectionately calls them -- cost 
between $20,000 and $30,000 apiece to raise this way. However, the price 
will fall dramatically if pig cells are approved for routine human medical 
use, and production scales up.
When it's time for a still-experimental transplant, the technicians kill 
three artificially inseminated pigs that have been pregnant exactly 27 days. 
Then they surgically remove their fetuses. (Killing the sows, they say, is 
the only way to get the unborn pigs out antiseptically.) It takes the brains 
of 26 pig fetuses to gather 48 million dopamine-producing cells, enough for 
one person with Parkinson's. The cells are shipped to a hospital, and less 
than 72 hours later, they are inside someone's brain.
So far, these pig cells have been tested on 20 people with Parkinson's, six 
with epilepsy and six with Huntington's disease. Of the first 11 Parkinson's 
patients treated, three improved significantly.
"I have no doubt this can work and produce tremendous benefit," says Dr. 
Greg Stewart of Genzyme, which is developing the treatment with [ Diacrin ] 
, another biotech firm.
While the supply of fetal pig cells is not a problem, there are other 
drawbacks. Patients may need to take immune-suppressing drugs to keep their 
bodies from rejecting the tissue, and there is a remote chance that 
dangerous animal viruses might be passed along.
"I don't think it's an elegant way to solve the problem," says Dr. Michael 
Levesque of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.
A bit more elegant, perhaps, is a method being tested at the University of 
Pittsburgh. Doctors there are experimentally transplanting human cells into 
the brains of stroke victims.
The cells are similar to stem cells, the factories that manufacture various 
kinds of tissue inside the body. But there's a catch: These cells began as 
cancer, grown in test tubes from a 22-year-old's testicular tumor.
The transplants are being tested on 12 stroke victims. All suffer paralysis 
or other serious disability, even though the strokes destroyed only a small 
bit of their brain tissue.
Three seem to have improved. One walks better, another is less stiff, while 
a third has better control of arm and leg movements. Are the extra cells 
responsible? Or is this the natural course of recovery?
Dr. Douglas Kondziolka, the surgeon in charge, does not know. Still, he 
says, "We were hoping for a glimmer of efficacy so we could continue on. 
We've seen even a little more than a glimmer."
Fixing a stroke, however, is far more challenging than relieving 
Parkinson's. A stroke leaves a dead zone inside the brain. Missing are many 
kinds of cells that were hooked up in complex patterns.
In their attempt at repair, surgeons add their cancer-derived cells to the 
ring of damaged tissue that surrounds the dead area. Just why this might do 
some good isn't completely clear. But the doctors speculate that the new 
cells help the hurt ones by restoring connections, releasing 
neurotransmitters and pumping in amino acids.
As best they can tell, the transplanted cells have been transformed from 
cancerous gonadal cells to stable nerve cells through a series of 
manipulations. But the idea of using cancer cells makes some doctors uneasy. 
Others worry that the challenges of repairing strokes are just too vast to 
even attempt yet.
"I do believe that we will be able to treat strokes and the more complicated 
disorders. I just don't think we're ready to do that yet," cautions Dr. John 
Kessler of Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City.
Many agree that the most elegant solution of all to the supply problem is 
stem cells. These are the body's mother cells. They divide over and over to 
form new tissue, such as blood cells and skin.
For generations, scientific dogma held that the adult brain cannot repair 
itself, because it lacks stem cells. Wrong. Recently, scientists found that 
adult brains do indeed harbor stem cells, although their exact function is 
still a mystery. But when coaxed properly in a test tube, they will divide 
over and over again, making brand-new neurons.
Suddenly, it seems, cancer cells and animal cells may be unnecessary. The 
real thing, human brain cells, will be available. But what kind of stem cell 
is the proper seed?
Since stem cells divide endlessly, a single sample started from a human 
fetus could provide all that's needed. But the recipient's immune system 
might attack these as foreign. Perhaps the patient's own body is a better 
source of stem cells.
At Cedars-Sinai, scientists isolate stem cells from tissue saved during 
brain operations on Parkinson's patients. In the lab, these stem cells 
produce new brain cells. These in turn mature into dopamine makers, the 
specific kind of brain cells that people with Parkinson's lack. Finally, 
they are put back into the patients' brains.
Even if this works, however, the approach has an obvious shortcoming. The 
only source of these brain stem cells is the patient's own brain, not a 
particularly accessible reservoir.
However, brain stem cells may not be a necessary ingredient for 
custom-making new brain tissue. Scientists believe it may be possible to 
reprogram more readily available kinds of stem cells, such as the ones that 
produce skin, so that they will churn out brain cells, instead.
But are transplants necessary at all? Maybe not. Repairs might actually be 
engineered by remote control without ever putting anything into the head.
Some scientists talk of stimulating the stem cells still inside the brain so 
they divide and send off new nerve cells. Farfetched as this sounds, they 
say it may be possible to direct the cells to travel to distant parts of the 
brain and then take on the specialized duties of cells that are missing or 
damaged.
Still, to cure a stroke or head injury, a reliable supply of brain cells is 
just the start. Somehow they must be wired up so each communicates with its 
neighbor in a sensible way.
"The biggest hurdle is not getting cells into the nervous system," says 
Kessler. "It's not getting them to differentiate and to live. The biggest 
hurdle is getting them to reconnect in the proper way. That is an 
extraordinarily daunting process, when you think of the billions of 
connections that have to be formed."
Yet scientists such as Macklis and Dr. Evan Snyder, a Children's Hospital 
colleague, think this is entirely possible. For one thing, their experiments 
suggest that damaged parts of the brain send out help signals that can 
recruit transplanted cells and show them what to do.
In mice, at least, immature neurons injected into the head will travel 
across the brain to where cells are dying. There they assume the form of the 
missing cells, stitching themselves seamlessly into the brain's circuitry.
Cells injected into the brain's fluid-filled ventricles eventually migrate 
all through the head. The researchers say such an approach might eventually 
conquer diseases that involve many parts of the brain.
The whole idea of bringing in replacement cells from someplace else grew out 
the belief that the brain cannot repair itself. But with the discovery of 
brain stem cells, that dogma is crumbling.
"Cell therapy might be even more interesting, not less," says Snyder. "Not 
only might it mean we put back cells that the brain does not grow on its 
own, but maybe we will do it by augmenting a natural response."
In short, these scientists envision a day when repairing a broken brain will 
involve no transplants, no operations. Instead, it will mean triggering the 
brain to awaken its supply of stem cells, to grow its own spare parts, to 
literally fix itself.

Starship To Carry Dna Into Deep Space
Florida Today

A starship destined for deep space soon will be boarding at a South American 
spaceport, and anyone with $60 can hitch a ride.

Genetically speaking, that is.

In a bizarre but potentially lucrative business venture, a spacecraft 
carrying the DNA of up to 4.5 million people will be launched in 2001 on a 
mission aimed at making contact with an alien civilization.

About 50,000 people - including famed science-fiction author Arthur C. 
Clarke and Alan Ladwig, NASA's chief of plans and policy - already have 
signed up. The company staging the flight expects that number to soar.

After all, you don't need a travel agent or a lot of money to book passage. 
A mere $49.95, plus $9.95 shipping and handling, will do.

"There is an intense amount of public interest in space, and when you add 
the element of being part of the mission, that's really the charm of it," 
said Charles Chafer, president of Encounter 2001 LLC, the company sponsoring 
the flight.

"An awful lot of people just like the notion of making a statement, of 
reaching out and knowing there's at least a small chance they'll be the ones 
to make first contact with another civilization."

The aliens, meanwhile, might be laying in wait.

As part of the deal, the company will beam up a hailing signal from a 
Ukrainian radio telescope May 24.

Targeted at distant stars that might harbor habitable planets, the 
high-power transmission will include greetings from those who have signed up 
for the flight. It will be repeated in February 2000 and February 2001.

"The cosmic calls are sort of a precursor to the mission itself, messages of 
introduction," Chafer said. "In effect, we're saying, `Ready or not, here we 
come.' "

The so-called "Milliennial Voyage" will set sail from French Guiana.

The cruise ship will be a small spacecraft that will carry the written 
messages, drawings, photos and DNA - in the form of human hair samples - on 
a journey out of the solar system.

First stop will be a transfer orbit 22,300 miles above Earth. A European 
Ariane rocket will haul the tiny emissary there after launch from Kourou 
Space Center.

Next will be a two-year journey to Jupiter. Caught up in the gravity of the 
giant planet, the 337-pound spacecraft ultimately will be flung on an 
unguided trajectory out of the solar system and into the unknown beyond.

"It becomes kind of a cosmic message in a bottle at that point," Chafer 
said. "And I think there's a lot of charm in not knowing exactly where it's 
going, other than it's leaving the solar system with as many as 4.5 million 
of our closest friends on board."

Peculiar space projects are nothing new to the Encounter 2001 group. The 
company is an offshoot of Celestis Inc., the Houston company that staged the 
world's first "space burial" in 1997.

For $4,800 each, Celestis launched the cremated remains of 1960s pop guru 
Timothy Leary, Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and 22 others into low 
Earth orbit.

The Encounter 2001 mission might prove to be even more profitable.

Market studies done by the company indicate that somewhere between 1.5 
million and 4.5 million people might take part in the flight.

The upper-end estimate would generate about $225 million.

"I can tell you the entire mission, spacecraft and launch costs, will be 
well under $20 million," Chafer said. "So it could be a very profitable 
business."

Encounter 2001 is billing the flight as "the first interstellar mission for 
everyone who believes that intelligent life exists beyond the solar system."

To take part, customers pay $49.95, plus shipping and handling for a poster, 
a membership card, a flight reservation certificate, a lapel pin, an 
"archival form" for a photograph and message, and a DNA sampling kit.

The DNA kit is nothing more than a small plastic bag for hair samples, which 
are a fertile source of DNA, the fundamental building block of all life on 
Earth.

The painful part: plucking six strands of hair, root and all.

"You have to get the root, that's the little bulb on the end, because that's 
where the best DNA is contained," Chafer said. "We've got a great picture of 
someone doing that to Arthur C. Clarke."

The hair samples are bagged by the customer and sent back to the company. A 
California lab then will use an 11-step process to dry, preserve and package 
the roots in batches of 10,000.

Flying along with the hair samples will be the content of all the archival 
forms, which will be scanned onto a CD hardened to withstand radiation.

The single-page documents contain the customer's name, address, country, 
planet, date of birth, gender, signature and mug shot.

There also is space for poetry, prose, musical scores and artwork or the 
type of written message penned by Clarke: "Fare well, my clone!"

Presumably, any advanced civilization that intercepted the Encounter 2001 
spacecraft might be technically capable of extracting and cloning the DNA 
samples.

And perhaps it's the shot at interstellar immortality that explains why 
customers are clamoring to join the Encounter 2001 flight crew.

"The response has been phenomenal," said company spokeswoman Susan 
Schonfeld. "People are just fascinated with space and space travel, and this 
truly is a way for the general public to participate."

Make sure you read the fine print, though.

The company is negotiating with zoos around the world, so the essence of 
your humanity might end up commingled with the DNA of lions and tigers and 
bears.

"We're hoping to have the animal kingdom represented on the flight, too," 
Schonfeld said. "It will be almost like a Noah's Ark from Earth going into 
deep space."

The previous location of my Web pages, Tezcat, has not only kicked the
bucket but stopped forwarding Web hits.  Although the company that ate
Tezcat, ripco.com, is currently hosting my pages (including "Coding a
Transhuman AI", "Algernon's Law", "Staring Into the Singularity", etc.),
as long as I've got to make the move anyway I might as well stop paying
hundreds of bucks for 2MB of disk space and an email address - Ripco
doesn't have a Telnet-only-account option, and I don't need to pay for dialup.

Anyone out there willing to give me a free account?  I don't know how
much of my traffic will transfer over, since most references (despite
all the warnings) are to the "tezcat" address instead of the "pobox"
forwarder, sigh sigh, at least my email is safe.  But if I can get "Ask
Jeeves" to update one reference, I should be able to offer at least a
few hundred hits per day.  I'll be happy to replace my current
not-doing-much-good banner exchange with any ads you serve, or put up an
ad for your site.  I don't believe I'm presently running any CGI.

For my money, what was simultaneously the most exciting and depressing
part of the Dawn of the Neurohacking Revolution was the discovery that
the immune system contains specific instructions that prevent it from
regenerating neurons, and that the instructions can be disabled.

Exciting:  You take a pill and your spinal cord regrows.  That's not an
"advance", that's Star Trek.  That's Dr. McCoy walking through the halls
of an Earth hospital in "STIV: The Voyage Home".

Depressing:  If you try to regenerate neurons, you'll probably destroy
the programming - there's almost certainly a reason why the immune
system is deliberately refusing to repair neurons.

The trick is of course to make the change local. Which is of course
one of those horrible medical implementation issues, but might be
solvable. Because neurons are also reasonably good at reorganizing
themselves, so while you might loose a bit of the original
connectivity of the broken spinal cord you get something
comparable. Much worse with the cortex, of course.

We are getting ready to host the web site for our local Extropian group in
Texas (the Textropians). We have 5 megs of web space, and I don't imagine
we'll be using most of it, so if your stuff fits in we'll be happy to add it
on. In the next month, our company will be starting up and we'll have our
own web server and domain name so space shouldn't be near as much of a
problem.

I may be able to help you with an e-mail address too, but I'll have to check
with Billy and see how the setup is going to work.

I should have said further oxidization. Some iron oxides are ferromagnetic, others are not. I'm not sure the proper molecule for the ferromagentic types, but once extra oxygen gets added on, its toast.  The precious metals apparently are alloyed or compounded with the ferrous oxide and aids stability. I'll check on this, but I do know that while standard old tapes will usually develop bad blocks near the beginning of the tapes (closest to the outside environment), the gold, platinum, and silver tapes tend to remain error free unless they've been misused. They also read and write much faster (fewer rewrites) than standard tapes. The other day I used a silver tape dated 1963 and it read and wrote cleanly.

Most of the texts of the great library were likely copies of the
Illiad and Odyssey. By all accounts there were a great redundancy
among the books (keeping many versions was of course a good way of
getting around copier's mistakes). 

Would the hellenic culture have brought us to a technological
revolution a millennium earlier if the library had remained? I
seriously doubt that, because the problems of classical technological
development were more social and cultural. A widespread view among the
thinkers that practical work was beneath them and that abstract ideas
with no empiricism was the most elegant form of knowledge,
anti-rational mystery cults, a society based on slavery and heavily
centralised command economies were some of the reasons the library
doesn't appear to have been the key to technological development. 

Still, one can dream about a world where Archimedes wasn't killed and
his tradition lived on, uniting with the Epicurean ideas described by
Lucretius. Then we might have been on our way towards the stars in
nanotech spaceships now. And half the crew would be named Marcus,
Gaius and Titus :-)

As Jocelyn mentioned, we're currently setting up our own server.  By the end
of the month we should be able to offer space on a 3 gig disk partition
(shared with a couple of other low-traffic sites), along with e-mail,
telnet, ftp, CGI and access to a IIS/ASP programming environment and SQL
server databases as needed.  If you want to migrate before then, we've got 5
megs of space from our ISP that we aren't using, which sounds like more than
enough.

Thanks for the elaboration.  Whereas most audio tapes, the kind I was
thinking of, are so-called 'normal bias' or 'Type I' tapes, and use an
iron compound, there are also so-called 'high bias' or 'Type II' audio
tapes which use chromium dioxide, and they are sometimes called 'metal
tapes'.   I checked one reference book which indicated that floppy
diskettes are coated with ferrite, and that modern hard disks are
aluminum, covered with a thin (0.05 to 0.2 micron) layer of cobalt, which
holds the data, topped by a thin layer of graphite.

No one can claim your work as theirs, ever, even without copyright--
that's simple fraud.  Why is it that those most in favor of copyright
seem to know so little about what it actually is?  Copyright is not
what prevents me from claiming I wrote your poem; it prevents me from
posting it on my site with the note "Here's a poem I like by Gina
Miller...".  It prevents me from publishing it a collection book, or
making an artistic variation of it.  Copyright has nothing to do with
protecting the "integrity" of your work or your credit--it's about
protecting your market from competition.  Whether or not that's a
good thing is still arguable, but let's call a spade a spade.

I am an author and programmer; I earn my living writing things, most
of which are copyrighted by my employer.  I am thoroughly convinced
that in a world without copyrights I would earn twice as much money
as I do now and produce better work, because my storehouse of
information to draw upon would be freer, and the demand would increase
for creative work that was timely and original.  Artists who cling
to copyrights like a security blanket deserve my "demeaning", and I
make no apology for it.

        Neal Stephenson, the author of _The Diamond Age_ and _Snow Crash_
just released his latest book _Cryptonomicon_ yesterday.  Unlike his other
books, it looks to be grounded mostly during this century, but revolves
around the history of encryption.  Within the first 20 pages, there is a
lot of talk about Godel and Turing.  Should be good.

Destruction of the library probably helped the development of scientific technological culture, because the loss of its knowledge, right or wrong, inspired generations of men to conduct original research using the scientific method to 'recover' that 'lost' knowledge. As a result we have reached ever higher levels of acheivement. I think that if the library had remained, we would have developed a system which prized respect for the old knowledge over the potential of new knowledge.

Huh? I don't see much evidence for this. Among the humanities it has
indeed caused much research, trying to piece together the *original*
Illiad or _The State_, but among the natural sciences there was never
the same recover-mentality, not even during the renaissance.

That is of course a danger. And I think we have seen the effects in
some parts of the humanities :-)

I don't "cling" to it or anything like a security blanket, I USE it.
It protect's my work in what ever terms you want to put it. I have no idea 
what your problem with what I said is I merely stated why I use it, for 
poetry (that I too have had published). As long as I'm writing, and the laws 
are set up as such I will continue to use them.
Here's more clarifications for you,


U.S. Copyright Law

Copyright is a form of protection provided by the laws of the United States 
(title 17, U.S. Code) to the authors of "original works of authorship" 
including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and certain other 
intellectual works. This protection is available to both published and 
unpublished works. Section 106 of the Copyright Act generally gives the 
owner of copyright the exclusive right to do and to authorize others to do 
the following:

-- To reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;

-- To prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;

-- To distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the 
public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or 
lending;

-- To perform the copyrighted work publicly, in the case of literary, 
musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures 
and other audiovisual works; and

-- To display the copyrighted work publicly, in the case of literary, 
musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, 
graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion 
picture or other audiovisual work.

It is illegal for anyone to violate any of the rights provided by the Act to 
the owner of copyright. These rights, however, are not unlimited in scope. 
Sections 107 through 119 of the Copyright Act establish limitations on these 
rights. In some cases, these limitations are specified exemptions from 
copyright liability. One major limitation is the doctrine of "fair use," 
which is given a statutory basis in section 107 of the Act. In other 
instances, the limitation takes the form of a "compulsory license" under 
which certain limited uses of copyrighted works are permitted upon payment 
of specified royalties and compliance with statutory conditions. For further 
information about the limitations of any of these rights, consult the 
Copyright Act or write to the U.S. Copyright Office....

In theory, perhaps.  In practice, there isn't anything you can do about it
unless you also have copyright protection.  This is because you can only sue
over a fraud that causes monetary damage of some kind - and if your work is
not protected by copyright, you can't possibly prove such harm.

If I post someone's work as my own, we have the case mentioned above.  If I
publish it with no attribution at all, the only law I have violated is the
copyright.

I'm not a big fan of current copyright law, but I think you've gone off the
deep end here.  Time for a litte perspective:

First, allow me to point out that a programmer is in a completely different
situation that a novelist, an artist, or a film producer.  We programmers
are in the business of building complex machines that do things for our
customers.  It just so happens that the machines we make cost essentially
nothing to duplicate, but that doesn't mean people can just run off their
own copies with complete impunity.  Even in the absence of copyright law
many people will voluntarily pay for a program, for the simple reason that
they want you to support it.  They want tech support, bug fixes, version
upgrades, and all the other fringe benifits that come from being an actual
customer of the software's authors.

Thus, software authors can survive and profit even in the absence of
copyright enforcement.  We can see good examples of this today in the case
of the organizations that are making money selling copies of Linux - the OS
is actually free, but many people will buy it anyway so that they can get
the support they need.

For writers, musicians, and other such content creators, the situation is
completely different.  Once produced, their works are completely static
bodies of information.  You don't have to worry about version 2.0, or bug
fixes, or compatability with other products, or any other such support
issues.  Consequently, there is no particular reason why anyone would ever
need to bother with paying the author.  Abolishing copyright would
completely destroy the monetary value of such works, leaving their authors
with no means of getting paid.

Value would then rest solely in the ability to deliver products to
customers, which means the distributors and/or manufacturers would take
over.  Since any new offering would be immediately copied by a distributor's
competitors, the incentives to create new material would be rather limited.
At best, content creators would all end up working low-paying jobs for
various distribution companies.  Many types of content creation would
probably vanish completely - it would be very difficult to profit from
anything with significant production costs in such an environment.

In view of this, I would suggest a much more limited revision of current
practice:

1) Copyright should only prevent commercial duplication and resale of a
copyrighted work.  Any sort of duplication and re-use that does not involve
money changing hands should be legal.  This step removes almost all of the
usual reasons for objecting to copyright law, and the only authors it is
likely to hurt are those who demand inflated prices for their works.

2) Software should be recognized as a new intellectual field, in which
neither patents nor copyrights make any sense.  I'm not sure what the best
arrangement here would be, but the arguments have absolutely nothing to do
with the debate over traditional intellectual property.

On the contrary, the whole alchemy/chemistry area developed out of 'recovering' the secrets of the ancient philosphers. Middle age europe lost the secret of roman concrete, and european kings all wanted to know how to build structures like the pyramids using the magical methods that myth purported they were built with.

Moreover, the scarce information left about the lost 'Atlantis' inspired Columbus in his quest for the new world. If there had been more substantial supporting 'evidence' for the Ptolemaic solar system, Copernicus and Galileo might have been supressed even more violently than they were. Leaving more accurate maps of the egyptian area would have caused the death of egyptology, because the antiquities would have been pillaged all the more sooner before controls were set in place.

The humanities were left with the most information, and have resulted in the above. The hard sciences were starved of data and look what resulted.

I have no problem with you personally using whatever means are at
your disposal--I am arguing against the existence of those means in
the first place.  When 95% of the population believes something,
it's hard to fault one individual for following the crowd, so I
apologize if that sounded like a personal slur.  In today's world,
individual artists may indeed need copyrights--because the market
and common practices are set up under the assumption of their use.
But that view is short-sighted.  Extropians should be more forward-
looking and willing to see beyond the next meal, next quarter, or
even next century.

I believe that copyrights and patents are shackles holding back
human progress, and I have spent a long time fighting them and
fighting the common misconceptions about them.  Rest assured, I
know the precise details of copyright and patent law to the letter,
can quote the Feist and Markman decisions from memory, and keep up
with all the treaties that are making things even worse.  It is not
from ignorance that I protest.  Sometimes you have to jump out of
the system for a while and imagine a very different world.  Some
of that world I've detailed before many times here (you can find
much discussion in the archives--just look for a thread with lots
of posts by me and Michael Lorrey :)

That's partly true, in practice.  But a finding of fraud would not
require harm to the author--it would require harm to the consumer,
also hard to prove but not impossible.  In a world without copyrights,
the author's physical availability, timeliness, and other intangibles
will have significant monetary value beyond the mere product.  One
who represents that ey can provide those values when ey cannot has
done measurable, prosecutable harm to customers and to the reputation
of the original author.  In a world without copyrights, these things
would have to be taken more seriously by the courts; today, authors
rely on copyrights instead.

Very true.  The abolition of copyright in software (and the even more
hideous impediment of software patents) is much easier than the case
for novels and movies, because it requires less imagination (we have
existing examples to point to).

That's two different contentions that you intermix: (1) destroying the
value of the work itself, and (2) destroying the artists' means of
making money.  Today, because of copyright, it is assumed that they
are the same thing--artists make money by selling their works.  In a
world without copyrights, things change, but artists still make money--
probably more--just in different ways.  Value is created by demand,
and the creative talents of artists will always be in demand.  Today,
authors do free tours to support book sales.  Without copyright, they'd
probably sell books to advertise profit-making personal appearances
or other services.  Books and movies would have more advertisements.
There would be a lot of cheap knock-off works, so official endorsements
and recommendations would carry more weight (and therefore more value).
Without copyrights, the artist's research is cheap and easy.  Ey gets
hired for a lot more one-off work doing things like news and commercials.
Ey gets hired to help translate, interpret, and adapt others' work.
Yes, abolishing copyright reduces the marketability of the work product.
But it does nothing to the real value--the artist's creative work
itself.  And it makes the work products of all artists available to
everyone--including other artists--to the benefit of all.

I've spoken a lot more about this in the archives, so forgive me for
being short here, but I haven't had a good debate on the subject in a
while, so I'm due for some exercise.

I was just reading through the latest Politech email from Declan McCullagh,
and this article caught my eye.. it's an in-depth report on the feasibility
of creating conventional, inexpensive EMP (electromagnetic pulse) weapons,
not sure of the publication date, but it certainly seems right up the
extropian alley.  For one thing, relating to the current conversation on
data storage tech, we're not even looking at the possibility - no, the
virtual *certainty* - that such weapons, and the use of such, will become
widespread.  When one considers this, we're right back to chiseling on
stones..

http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/kopp/apjemp.html

Excellent report, full of pictures, diagrams, and decodings of those
annoying acronyms... worth taking a look at.

I'd like to add that Marc Stiegler is the author of "The Gentle
Seduction", one of the first and best Singularity-based short stories. 
I haven't read the book yet, but if it's Marc Stiegler I'll certainly
plan to.

I can knock out my own argument I proposed last week: that there
was probably no technology in the great library that we have not
greatly exceeded.  I thought of an honest to Greek gods *technology*
that they had, that we do not have now: how to make stone arches.

Today stone arches are approximated.  Usually they are fake: the
arch is made of cement with fake lines drawn in the wet facade.

Consider this, those of you who are mechanically inclined.  Draw an
arch.  Put in lines perpendicular to the arch that describe a number
of wedge shaped stones.  Challenge: draw the lines in such a way
that each stone is in pure compression (no part of the stone may
be in bending moment) and there is no shear force at the interfaces
between the stones.

Another way to state the problem is this: shape your stones such
that the force vectors from the adjacent stones exactly equals the
gravitation
vector.  Obviously, the included angle in the top stone would be larger
than the stone that whose centerline is 30 degrees from horizontal.
In fact, the included angle of each stone is different from all the rest.

Can you calculate all the included angles without your computer?
Can you calculate them *with* your computer?
Evidently the Greeks knew how to do these stone arches.

The *buyer* can sue, as she is the harmed party, not the original

I occasionally support government legislation as a means of doing things
that just can't be done with current technology.  Copyright is a case in
point.  Using nothing but contracts, you could easily say:  "Nobody has
access to this information unless they promise not to give it to anyone
else."  Which gives you the same effect as current copyright law.  If
anyone is responsible for leaking information, at any point in their
whole life, nobody ever shares anything with them again and they may be
liable for an arbitrarily large amount of legal damages.  Furthermore,
by using my copyrighted material, you agree not to use anyone else's
copyrighted material that may have been published by someone else.

This condition - requiring more computing power and better tracking than
we now have - can be duplicated by creating copyright legislation that
people can "opt out" of.  In other words, Lee Daniel Crocker can decide
to ignore copyrights (and lose the ability to copyright his own work),
but then his favorite comics pages might refuse to let him in, and some
employers wouldn't hire him.

Our modern haphazard copyright enforcement is actually better, because
without the patina of voluntary compliance, it's morally easier to
advocate changes to the system and ignore the unjust parts.

How To Start A Profitable Advertising Specialty Business

Advertising specialties are small items like book matches, pens
or key chains that can be imprinted with a company, logo or
slogan.

They are deductible advertising and usually given away to promote
the business whose name is inscribed on them. There is almost no
limit to products that can be used as advertising specialties.
They can be anything the client company can afford, your
sponsoring company can imprint and the customer will use.

The ideal item is useful, costs comparatively little and keeps
your clients' business name in front of the customer as long as
possible.

Advertising Specialties is an ideal business to operate from
home. You can market them on a route, by mail, through
advertisements, by phone appointments or by personal contact.

There are two main objectives in establishing yourself in this
business.

The first is to let people know who you are, what you handle and
where they can get hold of you.

Second, convince them that you can help them promote their
business. Your experience and advertising knowledge level will
increase constantly. In turn, your expanding capability will
equip you to offer even better advice and more timely
suggestions.

Your customers are busy business people who want to get the most
of their advertising dollar and are not particularly
knowledgeable in this area. As soon as your customers realize
they can rely on your advice your success will be assured!

Advertising specialties include place mats, school football and
baseball schedules, calendars and plastic windshield scrapers,
which lend themselves well to thee seasons. These give you a good
opportunity to make timely and realistic suggestions to your
customers.

How do you make money doing this?

Here's a simple, PROVEN way to do it...

** Only do business with people who do business with you!  

So, when your insurance comes up for renewal -- explain to
your agent that you're in the 'specialty ad' business and 
you'd be glad to renew your policies IF he/she is good enough 
to place an order for (calendars, matches, golf balls, pens etc. 
-- whatever he/she might use anyway -- no extra cost)... and if 
your agent does not want to reciprocate, then renew your coverage 
with another agent who will.

And, what about the pharmacy that fills your RX, the gas station, 
the cleaners, etc. You've probably got 20 customers (easily) that 
you're spending money with right now who are prospects for advertising 
specialties.

This Is Easy Money!  It's Fun and Lucrative!

The architects and masons did indeed look backwards to antique
architecture long before the humanists did. However, I have not seen
much evidence that they were trying to re-create the lost knowledge,
they were rather trying to create something that worked and drew
inspiration from the roman constructions. As for finding the magical
building methods, as far as I know there were no attempts to do them.

What is the evidence for this being a more important factor than
finding a trade route to India?

No, rather the opposite. Their claims would have been less convincing,
and hence less of a threat. So they might not have been suppressed,
but instead their ideas could have remained forgotten for a long time.

Crime lab on credit card unveiled

Scripps Howard News Service

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.  The Department of Justice announced in Albuquerque
Monday a five-year, $25 million research program to bring genetic
testing directly to the crime scene on a credit card-sized lab on a
computer chip. 

Announcing the program on behalf of Attorney General Janet Reno, Jeremy
Travis said the project aims to have a forensic DNA chip in police
forensic crime units within two years. 

However, experts with Nanogen, a San Diego genetic-testing company that
is working with the Justice Department, said perfecting the technology
may take several more years. 

Travis said the technology isnt just a question of making law
enforcement easier and more effective, but a question of real justice.
He said some 28 convicted individuals have been released in recent years
based on new DNA evidence that showed they did not commit the crime of
which they were convicted. 

This chip can be a powerful crime-fighting tool because of its speed of
analysis and the vast amount of important DNA evidence it can contain
and its economy, Travis said, noting that the chips should cost $10 to
$25 each. 

They would be used to assess the DNA in blood, hair or semen samples
collected directly at a crime scene and then identify potential suspects
contained in the FBIs national genetic database. 

The database is a growing collection of individual DNA fingerprints 
sequences of DNA collected from criminals that uniquely identifies them,
just as their fingerprints would. 

DNA is the biochemical code of life that comprises the genes in human
cells. It confers inherited characteristics to future generations and it
is also what makes individuals unique. 

Lisa Forman, a scientist in the Justice Departments Office of Science
and Technology, acknowledged the project could face objections from
civil libertarians concerned with the potential for abuse. 

Among these might be the development of a national database including
all citizens, or the use of medical genetic data obtained from health
centers or hospitals.

He apparently associated the preponderance of stories of earthquakes and volcanos in the 'indies' with the stories of the destruction of the lost Atlantis, thinking that this Isle beyond the Pillars of Heracles was just another Oriental island.

Possibly, but supressed or forgotten, the effect is the same..

I can state for a fact that this knowledge is not lost, only out of use due to its expense. In the late 1800's, John Rockefeller owned most of what is now Acadia National Park, on Mount Desert Island in Maine. He built several of his typical 'country cottages' of  100 rooms or more, and built 57 miles of carriage roads to ride his horses on. Every bridge along the carriage roads was built of hand hewn granite, just as was done by the greeks and romans. These are some of the most beautiful stone arch bridges you can find anywhere, but you will rarely find anyone today who will pay for such collossal wastes of money. Rockefeller is quoted as saying he might as well have built them out of diamonds, for all their cost.

So do modern archaeologists.  They have even reconstructed the exact methods
used by architects of different cultures, and they often use these
comparisons as a means of measuring cultural influence between different
regions.

The only reason it sounds hard is that you're trying to construct a perfect
simulation of the problem - something that was not even remotely conceivable
to the ancients.  The Greeks (and other ancient cultures) developed
arch-building techniques purely by trial-and-error, and they had no idea why
things had to be done the way they were.  You can easily duplicate this
process just by studying an existing arch and copying it.

Under current law, the customer can't do a thing about it unless he can
prove monetary damages.  In most cases there is no such harm, or it is
purely hypothetical (and thus almost impossible to prove).  If the purloined
item is a peice of software you might conceivably have a case, but for
something like a book or a song you're going to be laughed out of court.
What you are realy looking for here is a new, much more expansive fraud
statute that makes lying about the origin of a work illegal per se.

You claimed that copyright law is purely a matter of forcing payment.  I'm
pointing out that this is not the case.  Copyright is the only law that
prevents wholesale alteration and misattribution of intellectual property by
anyone who cares to do so.  If you want to abolish copyright, you will need
to set up some other system to handle these issues - unless you favor making
all of these activities legal.

There is no such thing as intrinsic economic value.  The amount of money you
can sell a work for depends entirely on the context (social, legal and
economic) in which you are making the sale.  Changing copyright law changes
this context, and can easily have very large effects on the outcome.
Abolishing copyright makes it almost impossible to establish any meaningful
property right to a work, and therefore makes it very difficult to make
money by selling it.

Really?  How?  If you abolish copyright, their products are no longer even
recognized as property.

In a medium that is difficult and expensive to duplicate, you might be
correct.  However, we are rapidly moving towards a world where just about
anything can be duplicated quickly and easily.  This creates a world in
which some sort of copyright enforcement far more important than in the
past.

For an example, lets look at the music industry.  Here we have a product
that can be duplicated for just about zero cost, sold over the Internet, and
stored and duplicated ad infinitum by the customer.  If mass duplication
were legal, who exactly would have enough bargaining power left to actually
get paid?

Well, music distribution companies could earn a small return by offering a
convenient place to find high-quality recordings.  Music production outfits
could earn a meager living making recordings for the distributors.  No one
can get a competitive advantage by originating new content, because it can
be copied by all the major distributors within a matter of hours.  So, the
distributors still want a stream of new products to sell, but they can't
afford to spend much money on them.

The most likely result is a world where composers and musicians are paid
tiny sums of money (propably on an hourly or salaried basis), profit margins
are razor-thin for the entire industry, music is very cheap - and really
talented individuals find something more profitable to do with their lives.

So, do you disagree with my analysis, or is this the kind of world you want?

Personal appearances have profit potential only for a tiny group of
especially famous authors.  For everyone else, they are an advertising
expense that the publishers fund in order to boost sales.

Without copyright, the publishing industry would still be controlled by the
publishers (since actually manufacturing the books would be the major
expense).  Popular authors would make a little more than musicians, since it
takes longer to copy a new book than it does to duplicate a new album.
However, the basic dynamic is the same - the content creators loose all of
their bargaining power, and end up being owned by distribution and/or
manufacturing companies.

> There would be a lot of cheap knock-off works, so official

So I, the consumer, will pay extra for a book that's endorsed by a famous
author, and he'll get a kickback?  I don't think so.  I'll walk over to the
next rack, and buy an identical book from a different company for $1 less.
After all, it would be perfectly legal for a different company to duplicate
the endorsement without paying for it.

> Without copyrights, the artist's research is cheap and easy.

Most research is already cheap and easy.  Where it is not, the costs have
more to do with technological limitations than copyright issues.  Software
development is the only field I can think of where getting rid of copyrights
would have a meaningful benificial result in this respect - and I've already
said I think that is a completely different case.

> Ey gets hired for a lot more one-off work doing things like news and
> commercials.

How exactly would the absence of copyright make content creators bigger
celebrities?  Or are you saying celebrity appearances would be more in
demand for some reason?  Unless one of these things is true, you are simply
saying "they'll go find work in some other idustry".  Presumably true, but
it is not a benificial result.

I don't think that with the technology we have now we can construct the massive pyramids, temples, and stadiums the ancients built. They had no cranes, bulldozers, or CAD, but they were able to position stones-transported from quarries, to heights one would think might have been impossible. We still don't know who built Stonehenge or how they transported those massive stones. We still can't construct Crystal Skulls without tool markings.

Hewlitt-Packard, I was told but can't verify yet, did a rigorous analysis of the Crystal Skulls but didn't reveal their findings. HP says this was to prevent the leaking of trade secrets.

There are also pyramids in China, Mexico/Middle America, Japan, and Sudan. Easter Islands stone heads also make mincemeat of our preconceived notions that the ancients were technologically primitive

In Egypt there are underground corridors with paintings and bas-reliefs on the walls. No evidence of torchmarks on the ceilings. Imhotep calculated the circumference of the earth to about 25,000 miles, pretty impressive for some primitives. About 1000 years before Imhotep, Berossus(if I got his name right), a Sumerian priest, did the same. The Dogon tribe in Mali knew of the existence of Sirius A&B before western astronomy did, so do the Hopi tribe in the US.

These are just a few examples and I can give many more if you like, of these scientific anomalies.

Ra - (no pun intended)

This is an often heard claim, but if you start to examine it it falls
apart. We can definitely build the pyramids today if we wanted to -
the stones are well within what cranes can handle. The other
structures are much less complex - try comparing the size of (say)
Acropolis with a modern skyscraper or cathedral. Still, it is
impressive that they managed to build them.

The crystal skulls are an interesting case. I saw a program on
Disocvery that had some rather convincing indicia that the famed
crystal skulls really derived from Bavaria in the early 19th
century. And the microphotos they showed really did have tool marks.

Please read the sceptics website. Most of these claims are disproven
rather throughly.

Sure, the ancients were no fools and worthy much respect. But it is
better to respect them for what they really did rather than what we
ascribe to them.

These are scientific "anomalies" only if you apply that term to
simple problems that scientists have a too pitifully limited
imagination to find the simple solutions.  In many of these cases,
such as pyramid building methods, /engineers/ have tried to
re-create what ancients might have done--and succeeded in every
case.  The crystal skulls are trivial, for instance: tool marks
can be removed by the simple expedient of sitting them in a
running stream for a few years.  Hardly high tech.  Stones even
as large as those on Easter Island have been moved using nothing
more than mechanical devices made from logs and muscle power.
There may well be one or two technologies lost, but if any of
them have any practical use today, they'll be found again in no
time.  If not, then what do they matter?

Well, not really.  I am still a libertarian--if you can't prove

that the act is morally wrong.

Wholesale redistribution and alteration, yes, I want to make legal.
Misattribution, well, that's still the tricky fraud case above.

Exactly what I just said--what are you arguing here?  Yes, abolishing
copyright destroys the value of the work as property.  That's exactly
what I've been saying, and exactly what I want.  What I am arguing is
that does NOT limit the ways in which an artist can make money--it
only limits one method, i.e., selling the work as property.  Read the
archives and this message again for all the other ways I have proposed,
and use your imagination a little.

Live performance cannot be duplicated.  Endorsement cannot be duplicated.
Personal access to the performer cannot be duplicated.  In today's world,
performers rarely, for example, do commercial work because of some idiotic
idea that it is "beneath" them.  If they weren't sitting in the ivory
tower of copyright, they might actually have to work for a living by
singing jingles and doing bar mitzvahs, and the less competent singers
now doing those things would be employed in something better suited to
/their/ particular talents.

What if the authorized copy had a coupon for a discount on the
author's next work?  A live signature?  Admission to an internet
discussion group where the author participates?  Subsciption to
a newsletter by the author?  I repeat again: use your imagination
a little.  There are /thousands/ of ways to earn money without
copyright; I'm sure I've only scratched the surface.

Artists are celebrities now.  They generally don't do that kind of
work because they don't have to--they can work for a while, sell an
album, then sit on their ass and collect royalties.  Without that,
they'd find other work because they'd have to.

Yes, I absolutely agree with you that the world I recommend would be
a worse deal than artists have today.  So what?  Why should artists
get special privileges others don't?  Why should they be allowed to
keep getting paid for yesterday's work when craftsmen and engineers
have to keep working to earn a living?  Is there something special
about creative work as opposed to physical or mental labor that
warrants special treatment?  I don't think so.  The world needs both
creators and builders; inventors and craftsmen; authors and book-
binders; sculptors and quarrymen.  I see no reason for society to
value one above another in culture, and certainly not in law.

Why on Earth not?  We can build as big a pile of rock as you want - you just
have to be prepared to pay for it.  By modern standards there is nothing
especially challenging about any of these 'great wonders'.  Stone
construction is a somewhat neglected art (because it isn't cost effective),
but there is nothing magical about it.

Actually, we know exactly how most of the famous cases were built.
Archaeologists have duplicated in great detail the methods used by Egyptians
to build the pyramids and temples.  They've also done a good job on the
methods used in Greece, England and on Easter Island.  In every case there
is no magic or advanced technology involved - just old-fashioned
craftsmanship and a massive amount of human labor.

> We still can't construct Crystal Skulls without tool markings.

Don't be silly.  We can shape and polish just about anything to near-atomic
precision using the same techniques currently used for making telescope
mirrors.  The result will have no tool marks at all.

Sound like conspiracy theory nonsense to me.  Didn't the Skeptical Enquirer
people debunk that whole crystal skulls thing a few years ago?

And your point is?

I understand that a few years back a team of grad students, working
alongside a couple of local craftsmen, were able to quarry, work, transport
and erect another statue using nothing but hand tools and manual labor.
Easter Island is a tribute to the ability of relatively small groups of
primitive humans to accomplish impressive feats.  It is not indicative of
the presence of advanced technology.

So?  Again, the professionals say they've got a pretty good idea how
everything in Egypt was built, and I've seen enough of the details to be
convinced.

Yes, and the Greeks calculated both the size of the Earth and the distance
to the Moon.  Big deal.  All you need to do that is a basic knowledge of
geometry, a good eye, and some imagination.  Again, I see this as a tribute
to the human ability to work wonders with the most feeble of tools.

Last I heard, this whole idea had been thoroughly discredited.  Do you have

I've often wished that books and music were distributed on a shareware
basis.  I'd happily have paid a buck apiece for each song and book I
liked enough to listen to/read more than twice - including the books I
bought used - and the author would still make more than they do now,
assuming zero cost of production (ebooks).  Not only that, but I could
voluntarily pay extra for books like "Permutation City" or "True Names".

How To Start A Profitable Advertising Specialty Business

Advertising specialties are small items like book matches, pens
or key chains that can be imprinted with a company, logo or
slogan.

They are deductible advertising and usually given away to promote
the business whose name is inscribed on them. There is almost no
limit to products that can be used as advertising specialties.
They can be anything the client company can afford, your
sponsoring company can imprint and the customer will use.

The ideal item is useful, costs comparatively little and keeps
your clients' business name in front of the customer as long as
possible.

Advertising Specialties is an ideal business to operate from
home. You can market them on a route, by mail, through
advertisements, by phone appointments or by personal contact.

There are two main objectives in establishing yourself in this
business.

The first is to let people know who you are, what you handle and
where they can get hold of you.

Second, convince them that you can help them promote their
business. Your experience and advertising knowledge level will
increase constantly. In turn, your expanding capability will
equip you to offer even better advice and more timely
suggestions.

Your customers are busy business people who want to get the most
of their advertising dollar and are not particularly
knowledgeable in this area. As soon as your customers realize
they can rely on your advice your success will be assured!

Advertising specialties include place mats, school football and
baseball schedules, calendars and plastic windshield scrapers,
which lend themselves well to thee seasons. These give you a good
opportunity to make timely and realistic suggestions to your
customers.

How do you make money doing this?

Here's a simple, PROVEN way to do it...

** Only do business with people who do business with you!  

So, when your insurance comes up for renewal -- explain to
your agent that you're in the 'specialty ad' business and 
you'd be glad to renew your policies IF he/she is good enough 
to place an order for (calendars, matches, golf balls, pens etc. 
-- whatever he/she might use anyway -- no extra cost)... and if 
your agent does not want to reciprocate, then renew your coverage 
with another agent who will.

And, what about the pharmacy that fills your RX, the gas station, 
the cleaners, etc. You've probably got 20 customers (easily) that 
you're spending money with right now who are prospects for advertising 
specialties.

This Is Easy Money!  It's Fun and Lucrative!

Nova did a four part series of modern archeologists attempting to use
the methods they think may have been used to build Stonehenge, the roof
of the Colosseum, Inca stone works, and the Egyptian obelisk:
http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/lostempires/

They were successful with everything except the obelisk, which they are
going to try again.  They couldn't even use the wheel, and were able to
transport blocks big enough for Stonehenge.  Moral:  moving around big
blocks of stone is a huge pain, but it doesn't require a high level of
technology, just a lot of people.

Favorite moment: in attempting to move giant stone blocks in the manner
of the Incas, they hired a number of local villagers.  They interviewed
one of the villagers on camera, and he said "I knew we could do it.  If
our ancestors could do it, we could do it.  Human labor can accomplish
anything."

Here's a Peruvian villager who does physical labor, probably has minimal
access to medical care or communication technology, yet has infinite
optimism about what human beings can do.  That guy is an Extropian and
doesn't know it yet.

BTW: Thanks, Doug, for your post several months back on using methcobalamin as therapy
for alzheimer's.
My mother had been in a long downward spiral for many years and had reached the point at
which she just sat and stared.
I figured, what did she have to lose, talked her Doc into writing an order for that and
some high powered antioxidants. The methcobalamin was hard to get, but its not
expensive, unlike the prescription meds we tried previously. (Not very effective)
She has been improving ever since. She's much more alert, cheerful, seems to enjoy life
again.
 Although she probably lost a large amount of her past, who knows, that may return also.
At least we are able to hold a conversation with her now and she seems to be able to
make some new memories.

Billy, do you then suppose the Greeks did not figure out the formula
for the arches in closed form?  They had mathematics.  I would be
disappointed if they did them by eyeball, but now that I think it over
I suspect you are right.  Think Ill go check out that national park in
Maine.  {8-]  spikus

The lower courses of the Temple of Jupiter at Baalbeck are, according to the
quotes I have seen, too massive to be moved using currently available
technology.   Now, these may be quotes from engineers who have vested interests,
or they might be correct.

I'd be interested in some comments from some actual engineers, because otherwise
we'll have yet another round of opinion-waving.

I have also seen footage of engineers saying that it is technically impossible
to align a site as large as the Great Pyramid at Giza with the accuracy the
pyramid displays.  There's more to it than just moving rocks about.

I'd like to see something on the bottom of web pages which allowed you to
make a donation of a small amount, a cent or so, to the author if you really
liked the page.  The internet-as-busking analogy is a nice one.

I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't develop a closed form. First,
the idea of closed form solutions was much later, the Greeks mainly
relied on geometrical construction. Second, the artisan class was
fairly divorced from the philosophers even if they did use some of the
practical results of geometry. My impression, admittedly not an expert
opinion, is that Greek architecture was very much a craft with plenty
of internal knowledge but not that much overarching theory (sorry for
the pun).

A quick look at the some websites mentions a 1000 ton carved stone in
the quarry, and the Trilithon of three 800 ton stones. This is
definitely in the range of modern technology (the "turtle" they move
the space shuttle on can carry much more). 

BTW, what would the vested interests of the engineers have been? A way
of avoiding having to move the stones?

Maybe the claim is simply a misunderstanding: the engineer was
referring to a disbelief in how the ancients could have done it, and
then it was repeated too much to become a claim about current
inability. It fits into the "lost golden age"-meme receptors fairly
well.

AFAIK, the idea of constructing mathematical models of planned buildings
only dates back to the 16th or 17th century.  The ancients used geometry and
astronomy to lay out building sites, and the Greeks used geometry to do some
fairly subtle work in planning the appearance of buildings, but there was no
concept of predicting the behavior of a pile of stone.  There were just too
many intervening concepts that had yet to be invented.

With the horsepower of large bulldozers like a D-9, and since archaeologists have already demonstrated elevating and capping the trilons at Stonehenge with only a few hundred people and simple stone age leverage devices, we could easily build the pyramids over again. As I recall, one gentleman in California or Oregon built a copy of the pyramid, I think at 1/2 scale, in only a few months with a crane. It used stone blocks which were more rough cut than those in Egypt, but that was a cost saving measure, so he did not fit them to the same tolerance. Precision stone cutting is very expensive these days.

That's crap. The Great Pyramid was aligned to the tolerance of the method they used for calculating true north. The the surveying techniques we use today are virtually unchanged from those developed in those ancient times (with the exception of modern optics and lasers). In place of optics, peephole sights were used, which are so accurate that many snipers prefer peepholes to the modern optical scopes. Using a large scale (10' diameter) sundial, some knowledge of astronomy (of which the egyptians were without equal in that day and age), and a peephole sight mounted on a tripod, you could estimate true north with the same accuracy.

You mean the mounds? Pure human drudgery moving earth.

Stone construction is not done today simply because it is too expensive to cut and fit stone to the tolerances needed, and stonework is far too intolerant of seismicand other ground shifting disturbances. Note that the Roman Republic was so adamant about the tolerances of their stone cutting that contractors only got paid 50% of a project cost until the project was still standing 40 years later. Modern developers could not operate with such financial restrictions, nor do we want them to, since the average lifespan of a modern building is around 35 years. They typically either get torn down or destroyed in a disaster or war by then.

Proof of the inadequacy of stone construction: The National Cathedral, the last stone construction building in the US, has taken over 70 years to complete.

There is no particular limit to how big an object can be moved with current
technology.  Once you get bigger than a few hundred tons you'll want to
build custom equipment for the job, but that's mostly a matter of
convenience - its more efficient than setting up large teams of comercial
bulldozers & such.  You can scale up to tens of thousands of tons before
things even start to get tricky, which is far larger than anything that the
ancients ever moved.

It might be usefull to point out here that we usually think in terms of
moving something a few thousand miles in a matter of days or weeks.  The
ancients, OTOH, were usually moving things a few dozen miles over the course
of months or years.  If you think like the ancients, those amazing feats
suddenly start seeming a lot more doable.

Again, we're pretty sure we know how they did it.  You just need a good
knowledge of naked-eye astronomy, and lots of patience and attention to
detail.

BTW - Surely you realize that in the modern world we can align a building to
essentially infinite precision?  (i.e. our instruments permit such high
precision that the thermal flexing of the building & ground will produce
much larger errors than an imprecision of our measurements)

If we moderns sat around thinking all day every day about how to
make things out of rocks, I am quite confident we could come up
with some really impressive feats.  The ancients had little else to
work with, and no video games to distract them.  I think various
commentators are correct: the ancient stone arches were approximated
and the bad ones have fallen long since.  spike

Title
  Lipoic acid reduces the activities of
  biotin-dependent carboxylases in rat liver.
Source
  Journal of Nutrition.  127(9):1776-81, 1997 Sep.
Abstract
  In the past, lipoic acid has been administered to patients
  and test animals as therapy for diabetic neuropathy and various
  intoxications. Lipoic acid and the vitamin
  biotin have structural similarities. We sought to determine
  whether the chronic administration of lipoic acid affects
  the activities of biotin-dependent carboxylases. For 28 d,
  rats received daily intraperitoneal injections of one of the following: 1) a
  small dose of lipoic acid [4.3 micromol/( kg.d)]; 2) a large
  dose of lipoic acid [15.6 micromol/(kg.d)]; or 3) a large
  dose of lipoic acid plus biotin [15.6 and
  2.0 micromol/(kg.d), respectively]. Another group received n-hexanoic
  acid [14.5 micromol/(kg.d)], which has structural
  similarities to lipoic acid and biotin and
  thus served as a control for the specificity of lipoic acid.
  A fifth group received phosphatidylcholine in saline injections and served as
  the vehicle control. The rat livers were assayed for the activities of
  acetyl-CoA carboxylase, pyruvate carboxylase, propionyl-CoA carboxylase, and
  beta-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase. Urine was analyzed for lipoic
  acid; serum was analyzed for indicators of liver damage and
  metabolic aberrations. The mean activities of pyruvate carboxylase and
  beta-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase were 28-36% lower in the lipoic
  acid-treated rats compared with vehicle controls (P < 0.05).
  Rats treated with lipoic acid plus biotin
  had normal carboxylase activities. Carboxylase activities in livers of
  n-hexanoic acid-treated rats were normal despite some
  evidence of liver injury. Propionyl-CoA carboxylase and acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase were not significantly affected by administration of lipoic
  acid. This study provides evidence consistent with the
  hypothesis that chronic administration of lipoic acid lowers
  the activities of pyruvate carboxylase and beta-methylcrotonyl-CoA
  carboxylase in vivo by competing with biotin.

  Additional note by poster:

    High dose lipoic acid is less effective than low dose in the treatment
  of diabetic neuropathy. This may be due to an induced marginal biotin
  deficiency. Megadose biotin itself has been found to be significantly 
  more effective than lipoic acid in treatment of diabetics.

Title
  Patterns of death in world leaders.
Source
  Military Medicine.  163(12):797-800, 1998 Dec.
Abstract
  This study presents an analysis of the mortality patterns of
  people who become world leaders. Using information in the public domain, we
  identified 261 world leaders who died between 1965 and 1996. Of these, 118
  died while in office, 44% violently, often by assassination. Of the 143
  leaders who died after leaving office, 11% died violently. The violent
  deaths occurred worldwide but most frequently in the Middle
  East/South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa regions. The most frequent natural
  causes of death among world leaders were heart disease,
  cancer, and stroke. Mortality patterns reveal that the
  longevity of those leaders who died of natural causes could have been
  predicted by U.S. life tables. This study suggests that world leaders are
  neither biologically "tougher" nor more vulnerable to disease than others;
  however, their odds of dying violently while in office are high.

Title
  Acetyl-L-carnitine fed to
  old rats partially restores mitochondrial function and
  ambulatory activity.
Source
  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of
  America.  95(16):9562-6, 1998 Aug 4.
Abstract
  Mitochondrial function and ambulatory activity were monitored after feeding
  old rats acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR). Young
  (3-5 mo) and old (22-28 mo) rats were given a 1.5% (wt/vol)
  solution of ALCAR in their drinking water for 1 mo, were sacrificed, and
  their liver parenchymal cells were isolated. ALCAR supplementation
  significantly reverses the age-associated decline of mitochondrial membrane
  potential, as assessed by rhodamine 123 staining. Cardiolipin, which declines
  significantly with age, is also restored. ALCAR increases cellular oxygen
  consumption, which declines with age, to the level of young rats. However,
  the oxidant production per oxygen consumed, as measured by
  2',7'-dichlorofluorescin fluorescence levels, is approximately 30% higher
  than in untreated old rats. Cellular glutathione and
  ascorbate levels were nearly 30% and 50% lower, respectively, in cells from
  ALCAR-supplemented old rats than in untreated
  old rats, further indicating that ALCAR supplementation
  might increase oxidative stress. Ambulatory activity in young and
  old rats was quantified as a general measure of metabolic
  activity. Ambulatory activity, defined as mean total distance traveled, in
  old rats is almost 3-fold lower than in
  young animals. ALCAR supplementation increases ambulatory activity
  significantly in both young and old rats, with the increase
  being larger in old rats. Thus, ALCAR supplementation to
  old rats markedly reverses the age-associated decline in
  many indices of mitochondrial function and general metabolic activity, but
  may increase oxidative stress.

  Additional note by poster:

     Low dose lipoic acid also helps reverse mitochondrial function, but
  does not increase oxidative stress, so this may be a preferable
  supplement for fragile elderly humans to try. Lipoic acid does have the
  side effect of increasing biotin requirements, so extra biotin should be
  given as well to prevent a deficiency.
     Pyruvate is another supplement that may be helpful in the elderly.

Are you sure of this? That we can move single objects over ground weighing
thousands of tons?

"think like the ancients" means "have a casual disregard for human life and the

want"    :-)

Um, please read my reply to Michael Lorry. I mean the foundations are extremely
square, edges and corners all line up, etc., to a very tiny degree of error.

Do we? I know we can, but do we? Has anyone done this in practice?  The engineer
I saw quoted said that he builds very large buildings and it would be impossible
to align an object as large as the Great Pyramid to the degree it is. Um, I
mean, make sure it is square etc. when I say align. Gah.

Nup, have a look. Large forts with walls made of rock heated until it fused into
a single block of glass.

As I recall, one gentleman in California or Oregon built a copy of the pyramid, I think at 1/2 scale, in only a few months with a crane. It used stone blocks which were more rough cut than those in Egypt, but that was a cost saving measure, so he did not fit them to the same tolerance. Precision stone cutting is very expensive these days.

Hey Michael, is it a rhetorical technique of yours to not answer what someone has written, or did you misread what I wrote?
Feel free to read the paragraph directly above your quote and then comment on it.

Such as your comment above.

Okay, maybe I didn't express myself properly.
What I meant was that the base of the pyramid is incredibly square, the edges are very straight (well, they are slightly curved, but the consistency is very accurate), etc.  I saw a program on the Pyramids on TV, and they had a civil engineer who quoted alignment accuracy figures for major building projects, and as you know most modern buildings are reasonably square, have straight edges, etc., and he (this engineer has built buildings, so he knew what he was on about) said that he had no idea how to build a building which was as well aligned (erk, terminology fails me) as the Great Pyramid using modern building techniques.

Now, I'm quoting someone who was mean to be an expert.  Please feel free to refute these comments using factual info, not opinions.


I'd personally like to think we can do better than they could, but I have yet to see any hard evidence to support this theory.



> The the surveying techniques we use today are virtually unchanged from those developed in those ancient times (with the exception of modern optics and lasers). In place of optics, peephole sights were used, which are so accurate that many snipers prefer peepholes to the modern optical scopes. Using a large scale (10' diameter) sundial, some knowledge of astronomy (of which the egyptians were without equal in that day and age), and a peephole sight mounted on a tripod, you could estimate true north with the same accuracy.

Okay, I didn't mean "aligned with north"  I meant "square, even, very accurate corners/edges/angles whatever".

If you don't know what I am referring to, please refrain from commenting.
*Obviously* I would not bring up mounds of earth in such a discussion now, would I?


No, not mounds of earth, forts made of rock which has been heated up and fused into glass.


>  Note that the Roman Republic was so adamant about the tolerances of their stone cutting that contractors only got paid 50% of a project cost until the project was still standing 40 years later.

Really? Do you have primary sources for this?  This is *such* an interesting bit of info....

I find it highly amusing that you say this after telling us that the life span of a modern building is typically 35 years   :-)

Sue, it can carry it, but do we have the technology to lift such objects?
The quote I saw said that modern engineers could not transport such an
object, I'm assuming that means lift and move.
Also, the turtle the  move the space shuttle on moves vewwy vewwy slowly,
along a very flat surface.


I'm not saying you're wrong and super-alien-beings from the past tossed big
rocks around, it's just that I have heard all sorts of theories pro and
con, but when I have read or heard any comments from people who actually
*do* have a clue, namely civil and construction engineers, they say "hell
no we can't do that!"

There's a lot of  opinions thrown around in this area, not a lot of facts,
and most of the facts are dubious.

What makes you think they had one?

I would think that any engineer who tries to move part of the Great Pyramid
or the lower course of the Temple of Jupiter would be lynched, so, um, no,
I think they were just offering their professional opinion.  I'm sure any
engineer with a modicum of self-respect would not short-sell his profession
on TV or in the pages of a published journal.

Maybe we lack the technology to move 1,000 ton blocks of stone great
distances?

Your reply fits into the "modern man can do anything the ancients could,
and better!"-meme receptors fairly well  :-)

The Space Shuttle, fully assembled, weighs somewhere around 3 or 4 million pounds (with no liquid fuel), which comes out to 2 thousand tons. The assembled shuttle is moved via a large crawler vehicle several miles in 2 days from the assembly building to the launch pad. The assembled shuttle stands over 180 feet tall. I seriously doubt that any blocks moved by the ancients outscale the Space Shuttle.

My internet access has been highly unreliable recently, but seems to be
working again right now. I have a number of excellent speakers lined up for
the Extro 4/Biotech Futures conference and will be posting some information
about progress with the event this weekend, and updating the web pages.

While I have a very strong roster of confirmed speakers for the research
presentations for the Saturday focus on human life extension, I'm still
looking for some researchers in the areas of genetic engineering, genomics,
and bioinformatics. I'm currently in contact with several possibilities,
but would greatly appreciate the help of list members in suggesting
researchers in these fields who could give a survey of the state of the art
and intelligently project future trends in the research.

Thanks,

Max

As I recall, one gentleman in California or Oregon built a copy of the pyramid, I think at 1/2 scale, in only a few months with a crane. It used stone blocks which were more rough cut than those in Egypt, but that was a cost saving measure, so he did not fit them to the same tolerance. Precision stone cutting is very expensive these days.

The point is that your unsupported assertions that these rocks are 'too massive to be moved using currently available technology' are technically baseless.  Moving any object is merely a matter of power x time. Modern engineers, when and if they say that it is 'too massive to move', are usually including in their reasoning that it is 'too massive to move' in a manner that is cost effective for the project at hand. It is far more feasible to pour your rock in situ using reinforced concrete structures than to quarry, cut, and move huge blocks of rock in the modern day. We don't move rocks like that anymore, because it is not cost effective, so there are no modern technologies used in the construction field for utilizing such large rocks. That is not to say that such technologies could not be developed if a requirement were found for such rocks that could not be met with clastic polymerization. That we don't use such old construction methods indicates the primitiveness of using such large rocks, and not any indication of 'lost' advanced technologies. Its not advanced if its not as cost effective as modern technologies.

As above, buildings are not built to be so square because it is not that necessary. Daily thermal expansion and contraction of the structure is greater than the tolerance to which you ascribe the Great Pyramid to have been built. The Egyptians built it to such tight tolerances out of religious convictions regarding the geometry of the structure, not because of technical needs.

Considering that the Egyptians calculated pi to a high accuracy for the age (out to six or seven decimal places), all that they needed to build the pyramid as square as it is purported to be are three pieces of rope or chain, representing the three sides of a 1:1:2^(1/2) triangle, calculated in lengths to the tolerance of their existing knowledge of geometry. We know they had this knowledge, because the Kings Room and the Queens Room, as well as the 'sarcaphagus' found in the Kings Room all are built with dimensions representing several of the integral ratio triangles, including the 1:2:3^(1/2), the 3:4:5, and the 1:1:2^(1/2).

> I'd personally like to think we can do better than they could, but I have yet to see any hard evidence to support this theory.

The Saturn 5 rockets were over 360 feet tall and were built to within less than 1/4 inch tolerance over the entire length. Similar tolerances are used in the construction of 1100 to 1500 foot long aircraft carriers and container ships, and even tighter tolerances were used in the construction of the super oil rig 'Hybernia'. We can build to whatever tolerances we need. What we don't need, we don't do. It saves lots of money.

In place of optics, peephole sights were used, which are so accurate that many snipers prefer peepholes to the modern optical scopes. Using a large scale (10' diameter) sundial, some knowledge of astronomy (of which the egyptians were without equal in that day and age), and a peephole sight mounted on a tripod, you could estimate true north with the same accuracy.

BUilding to tangents is not difficult. Engineers build to the tolerances needed and cost effective.

Whats so amusing about it? That the builders of the cathedral insisted on finishing a building that is 70 years out of date, when finding skilled stoneworkers is difficult and expensive, drastically increasing the cost of construction?

Let's see what AltaVista and the web brings up. On
http://www.bayltd.com/assng1.html they move around stuff weighing
several hundred tons and obviously need to get it on and off the
crawlers. Mobile tower cranes can lift at least 300 tons, combine four
and you can lift even the quarry stone. Hydraulic cranes can
apparently lift up to 500 tons.

Aha, here is an interesting piece:
http://www.jmuller.com/engineer/pubs\enr\nsc\nsc1296.htm
They mention the Svanen, a Danish crane system for bridge building
that can lift 8,200 tonnes. That is eight Trilithons (if the measures
are not confused; why can't everybody use SI! :-). They use it in this
case to move precast concrete spans a 7,500 tonnes, which are also
moved overland from a casting years to the building area.

As seen above, clearly not.

Sure. But what I was thinking of was the spreadability of a meme:
something that fits in with the schemas many people have (and the
golden age idea is *very* firmly entrenched in western civilization)
will spread much further than something that doesn't - regardless of
the validity. Actually the "modernity is better than the past" meme is
fairly weak compared to the golden age meme when it comes to popular
views, so two equivalent statements about the engineers of the past
("they could do it, we can", "they could do it, we can't") would
spread at different rates. My guess is that the claim the ancients had
wonderful stuff we have lost would spread much further without being
true, simply because it fits with cultural schemata, gives a certain
thrill ("wow! I wonder *how* they did it?") and it suits some other
meme systems well.

Well, after looking back over the archives I can see that we aren't likely
to come to a meeting of minds on this topic.  I think that property rights
are a necessary precondition of production and trade, and therefore that
abolishing copyright would lead to a precipitous decline in the production
of intellectual property.  You apparently believe that abolishing copyright
would actually lead to an increase in such production.

On the good side, at least this is a question of fact and not some
unmeasurable philosophical issue.  Unfortunately, what we really need to
settle the issue is an example of an actual modern society without copyright
laws.  AFAIK there isn't any such place, so we are left with a distressing
absence of data.

Since you apparently don't accept the arguments from economic theory, or
from historical precedent, I suppose we'll just have to continue to disagree
until someone actually performs the experiment.

Absolutely.  A single locomotive engine can haul several tens of thousands
of tons, and you can easily reach hundreds of thousands just by ganging
several of them together.  For that part of the problem it doesn't matter if
what you are moving is one big object or a collection of little ones, the
problem is the same either way.

You can load a thousand-ton rock onto a carrying platform by building a ramp
and using a couple of locomotive engines to drag it (if you want to be
sophisticated, you can lubricate the ramp or put rollers under the block to
make it move more easily).  You haul it off the platform and into position
the same way.

Note, by the way, that this is all 19th-century technology.  We could
probably scale it up quite a bit if we needed to for some reason - probably
to millions of tons, and possible to tens of millions.

Well, the part I was refferring to was "it doesn't matter if the whole
process is really slow".  Moving that block at a slow walk is good enough.

OK.  Different problem, but the answer is the same - we can shape matter to
pretty much any degree of precision you want to pay for.  Commercial
construction techniques aren't up to the job, but that is only because no
one wants to pay for that kind of precision anymore.

With scientific equipment you can easily measure off your dimensions with an
accuracy of a few millimeters, regardless of how big the structure is.
Measuring exact angles is also no big deal - telescope aiming systems
routinely point objects in a desired direction with an error of <0.1
arc-second, which is far bette than the pyramids.

If you can make the required measurements, actually building to them is just
a matter of money.  Either you spend extra time carefully placing your forms
before pouring concrete, or you come back afterwards and cut away everythig
that isn't supposed to be there.

The fact that a TV show dedicated to spreading the "ancient wonder workers"
meme was able to find someone to quote really doesn't carry much weight.
You can find *someone* who will agree with just about anything.  I believe
the Flat Earth Society has a couple of members who are engineers, too.

The important question is what the general consensus of the experts is.  I
looked into this several years ago, and what I found was that the general
consensus among archaologists is that there is no big mystery to be
explained.  In Egypt, Greece and the Middle East they've worked out exactly
how just about everything was built, and can sometimes even trace the spread
of new techniques from one culture to another across the course of
centuries.

In other, less thoroughly studied parts of the world there are still lots of
things they haven't figured out.  However, the question they ask is not "How
could this have been done?", but rather "What exact technigues allowed a few
thousand people with hand tools to complete this project in only a few
decades?"  I never found an example of structure that the experts couldn't
fiigure out how to build - and if we know what to do, actually doing it is
just a matter of spending enough money.

Yes, I too believe property rights are absolutely essential for production
and trade.  But the fundamental nature of "property" is something that
can only be used by one person at a time.  All physical property has that
nature; trademarks have that nature; stories and songs do not.  That's
not an opinion, just a simple, objective fact of nature.  Because of that
fact, it is worth examining whether or not using the same social structure
we use for excludable property makes sense for non-excludables.  Most
people merely assume it does--but that's just an assumption, and really
needs to be examined more carefully.

Our own society through most of its history is a good example.
Copyrights and patents are a very recent innovation of the last
century or two.  Even as late as the 1800s, the US did not recognize
foreign copyrights or patents (Charles Dickens' novels were often
bootlegged in the states).  Shakespeare, Milton, Chaucer; the
great artists like Da Vinci and Rembrandt; composers Mozart, Bach,
and Beethoven; all produced their works and earned their livings
without benefit of copyright.  Some countries even today still
have no such laws (India being the prime example).

I gladly accept arguments from economics and history; please present one.
The only arguments I ever hear are "Well, it's obvious that we must have..."
or "There's no way to profit without...", both of which are merely
argument by lack of imagination.  The "historical" argument I most
definitely do not accept is the meaningless "We've always done it this
way...", especially when it's not even true.

I believe the "virtrified forts" are primarily features of *Scotland*, not
Ireland (although there are a couple sites there as well). There have been
several experiments which have recreated the fusing of granite blocks using
quite simple stack-and-cook techniques. Note that the blocks are not
completely glassed - only the outer layer of the stones are fused.

Fwiw, when I was in 8th grade, our social studies/history teacher had us
build a "charcoal mound" as part of our instruction in early Colonial
American economics. It took less than a week for a few dozen 13 year olds
to cut sod and cedar wood, stack it into a mound a story high, fire it with
coal and let it smoulder and rend the wood. We watched it carefully, and
pulled off many gallons of kerosene during that time. At the end of the
smoulder, we tore down the sod, and pulled out several hundred pounds of
high-quality charcoal, which would have been suitable for firing glass -
glass making was the BIG industry in early colonial America (we sold the
charcoal and the kerosene to a local dealer to help fund our class field
trip). The stainless steel grating (used to hold the ten pounds of starter
coal), which had been approximately one meter square and made of 1cm thick
rods, was melted into a puddle of slag at the bottom of the pile; and the
rock under the pile (cntrl NJ slate and gneiss mix) was fused. Clearly, a
similar method could be adapted to fire a stone wall at high temperature.

The ancients were as smart and clever as we (perhaps more so at times), and
I have no doubt that there is knowledge and technique that we once knew,
and do not know now. But I think that stone building techniques are not
likely amongst them. Look instead to botanical and psychological lore. And
personally, I think of these less as "Lost Secrets of the Ancients!" (cue
incidental music) and more as "Poorly Recorded Trade Secrets of People Who
are Dead Now"!

One of the reasons why this argument has increasing relevence is because
of predictions that the new information technologies will allow violations
of copyright without effective enforcement being possible.

We see this already to a limited extent with the MP3, porn and "warez"
traffic, where the violators are so numerous and widespread that it has
apparently not been practical to enforce copyright.  They also are able
in many cases to shield themselves with technological anonymity strong
enough for the purpose.

Theoretically it should be possible to use cryptography to make this kind
of information trading even more secure and anonymous.  The crypto wars
are still being fought, of course, and it remains to be seen how it will
all come out, but if cryptographic anonymity is not outlawed then it will
become even easier to share copyrighted information.  This appears to be
part of the motivation for David Brin's proposal for his "transparent
society" which would not allow public forms of secrecy and anonymity,
particularly when protected by cryptography; as an author his livelihood
would be threatened if people could freely share his works.

There are countervailing technologies under development.  Fingerprinting
marks each distributed document so that if it later appears on the black
market it can be traced back to the original purchaser.  Special hardware
could sit in your computer and only allow data to be displayed if you
had the proper key.  The controversial Intel processor ID feature was
apparently intended as a step in this direction, although Intel later
tried to deny this.

I suspect that we will see occasional shifts in the balance as this
technological arms race continues.  At times the crackdowns will
be relatively successful and the illegal information traffic will be
suppressed, but at other times some new method will be found to get around
the restrictions and we will once again see widespread sharing of data.
So we may have the opportunity to witness both environments over the
next few decades, and it will be interesting to see whether there is
any impact on the rate of production of intellectual property.

You could also argue that copyright results in excessive overproduction of
intellectual property; we may have more production today than ever before,
but we certainly have more production of utter crap today than ever before.
Without copyright we'd probably lose a lot of that production... but I
strongly suspect we'd lose far more of the crap than the worthwhile 
material.

Actually it has to climb quite a steep ramp at the launch pad. Or do you
mean flat as in lack of lumps and bumps rather than gradient? It certainly
wouldn't like to roll over any rocks along the way, but the main problem
is that the shuttle would topple over, not that it couldn't do so; if it
was carrying something with a much lower center of gravity it could
probably take it over quite rough ground with those huge tracks and all
that power.

Are you referring to "Damascus steel"?  AFAIK, that has never been
duplicated, but perhaps its quality was overestimated.

Not only has it been duplicated, but there are people who can tell you where
& when a particular sample was made, and which exact technique was used.  It
was based on a moderately-sophisticated steelmaking technique that
professional metallurgists usually learn about in college, so anyone who is
really knowledgeable in the field should be able to give you all the details
you want.

Damascus steel  treatment processes were liberated long ago and have been common knowledge among blacksmiths for hundreds of years. Its also known as watered steel because of the rippled color you see from the hundreds of layers of alternating carbon densities. Gun barrels were made by a hammer forging process itilizing layered and wound case hardened wire that is an offshoot of the damascus method, and such barrels were called 'Damascus' barrels by the smiths who made them. Such barrels went out of favor with the advent of  drilled and forged solid steel and nitro powders early in this century, as damascus barrels that were not proof fired at the factory for nitro powders had a risk of bursting when fired with these more powerful gun powders, rather than the black powder they were designed for. However, once you take a damascus barrel gun, do an inductance test on it and proof fire it with a 200% charge, it is proven usable for modern charges. The barrels that would burst were ones that had internal structural flaws that could not be seen with the old methods of quality control.

There do seem to be a few 'traditional herbal remedies' that actually work,
so presumably there were others known to ancient cultures that were also
effective.  However, we should keep in mind that we usually wade through
hundreds of completely worthless folk remidies for every one that turns out
to be worthwhile.  That being the case, I'm not sure what we should say
about primitive medicine - if an Athenian physician 'knows' two hundreds
treatments unknown to the modern world, of which 199 are actually worthless
and 1 is moderately effective, should we say he knows something we don't?
Or should we say his bag of tricks is essentially worthless, but every once
in a while he happens to do something right by accident?

Hi:


I had run across Dr Flanagan. I had heard a great deal about his
neurophon. I was curious if any of you all had more information about him.
Some of this inventions seem pretty amazing, and others seem a bit
sketchy. I also had heard discussion once of a "russian sleeping machine."
I searched the web and found no information on it. Thanks for the help on
any resources that might help me better investigate. 

Here was one URL about his work:

I'm afraid the neurophon is a fraud.  The information you pointed to
contains several clear indicators of this:

1) The 'explanation' of how it works is so vague as to be meaningless.

2) It is claimed that it functions via 'telepathy', yet the author gives no
evidence in support of this extraordinary claim.  In fact, he acts as if
there were nothing unusual about it.

3) The device was supposedly covered up by the military.  Now, what possible
military necessity could lead to a hearing aid being declared classified?

4) On the same item, there is no 'Defense Intelligence Agency' - and if this
had really happened, you'd think they would give the actual name of the
agency responsible.

5) The device is supposed to have been public knowledge since at least 1994.
Somehow, I think the invention of a miraculous, universal artificial ear
would have made both the mainstream press and the medical literature by now.

6) A whole laundry list of unrelated, and improbable, benifits are claimed
for the device (including super learning, pain control and 'enhanced psychic
powers').

7) The same page refers to all sorts of unrelated pseudoscience as if it
were real.

8) The page is hosted by a site devoted to promoting into psychic phenomena,
channeling, UFOlogy, alien technology, new age spiritualism and related
topics.  While that doens't automatically mean that everything therein is
false, it does mean that any unusual claims should be viewed with the utmost
scepticism.  In light of the warning signs mentioned above, I can see no
good reason to think the neurophon story is any different from their tales
about psychic explorations of ancient Atlantean super-technology.

Hi list. My name is Chandra Patel. I'm a thirteen year old who has been 
following transhumanism and all its related subjects for a few months now. 
I'm trying to do this whole polymath thing since I think I have a fairly 
good head start. On the physics side I'm starting with Feynman's lecture 
series. If anyone has any recommendations for good introductions to 
relativity, quantum mechanics, and other topics please let me know.  The one 
problem I've noticed with the Feynman books is there are no problems to work 
through, its all lecture material.  I'm looking for good textbooks on 
physics topics.  I'm hoping people here might have a good idea where I might 
find such books. I've got a basic understanding of Calculus if that helps in 
making recommendations.

I'm also interested in sharpening my programming skills which have been 
isolated mainly to BASIC and QBASIC at this point.  What computer languages 
are best for beginning my trek toward Coding Deity status?  There seem to be 
lots of options and my teachers and friends have no ideas about where to 
start.

Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.

Chandra

In a major breakthrough in the treatment and prevention of infectious 
disease, the researchers have found a way to disarm microbial pathogens with 
the discovery of a "cloaking" device, effectively stopping them in their 
tracks in animal studies. The findings, published in the May 7 issue of the 
journal Science, will be applied toward the development of a new generation 
of vaccines and antibiotics, according to the researchers.

Umm, though I make no claims for any site's content; my understanding of
the original G. P. Flanagan Neurophone is that it induces some amount of
current into the brain, and that somehow the brain can learn to decode it
as sound. Since that development (in his early teens, I seem to recall), it
would appear that Flanagan is/was a prodigy who got weird (into pyramid
power etc.).
AFAIK,
-The neurophone was patented quite a while ago. Improvements to that patent
have been claimed, but I've never seen evidence they're for real.
-I believe you can easily verify that a military DIA does in fact exist, or
it has existed. 
-The circuits I've seen require the application of AM RF in the low 100s of
volts--*across the cranium*. I'll pass.

Suggestion: try a Dogpile search on "Russian sleep", "elektroson" and
"electronarcosis".

Soviet experimenters ballyhooed this back in the 60s. The idea was to use
electrodes fixed on the eyelids and behind the ears to induce relaxed
(correlated with alpha or theta brainwaves) states. It's possible that
there was some entrainment effect due to e.g. phosphenes (the "lights"
sometimes seen when one rubs one's eyes).

Reported results by Western researchers through around 1973 were mixed and
inconclusive.

If you need physics problems, get any edition second or later (they found 
most of the errors after the first ed) , of Haliday and Resnick's college 
Physics Text book.  A great  basis for physics, uses calclus where 
appropriate, has lots of good problems, some worked out, some with answers.  
Use Feynmann for the concepts, the way to think about physics. His lectures 
while very clear at times, are very deep.
  H &R, get the mechanics, the problems.  

As for languages, for technical stuff, C, C++ seems very useful right  now.  
Good luck.  

Right now I am reading  Greg Egan's "Diaspora" - its excellent.  At age 13, 
read physics, code C, and read science fiction also, to widen your 
imagination.

Many laws being introduced to ban human cloning, and some already on the 
statute books, have loopholes that might allow cloners to evade them. By 
Nell Boyce

Human cloning by nuclear transfer, the technique used to create Dolly, isn't 
even explicitly prohibited by Britain's 1990 Human Fertilisation and 
Embryology Act, one of the world's most thorough attempts at regulating 
human reproduction. "The law bans all kinds of cloning except for the Dolly 
technique," says Barney Wyld, a spokesman for the Human Fertilisation and 
Embryology Authority in London. However, he adds that anyone wanting to 
clone a person would have to apply to the authority for permission--which 
would be refused.

In the US, legislators have tried to ban cloning at the state and federal 
levels. California has already passed an anti-cloning law and 21 other 
states are considering bans. Seven federal bills have been proposed in 
Congress.

Lori Andrews, an expert in the legal aspects of reproduction at the 
Chicago-Kent College of Law, says that recent technological advances may 
make much of that legislation obsolete. For example, at least 11 state bills 
and California's cloning ban prohibit cloning involving the replacement of a 
human egg's nucleus with that of another human cell. But researchers in Neal 
First's laboratory at the University of Wisconsin at Madison have already 
put the DNA of primates into cows' eggs that have gone on to develop into 
early embryos (This Week, 24 January, p 5). If the same technique can 
produce normal human embryos, then these laws could be circumvented.

Other loopholes are created by poor wording. At least eight state bills 
would prohibit the cloning of a genetically identical person, but Andrews 
notes that eggs carry mitochondrial DNA in their cytoplasm--so a clone 
created by nuclear transfer would not have identical DNA.

But even an airtight law could be challenged by Americans who might claim it 
infringes their constitutional right to reproduce. "There already is an 
infertile man who is thinking of challenging the California law," says 
Andrews.

You have to wade through a lot of crap at this "Tools for Exploration" site

For an adult cell to be cloned, it must somehow be made "young" again.
How the clock of life was turned back

By Andy Coghlan and David Concar

Dolly's birth shows that the biological development of cells is not as 
irreversible as scientists once thought. To make her, Ian Wilmut and his 
colleagues had to wind back the developmental clock of an adult udder cell. 
Thanks to their manipulations, the cell obliged. Its nucleus shook off its 
"udder cell" identity and was biochemically reprogrammed to begin life all 
over again.
Such reincarnation at the genetic level goes against long-held beliefs about 
molecular biology.
As an organism grows, its cells divide and specialise by switching on 
certain genes inside their nuclei and shutting others down. It is a complex 
business involving specialised proteins that manipulate DNA and enzymes that 
chemically modify the strands with methyl groups. People assumed that genes 
were shut down for good, but Dolly's arrival appears to show that the 
process is reversible.
In pioneering experiments with frogs in the 1970s, a team led by John Gurdon 
at the University of Cambridge transplanted nuclei from the skin cells of 
adult frogs into frog eggs lacking their own nuclei. While some embryos grew 
into tadpoles, none reached adulthood.
Wilmut says the key to success lies in the unique way his team manipulates 
the cells that donate the genetic material. They starve the donor cell into 
a state of hibernation by placing it in a salt solution containing just 
enough growth factor to keep it alive. The cell stops dividing and copying 
its DNA, and shuts down all but the most vital of its genes. This seems to 
enable the nucleus-free egg to reprogram the new nucleus.
During the first few hours of development, sheep embryos are slow to 
activate genes in their nuclei. This period of "genome silence" may also 
give the egg a breathing space to reprogram the new nucleus, says Jonathan 
Slack, an embryologist at the University of Bath.
But working out the biochemistry--and limits--of this reprogramming will 
keep researchers busy for years. The new findings suggest the egg must 
contain proteins and enzymes powerful enough to remodel and repackage a 
specialised nucleus. But nobody yet knows what these molecules are, or 
whether clones could be made with any adult cells.
"Brain and muscle cells are probably so [specialised] that you can't reset 
their clocks," says Wilmut.
Another big question is whether cells from a very old donor would work. Some 
molecular changes that build up during ageing--such as random damage to 
DNA--are likely to prove impossible for an egg to reverse.

Fasten your seatbelts . . .

The news that a Californian woman who died from leukaemia a year ago will 
become a mother 'from beyond the grave' will have worried many people 
concerned about the uses to which new medical technologies are put. Yet it 
should surprise few.
Julie Garber, who was 28 when she died, had some of her eggs removed and 
fertilised by an anonymous donor before undergoing cancer treatment. Her 
grandparents claim she wanted them to find a surrogate mother for her child 
after her death, and last week a 23-year-old woman obliged.
The ethical dilemmas are myriad, and the US has been troubled by them since 
Jean and Howard Garber began advertising for a surrogate for their 
'grandchild'. Many people are horrified that advances in reproductive 
biology can allow the birth of a child whose mother has been dead for well 
over a year.
They should be prepared for worse. For what this case amply demonstrates is 
that if a technology exists that meets a biological need, somebody, 
somewhere will use it, whatever the ethical opposition -- and probably 
whatever the cost. It happened with in vitro fertilisation, today widely 
accepted.
It's now happened with the late Julie Garber's embryo. It will happen with 
human cloning -- when the technology is good enough, and the price right. 
Making the impossible possible is bound to raise difficult questions.
The benefits of biological innovation will come hand in hand with a host of 
dubious applications, against which people will demand to be protected. They 
should realise, though, that no amount of legislation can put the genie back 
in the bottle.

Atlanta Tests DNA Chip To Cut Waterborne Disease
By June Preston

ATLANTA (Reuters) - A French water management firm chose Atlanta Friday as 
the U.S. test site for a revolutionary DNA chip that can detect up to 
400,000 organisms in drinking water, a development that could dramatically 
reduce waterborne disease.

Lyonnaise des Eaux, the water division of the French conglomerate 
Suez-Lyonnaise des Eaux, said the testing period for the DNA chip would last 
up to two years.

Thierry Bourbie, president of the French company's international division, 
told Reuters the DNA technology works by matching the genetic fingerprints 
of bacteria and viruses.

``It gives genetic fingerprints that are very precise,'' he said. ``It says 
whether a microorganism is alive or dead. It will allow corrective measures 
to be taken very quickly because of the speed of its diagnosis.''

Bourbie said with current technology it takes several days to diagnose a 
waterborne virus, and it could take weeks for a complete analysis of the 
organism. With the DNA technology the time lag drops to four hours at 
one-tenth the cost.

Key to cost savings is the fact that the DNA chip measures dozens of 
organisms in a single test. With existing technology, a specific test is 
required for each microorganism.

The DNA chip holds the potential to reduce the incidence of such waterborne 
diseases as polio, guinea worm disease and amoebic dysentery.

Patricia Renaud, who heads the research department at Lyonnaise des Eaux, 
said it could also cut the risk that someone could deliberately poison a 
water supply as an act of germ warfare.

``That is precisely what it would do,'' she said.

The DNA chip was Renaud's idea. She said the surface of a chip would contain 
``the DNA we want to screen for in water.'' ''We can match up to 400,000 DNA 
sequences,'' she said.

United Water Services, the U.S. partner of Lyonnaise des Eaux, will oversee 
the test. David Sherman, United Water president, said it would take at least 
18 months before the test is completed and the technology is ready for 
commercial use.

``We're going to start implementing it in the immediate future,'' he said. 
``Based on our research, we will be able to bring this to commercial use in 
18 months to two years, once it's tested and approved by the EPA 
(Environmental Protection Agency).''

Sherman said the technology was designed for drinking water systems and not 
for recreational water sometimes consumed by the public. Last year, two 
Atlanta-area children died after being exposed to the deadly E.coli virus 
while playing in a toddler pool at a water park.

``This technology is not being cultivated for a swimming pool operation, but 
if it were used it could detect a virus in the water in four hours instead 
of days later. It would detect the water problem very quickly,'' he said.

Lyonnaise des Eaux manages water quality in 30 cities around the world, 
including Paris, Barcelona, Budapest, Casablanca, Amman, Buenos Aires, 
Jakarta, Manila and Ho Chi Minh City. It signed a 20-year contract with 
Atlanta last November.

He created Microhydrin (here's the product link)

http://www.nutribiz.com/index.html#2

Dr. Patrick Flanagan at the age of 11 designed a missile and atomic bomb 
detector - that our government classifies as "Top Secret" - and then 
incorporates it as a significant part of its defense program. By the age of 
14, he designs the Neurophone®, an electronic device that transmits sound 
from the skin directly to the brain through the nervous system, not the 
bones or ears. By the age of 18, he was named as one of the Top Ten most 
promising young scientists in America by Life Magazine.(I believe he was on 
the cover) He was part of the Gemini Space Program at NASA when he was 19, 
and at 23, he worked for the U.S. Navy as a computer designer translating 
human speech into dolphin language for the Man-Dolphin Communications 
Program. Flanagan was famous for his book Pyramid Power, about his consuming 
interest in energy and bioenergy systems of the human body. His most recent 
recognition came as he was honored as "1997 Scientist of the Year" by the 
scientific community.


Here's a Neurophone link page

<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>I have a
couple q's i would like to have cleared up. First off i would like to
know what is the ultimate goal of the post human form. I hear talk about
over population, econimic gitchs due to immortality, ect. It seems to me
that the whole point of becoming post-human is to break the limitaions of
human restriction; and there have been statements about future issues due
to transhumanism that are already human issues right now. My second q is
that of the emotion that a human experiences. What is the relevance of an
emotion in post-human form? Any info/links on emotion studys would be
great. Lastly, what are your views on the collective whole?<br>

"Dr." Patrick Flanagan is one of the world's foremost con artists.  I was
recently was sent a business proposal from one of the companies marketing
his microhydrin anti-oxidant product, so I did a little background checking.
All of his inventions are completely ridiculous, no data at all.  Flanagan
was also responsible for "Pyramid Power" back in the early 70's.
Microhydrin is a particularly disgusting fraud, it most likely causes
oxidative damage, if it does anything at all.  Flanagan's M.D. and Ph.D. are
almost assuredly self awarded, because the only paper trail that exists on
him is the Life magazine puff piece, and his collection of lies and half
truths such as the paragraph Gina posted.  Beware disinformation couched in
pseudoscientific technobabble!

Learn C, but first read a book on Pascal. There is a particular
formal language property known as "scoping" that C doesn't really
have, but that should be part of the way you think about programing.
Pascal has it. Also, if you are in an American school, the AP tests
in computer science are still based on Pascal. Most of the neat
open source code in the world (GNU, Linux, etc.) is in C. Some is in
C++, and some newer stuff is in Java, Perl, Tcl/Tk, Python, etc.,
all of which use metaphors from C.

I've lost track of all the languages I've learned since I started in
1969. After you learn C, you can easily teach yourself the latest
language du jour when you need it. Also, after you've had some fun
for a year or two, and certainly before you tackle a major project,
you should learn some software engineering: there are principles
of code construction that are more important than the particulars
of the language you are using.

     Lee Daniel Crocker.
     Let's say that a writer takes ten years of full-time writing (and undertakings connected to this, like research) to write his new book.  Full-time writing means that there is little time left for him to work to support himself while he is working on his book.  Few writers can afford taking that long to write a new book, since their accumulated money will not last that long.  A few , however, are able to live on the income from an earlier book.  If they were forced to depend on constantly being interesting enough to their would-be customers to be able to sell a newsletter for a living -- even though they hadn't published any new work in ten years -- it would probably become impossible to take that long to write a book.  To this you may reply that no writer should have to take ten years to write a book, but I fear that would make quality very much rarer than it is today (and it's rare enough as it is).  What happens when somebody is an accomplished writer but worthless as an entertainer?  Perhaps he is incapable of making a newsletter which is interesting enough for him to be able to support himself by selling subscriptions.  Perhaps he is incapable (due to mental or physical ailments, say) of sitting in a bookstore signing books.  Should he then be forced to "work for a living by singing jingles and doing bar mitzvahs" as well?  This sounds like cruel and unusual punishment.

>Is there something special
>about creative work as opposed to physical or mental labor 

     Yes.  Any human being not physically or severely mentally handicapped can do physical labour.  How many can write a book worth reading or an enjoyable symphony? 

>that
>warrants special treatment?  I don't think so.  

     Are you an egalitarian?  The term "Special treatment" seems to indicate the assumption that every other type of work is paid for in exactly the same way.  This is not the case.  People are paid in different ways depending on what type of work they perform.  For most people it is enough to be able to do one type of work, however.  It might therefore be argued that to demand that a writer should be able to perform several types of work constitutes "special treatment."  I grant you, however, that it seems unlikely that artists in the future will be able to receive the kind of money they can today, since it will become increasingly easy to obtain copies of their work without paying for it.  Unlike you, I consider that to be a less desirable situation than what is the case today.

Yup, it's classic, and it has really good problems. Be aware, however, that
while the book with both volumes in  one cover is (I think) Halliday and
Resnick, the book was originally published in two volumes, the first
of which is by Resnick and Halliday. They explain this in the preface,
but it may lead to confusion while looking for the books. The title is
"Physics."

This is interesting to me because Synder uses the term "natural," as if
non-biological augmentations are unnatural. Errrgh.

While I like the idea of triggering the brain to awaken stem cells and
repair damage, adding no new parts to the brain to enhance it is like
fixing up a old Model T Ford and keeping it really shinny while only
driving 30 miles per hour.

That depends to some extent on what kinds of programming you want to end up
doing.  It also tends to be a religious issue, so you'll probably seem some
violently different opinions from others on the list.

I'd suggest starting with a more advanced PC-based development environment.
If you want to take it slow, try learning to use Microsoft Access.  It is a
very user-friendly database program, and you can learn a lot about tables,
queries, SQL and form design by playing with the tools it gives you.  It
also lets you write Visual Basic code, which makes it a relatively painless
way to learn about event-driven programming. Eventually, however, you will
reach the point where all of the fancy wizards and interface tools seem more
of a hindrance than a help - at that point you'll want to move on to the
next step.

If you already know something about databases, you may want to jump straight
into Visual Basic programming.  VB is a surprisingly powerful tool, and it
makes a pretty good introduction to most types of modern application
programming.  I'd start with learning to design forms (using the data
control for data access), then move on to class modules, ADO, SQL, web
programming and ActiveX components (in pretty much that order).

After that, it all depends on what kind of programming you are interested
in. No matter what you do you'll want to become moderately familiar with C++
and at least one major database program (Oracle, SQL Server or Sybase).  If
you want to write device drivers, system services, graphics software or
other low-level/highly-optimized code, you'll want to become a real expert
in C++ and assembly language.  If you want to program on Unix machines,
you'll want to learn Perl and/or C++.  If you want to write business
applications, you'll need a little C++ and a lot of inside knowledge about
database programs and component-based development.  If you want to do web
programming, ask me again next year - the XML field is evolving so fast
right now that there is no way to tell how things are going to work out.

BTW, I would also suggest investing some effort in learning more general
skills, like how to design complex applications and how to plan a software
development project.  Steve McConnell has written several excellent books on
these topics (Code Complete, Rapid Development and Software Project Survival
Guide).  Ideally, you want to reach the point where you can just pick up a
new language on the fly whenever you need to, and you decide which one to
use on a project-by-project basis.

If you have more questions, or run into problems learning just about
anything, feel free to e-mail me.

Well, that seems a little more believable that this miracle-cure stuff.  Of
course, if it really worked we would expect it to have attracted a lot more
attention (and scientific analysis) by now.  Presumably either there are
serious side effects that make its use unsafe, or it doesn't actually work.

That part I believed.  The patent office tries to screen out inventions that
don't actually work, but they've never been all that successful at it.  A
lot of weird pseudoscience manages to get patented, either because the
examiner believes in it or because it looks good enough on paper to fool
him.

OOPS!  Mea cupla!  Many, many apologies.  Yes, the DIA does exist (that's
what I get for writing replies in such a hurry).  They don't do much in any
of the areas I follow, so its easy to overlook them.

Headlining May's issue of Esquire, is "The First Immortal Man."  Sounds
like a takeoff of Jim Halperin's book "The First Immortal," but not quite
such a page turner.

"We are on the verge of becoming the first species to decide its own
evolution" sounds like a line out of any extropian writings.  I don't know
the author, but he sure has been reading much of our writing, and could
even be on the extropian or transhuman list.  Are you here?

My favorite image is a guy shooting the bird at an image of death.  Cryo!
Drawing less response from me is an image of a guy having his brain replace
while a long-tongued structure (I think it was supposed to be a woman)
licks his facial cheek.   Anyway, I did like his brain being upgraded.

Articles are "Diary of an Immortal Man" by Richard Dooling, and "A World of
Immortal Men" by Edward O. Wilson.  

(Wilson wrote _Consilience_ recently which I read with great enthusiasm
until the last chapter "To What End?" where he discusses volitional
evolution and seems to favor humans remaining biological.)

Every author needs an audience.  Freely sharing an author's works
enlarges the author's audience.  Because people understand and generally
practice the principle of value for value, if they find the author's
works to be of value, they are likely to compensate the author for their
perceived value of the work, and because they can freely share the
author's work, they are likely to share it with those who will also
compensate the author and continue spreading the work.

Absolutely essential?  Are you saying that it is impossible to produce
anything or trade anything unless all involved use the concept of
property rights?  What if the people simply had enough respect for each
other that they didn't interfere with each other's production activities,
and what if they had enough respect for each other that they used the
principles of reciprocity?  Is it absolutely essential that people
believe in the fictional concept of "property rights" in order to
interact productively and peacefully?

Hello, Chandra.

I would recommend learning as much as you can about all aspects of your
world.
To facilitate this process, learn to pay as more attention to everything
in your world.
Everything you do, watch carefully; you need the feedback to learn from
your actions.
Play with everything; in doing so, you learn the physical properties of
things, and you discover many new uses for things.
Pay close attention to yourself, and learn as much as you can from
yourself.
Pay close attention to other people and learn as much as you can from
them.
Remember that every experience, no matter how minute or subtle, can teach
you something, if you are alert to the experience and if you choose to
learn.
Your mind already knows how to build on itself; allow it to do so as much
as possible.
Do not accept the idea that there are limits to your potential; your
potential is unknown, and any "limits" are simply unproven conjectures.
Never stop learning and improving yourself and your situation.
Never underestimate your own intelligence and creativity; you will
surprise yourself often.
Never give up; everything you value is worth acheiving.
Do not allow others to intimidate you because you are different; in the
end everyone will be glad for your determination to do what you feel is
good.
Teach others what you know, and they will become powerful friends.
Share your value with others; you have an endless supply, and your
generous example will teach others to do the same.
Remember that your world is created largely by the choices you and others
make; learn to make more fulfilling choices and teach others to do the
same.

Never stop learning.

- David Musick

It has been asked,

"what is the ultimate goal of the post human form?"

The ultimate goal is to be able to do anything that is possible for as
long as possible.  Since we do not fully know what is possible, it is
difficult to predict what we will become.  The best we can do now is to
keep learning what is possible and to increase our capacity for action.

What is the goal of the human form? I don't think it is useful to talk
about the goals of a species, it is much more relevant to look at the
goals of the individuals making it up. What would the goals of
posthumans be? Likely as varied compared to human goals as human goals
are compared to animal goals.

History will never end; there will never be a point where all problems
are perfectly solved and there is no need for change or alertness. All
new abilities will solve some old problems, transform others, and
introduce new problems - but I prefer a state with many possibilities
rather than a state with many limitations.

Emotions are modes of thinking, adaptations to the need of acting
differently in different situations. Many emotions are fairly useless
or destructive in the current or a posthuman setting, but can be
changed or refined into something useful (a non-physical threat
usually cannot be handled by the instinctive aggressive responses we
currently have, a rationality reflex might be much better). But I
think the need for modulation of cognition will remain, so our
posthuman selves will indeed having emotions.

Good idea. I have found that getting to learn the basics of many areas
at an early age is a big advantage. My main problem was that it was
too fun to get lost in the higher levels of the subject, making my
practically useful basic knowledge a bit spotty, but your approach
seems rather through. Good luck with it!

A good idea. A very good series.

I wonder if Misner, Thorne, Wheeler _Gravitation_ is worth reading for
you. I like it and it is a standard book, but some may have different
opinions and I'm not sure about the intro potential. Anyway, it is
likely not worth reading until you have the basic physics clear.

Like the others, I think C is worth knowing. Pascal - well, it is good
for you, but in my opinion it tastes bad :-) Once you understand C, I
would suggest going directly to Java, C++ is in my opinion a bit too
messy.

I would like to mention Lisp and its successors like Scheme. Fairly
simple to learn, a very different approach to programming (functional
instead of imperative) and maybe a good complement to C in maturing as
a coding deity. 

I learned programming by writing a lot of basic and making all the
mistakes; it was nice to see that more modern languages had found ways
(functions, scoping, object oriented programming) that solved them but
I knew I had roughly had the same ideas on my own (just been unable to
do them in basic). Programming skill is really about programming a
lot, making mistakes, learning to discover them and gradually learn
how to write code so that they don't occur.

Any interest in neuroscience? In that case I can recommend Kalat's
_Biological Psychology_

And do read science fiction.

Hey, I've been a hotline user from the start, and it's good to see an
Extropian server out there... I'm on it right now, and I'm loving what I
see - Amon Tobin is good for a start!  A nice selection of music,  I'd
love to contribute to your server... I'm wondering though, is it simply a
file server or are there ever any chats/debates/conversations/etc?

I highly suggest Hotline to any Mac/PC users, and especially recommend
Amon Tobin's CD Permutation - Track 5, Nightlife... it's been a favorite
of mine for awhile.  Fits the discordian mood.

The utility in defining the goals of a species relates to how it helps us
understand the epigenetic rules associated with biological evolution.
Comprehending these rules would allow further insight into mechanisms which
would then make possible the actualization of posthumanity.

An important aspect of this centers on what E. O. Wilson refers to as
"gene-culture coevolution" conceived of by Charles J. Lumsden and himself in
_Genes, Mind, and Culture: The Coevolutionary Process_, 1981 and _Promethean
Fire_, 1983 -- with early help from Robert Boyd, Peter J. Richerson, Mark W.
Feldman, L. Luca Cavalli-Sforza, William H. Durham, Kevin N. Laland, and
François Nielsen.

What this allows us to extrapolate concerning the "ultimate goals" of
posthumans remains nevertheless theoretical, if not altogether speculative,
because we assume that posthumans could manipulate epigenetic rules to suit
themselves (as humans cannot). In general, notwithstanding this disclaimer,
we can say that posthumans will extend the range of control and complexity
that life has in the universe.

Ultimately, having completed and perfected the Theory of Everything,
posthumans could for the first time in history allow life to break with its
biological imperatives, to act independently of instinct, and to devise a
culture beyond politicality and religiosity. In this respect, I correlate
posthumans to buddhas, to entities functioning in an expanded universe of
knowledge discovered by themselves when they leave behind them instincts and
genetic predisposition, when they surpass the congenitally mystic
aberrations of tribalism, shamanism, spiritism, and especially nationalism,
to liberate their innate intelligence.

Then again, history may never stop repeating itself, a là Nietzsche's
"eternal recurrence."

Meanwhile, the majority of people seem to need to keep on sleeping in
organized belief systems more than they feel a "need for change or
alertness." The first posthuman will constitute a minority of one, and may
suffer persecution (or even execution) similar to that of other minorities
of one. As several here have pointed out before, we just don't (can't) know.

Yes, indeed. Emotions link the senses to the intellect. Don't leave home
without 'em.

I would recommend learning Java *first*.  Java is probably the
best-designed language around right now, and the one that will start out
by teaching you the right programming ideas.  Reading a Perl book, and
paying particular attention to all the arcane features, is an excellent
introduction to Old High Hackerdom, meaning Unix and whatnot; also, Perl
is the present language of the Web - although Java servlets are coming
up fast.  If you want to write actual GUI applications, or anything fast
and smooth, there's basically no choice but to use C++.

I would also recommend looking at at least one LISP dialect - Scheme is
the most beautiful, although Common Lisp is what gets used for actually
programming things.  Other programming languages that are interesting
include Haskell, BETA, APL, MOO, and Eiffel; but, like Scheme, they're
languages you learn for the concepts and not because you can actually do
anything with them.

I strongly advise not learning how to program in plain C at all - like
COBOL, BASIC, and Pascal, the language teaches bad habits.  If you can,
start out with a GUI compiler - a command-line system may be slightly
more powerful but it's a bloody pain in the neck.  Like assembly
language, command-line systems are a dark, high power from the dawn of
computing, which only the pure of heart may touch without harm.

BTW, you do have a choice of operating system, whether you know it or
not.  If you want to develop GUI apps with C++, and you don't care about
the size of the market, develop for BeOS.  If you have a non-G3
Macintosh or Wintel system, you can almost certainly install the BeOS
operating system in a separate hard-drive partition.  BeOS only costs
$69.95, includes a complete GUI compiler (most places you can't even buy
a GUI compiler for less than $300), and is by far the easiest and best
operating system to program for.

Ah, to be 13 again, and have a chance to study all the things I missed
with a working brain!  Don't forget to study cognitive science, too. 
Above all else, get some exposure to evolutionary psychology.  Not full
time, *yet* - if you want to learn the mental disciplines of
rationality, the best time is 15-17, but it's a good idea to get used to
playing with your mind before then.  At 19, I know the next step to
take, but I haven't been able to do it - if I were 16, it would have
taken me a month tops.  Over the hill.  Sigh.

To make it clear which parts I *know* and which parts I *believe*:

At the dawn of time, I typed in extremely simple programs in Basic and
Logo.  At about nine, I think, I wrote a few simple programs in
Hypertalk.  I don't count any of this as "learning to program".

I learned to program in MOO (text-based virtual reality,
object-oriented, secure, interpreted, cooperative environment), and I've
got around a year of experience in that.  Then, I wrote my first GUI
program in C, because it had to run in 32K - don't do anything like this
if you can help it!  Then, I got six months worth of Java.  Then I
started on C++.  My highest level of expertise is in C++, a few years
worth; I can do the possible elegantly and the impossible via black magic.

I can do a little Javascript and CGI.
I can read programs in Perl and Common Lisp.

Haskell, BETA, APL, Eiffel, and Scheme - theoretical knowledge only, but
they're still fascinating.

The only OS I presently have any experience is the Macintosh, but I've
fallen in love with BeOS and I intend to switch over as soon as I can
back up my computer.  It's easy to see that BeOS is infinitely superior.
 I don't have any actual experience, but it's utterly obvious that BeOS
is The Right Thing, the OS I've always wished I had, and I can't wait to
get started.  (Sound irrational to you?  Take a look at BeOS.)  As far
as I know, it's the only object-oriented operating system.

"seems to favor humans remaining biological"?

Hmmm... I rather got the impression he favors humans becoming consilient,
i.e. unifying knowledge into a Theory of Everything that explains existence
at every level. This neither prevents us remaining biological (or
psychological, or political, or neurological, etc.), nor does it favor us
remaining anything whatever at the expense of anything else.

If humans remain non-consilient, who cares if they live forever? I mean, who
wants to stay unenlightened for all time? Do you think humans can transcend
biology, achieve immortality, and thereafter eternally fail to discover
consilience? Will the post-Singularity Powers allow that?

"How can we do anything, set any goals, without knowing the Meaning of Life?
How can we justify our continued participation in the rat race if we don't
know why we're running? What's it all for?"
--Eliezer S. Yudkowsky

I don't think Wilson so much "favors" humans remaining biological, as he
considers it a necessary fact that we need to recognize and acknowledge. In
a similar fashion, Buckminster Fuller said, "Don't change mankind. Change
the environment." Why? Because if you change mankind, the new mankind may
not have the ability to change back in case it needs to return to its former
self -- to reboot the system, IOW. In contrast, if we change the
environment, a new form of humanity can evolve coincident with Homo Sapiens
_or_ Homo Sapiens can decide to restore the previous environment.
(Near-Stone Age tribes living in rain forests provide some insurance that
Homo sapiens may survive in case civilization catastrophically collapses.)

The Jekyll and Hyde story offers a metaphorical lesson: Once Dr. Jekyll
changes himself, he loses control and Mr. Hyde takes over... And Mr. Hyde
has no interest in nor ability to make a potion quickly returning him to the
Dr. Jekyll entity. So, if humans sever their ties with biology, and then
something goes wrong (as it always does), the new posthuman techno-species
will have no recourse, having burned its bridges behind itself. (The phrase
"up the creek without a paddle" seems apropos here.)

"The consilience argument can be distilled as follows: The two frontiers are
the same." (p.267)

As part of the environment, Homo Sapiens deserves conservation as much as
does the mountain gorilla or the panda bear. But in our case, we have to do
it for ourselves (despite science fiction about Powers).

If humans attain immortality via non-biological means, then it no longer
makes sense to call them human. Then they have died and gone to posthuman
afterlife.

Again, I don't think Wilson favors remaining biological; he rather favors
comprehending the unity of knowledge, after which biology will take on a
deeper, richer meaning.

Cheers,

--J. R.

_The Matrix_ revisited:  Why are we such fans?

I was speaking to a friend lately, a big movie aficionado.  He didn't
like the Matrix and couldn't understand why one of the most brilliant
people he knew (this friend is semi-mundane, so that doesn't count as
boasting - not on this list!) would be infatuated with a movie with a
bad plot, no characterization, no meaning that wasn't shoved down our
throat, and what he called "a sell-out of the intellectual concept in
favor of shoot-em-ups".

I started out by explaining that we all liked the Matrix because it was
what we had all wanted to do ourselves - walk up a wall, punch through
bricks, and so on.  The characters didn't *need* deep emotional lives
for us to sympathize with them; we *wanted* to be in their shoes.  "Ah,"
he said, "fantasy fulfillment".  Well, I didn't see what was wrong with
that (it's a perfectly legitimate form), but it still didn't quite seem
to cover the fanatic devotion on the part of people who had never cared
about a movie before.  (I hadn't.)  And eventually I came up with this.

** SPOILERS **

I think that the Matrix is a transhumanist movie in the original,
highest sense.  Technically AIs are the enemy, but the movie isn't about
"humans against machines".  It's "humans against reality".  The free
humans aren't fighting to *preserve* the world we know, as in all the
bad anti-machine movies; they're fighting to *break* it.  They're
fighting to break the limits.  _The Matrix_ takes our world of 1999 and
says, "This isn't life you're living!  This is a prison!"

It's that concept that lies at the core of transhumanism.  And the
characters in _The Matrix_ don't just believe this, they aren't just
warriors for our cause - they *embody* it.  They can kick through walls.
 They can take blows that would punch straight through an ordinary
human.  They can run up walls.  They can do all that, not because they
believe in the Force, but because they *don't* believe in our world. 
They serve and represent our ideal, that knowledge breaks limits, that
technology breaks reality. 

Who cares about Superman?  Who cares about Luke Skywalker?  They're just
guys with slightly less restrictive limits, and they have the power
because of "magic".  Most special-effects movie heroes get that way
because of "magic" - and that *is* pure wish-fulfillment.  In _The
Matrix_, the powers are explained, and it's an explanation we can all
believe in.  Especially we transhumanists - we know that our limited
reality is true, but we don't accept it.  We don't *believe* in reality,
we aren't emotionally invested.  And that's why we believe in _The Matrix_.

The AIs in the movie don't represent The Evils of Mechanization.  They
represent Life as We Know It.  The AIs represent humanity - the way *we*
use "humanity", as a set of hated limits, "only human", something to
overcome.  For all the movie's surface Frankensteineity, at heart it
truly is technophilic.  The good guys are fighting back with high
technology as well, and the message is world-breaking change, not
nostalgia and mysticism.  Maybe the movie doesn't do a good job of
preparing folks for the concept of AI, but I think it will do an
excellent job of preparing them for the concept of Singularity.

And that's why we call _The Matrix_ a transhumanistic film.

	I am deeply angry that no one has noticed me and what I have to offer to
the world.  I am deeply angry that no one cared enough about me as an
individual to ever ask me if I wanted to do what they forced me to do.  I
am deeply angry that no one wanted to listen to what I had to say.
	I feel like the people around me have abandoned me and left me to fend
for myself.  I wonder why people thought so poorly of me that they didn't
think that what I thought mattered enough to ask and mattered enough to
listen.
	I see now that many people feel this way, and I wonder why we continue
ignoring each other.  Everyone seems so scared of each other, and I
wonder why we continue being so cruel to each other.  I see many talented
people who are ignored, and I wonder why we care so little of the value
they have to offer to the world that they remain unsupported and their
talent is wasted.
	I am deeply angry at those who demand obedience and conformity.  I am
deeply angry at those who demand that I sacrifice my own happiness to
accomplish their goals.
	I am deeply angry because I was raised by an angry society.  I was
raised by a society that consistently chooses violence when they could
choose peace.  I was raised by a society which consistently chooses to
maintain conflicts between individuals when they could choose to resolve
all conflicts.
	I am deeply angry because people continue traditions of dominance and
violence.  I am deeply angry at those who use fear and guilt to control
others.  I am deeply angry at those who hurt others.
	I am deeply angry at those who have allowed the violence and abuse to
continue for thousands of years because they were too afraid to oppose
it.  I am deeply angry at those who are obedient and subservient and who
do not oppose those who cause suffering.
	I am deeply angry at myself for allowing others to hurt me.  I am deeply
angry at myself for being afraid of others.  I am deeply angry at myself
for consistently sacrificing my own happiness because of my fear that
others will hurt me for being different.  
	I am deeply angry at those who have no respect for others, and I am
deeply angry at those who have no respect for themselves.
	I am deeply angry at all that I think is wrong in the world, and I want
things to be different, to be better.

	I want to live in a world where every individual is respected.  I want
to live among people who value each other and pay attention to each
other.  I want to live among people who enjoy living together.  I want to
live among people who are intelligent and creative and who share their
value with each other.  
	I want to live among people who are not afraid of each other.   I want
to live among people who don't use guilt and fear to control each other. 
I want to live among people who allow each other to choose their own way
of living.  I want to live among people who choose to live peacefully
with each other.  I want to live among people who choose to help each
other.
	I want to live among people who value each other and who seek to be of
greater value to each other.  I want to live among people who explore
their own and each other's potential.  I want to live among people who
share their knowledge and skills with each other.  I want to live among
people who enjoy living and who share their enjoyment with others.  I
want to live among people who teach each other how to be happy.

	I want to live in a world where I am valued as an individual, where
people care what I think and what I want.  I want to live in a world
where I am valued as an individual, where I am allowed to be different
and explore my own ways of doing things.  I want to live in a world where
everyone is valued and cared for.

	Because such a world is the result of our choices, people can make the
choice to live in that sort of world.  To choose such a world, we must
simply choose to have respect for others and have an interest in other's
lives.
	We can help people develop their talents and skills so they become more
valuable to themselves and others.  We can help people learn to solve
problems well and to make good decisions for themselves.  People can be
taught valuable thinking skills and learn to use their minds to improve
their own lives.
	People can be supported financially and educationally until they can
support themselves and then be capable of helping others.  People can be
recognized as the valuable assets that they are, and people can be taught
how to increase their value, to themselves and to others.

	We can choose to live in the world we want.  By being kind, we choose to
live in a world where people are kind.  By caring for others, we choose
to live in a world where people are cared for.  By valuing others, we
choose to live in a world where people are valued.  By respecting others,
we choose to live in a world where people have respect for each other.
	By not hurting others, we choose to live in a world where people are not
hurt by others.  By allowing others to develop their own ways of living,
we choose to live in a world where people are not forced against their
will.
	By teaching each other, we choose to live in a world where people have
knowledge and skills.  By helping each other develop our talents, we
choose to live in a world of talented people.  By helping each other
prosper, we choose to live in a world of prosperity.
	Because we can learn from each other, we can learn to choose a world we
would all rather live in.

So then you are saying that the 19 year old mind is less capable than
the 16 year old mind?
Sorry, but I disagree. What evidence do you have of this?

ORANGES THAT BROADCAST
How could we live today without those ubiquitous bar codes on everything 
from soup cans to traffic tickets! Now, some work being done by Motorola 
could put those trusty bar codes in the history books. A new kind of 
microchip being developed combines enough memory to store 110 characters 
with a radio antenna - all the size of a single coffee ground.  This very 
microchip can be stuck or manufactured to just about anything. Besides more 
room for the product name, price, coupons, and so on - the chip can use its 
built-in antenna to transmit this information about of the product it's 
stuck to. That means no more waiting in line to check out at the grocery 
store - you'd just walk through the checkout station and a radio receiver 
would tally up what's in your cart. And since you can store data in the chip 
too, imagine an amusement park ticket that gets updated each time you go on 
a ride - and you just pay the total on the way out.

The first product to have a UPC bar code on its packaging was Wrigley's gum.

BIONIC EYES
Your eye doctor might be offering more than contacts in the future - you 
might be ordering a bionic eye soon.  Now don't worry, the idea that cyborgs 
will be wandering around is a ways off yet - but that far.  Up 'til now, the 
technology wasn't there, and neither was the neuroscience. But now most of 
the research is complete and it's moving quickly into corporate R&D. The 
human body is basically a large electric machine- one that researchers say 
they may be able to repair with electronic hardware. In some cases, they 
already can: The first device to restore a human sense, the ear implant, has 
been combatting deafness since the 70s. Today, more than 25,000 people have 
these bionic ears. And the eye is next. Two startup companies - one in 
Illinois and the other in Germany - have already formed to commercialize 
artificial retina designs.

It is impossible to sneeze and keep ones eye's open at the same time.

LETTING YOUR BRAIN'S GUARD DOWN
It's got a simple name - P97 - but to researchers at one Vancouver Canada 
biotech firm, this special blood protein could change the way we use drugs 
in the future. The brain has a very selective barrier protecting it, and 
only molecules that are actively transported across this barrier can enter 
the brain. Needless to say, with the barrier turning away most molecules at 
the door, this makes the delivery of drugs from blood to brain quite a 
challenge. But Synapse Technologies (http://www.synapse-tech.com) believes 
its research might hold a key.  From its labs on the UBC campus, it's been 
working on P97 to train it to deliver drugs across that protective brain 
barrier with more success. Down the road, it could spell the end to 
overdosing the body with toxic drugs just to get a bit to the brain, 
something cancer patients and other seriously ill people have to cope with.

The average brain comprises 2 percent of a person's total body weight. yet 
it requires 25 percent of all oxygen used by the body, as opposed to 12 
percent used by the kidneys and 7 percent by the heart.

RUBBER STAMP COMPUTER MAKING
Those fun rubber stamp stores for kids might soon have junion building their 
own microchips, thanks to a technology quietly in development at Lucent.  
It's working on a way to use silicone rubber stamps to print computer 
circuits on flexible plastics, curved surfaces, and, some day, even special 
clothing fibres.  The technique uses a rubber stamp (made of the same 
silicon gel today's rubber stamps use) to essentially "print" the circuit 
pattern on whatever surface is being used as the base.  {PC Week}

Rubber is one of the ingredients of bubble gum. It is the substance that 
allows the chewer to blow a bubble.

AIRCAR TAKES THE ROAD
Think the car of the future is electrical?  How about if the car were to use 
nothing but AIR to propel itself.  One French company has developed just 
such a car.  The company is led by an expert in making engines for 
lightweight aircraft and Formula One racing cars.  To power the pistons, the 
two-cylinder motor uses headed outside air and super-compressed air from 
tanks stored under the car.  The Mexican government has 40,000 cars on order 
to build a taxi fleet.  It takes about three minutes to "fill up" at a tire 
pump and you can get about 120 miles to the tankful.  They'll be released 
next year with a price tag of $13,000.  {Wired Magazine, May 1999}

TODBIT: Cars produce about four times their own weight in carbon dioxide 
each year. The average home produces 50 tons of carbon dioxide each year.

MAX SMART, STEP OFF!
Your next shoe might have a microchip in the heel.  A smart shoe prototype 
has been developed by MIT that automatically senses the wearer's cushioning 
needs by adjusting fluid in five bladders in the sole.  A microchip in the 
heel monitors pressure on the bladders, adjusting pressure on the fly -- 
more cushioning for running, less for walking.

Did you ever wonder what the WD in WD-40 stands for? WD is an abbreviation 
for Water Displacer 40th attempt.

INTERNET IN YOUR KITCHEN
In my kitchen, I've got one of those under-the-cabinet SpaceMaker toasters 
but I've always thought that would be a great place to have a flip-down TV.  
Well now, for only $2200 (ouch) I can.  CMI Worldwide of Seattle have come 
out with a flipdown flat panel screen that is a TV and a full Internet 
kiosk.  You can either watch broadcast TV through a cable port in the back, 
or hook up a security camera to watch your kids in the back yard.  All while 
making nachos.

TOMORROW'S PARKING METER TO STOP SCAMMING
You won't be getting away with quick unpaid stops at the parking meter 
anymore - not if Fred Mitchell has his way. The Canadian inventor has 
developed a new meter that can nab drivers that try to avoid paying for 
parking.  The meter is equipped with a digital camera - the camera, in turn, 
is connected to a cell phone.  When a car pulls into the parking spot, the 
meter knows - and waits for the driver to pay.  If no cash shows up within a 
minute or two, the meter snaps a picture of the car's license plate, and 
transmits it to a central office where a ticket is printed. And worse, no 
more using other people's meter time.  The meter can tell when a car leaves, 
and wipes any unused time to zero.

Kilts are not native to Scotland. They originated in France.
PLASTIC TO REPLACE SILICON IN SCREENS?
Next time you feel like throwing your laptop out a five-storey window well, 
go ahead!  Maybe not yet.. but in five years it's expected a new type of 
laptop screen could make your computer much more resilient. The transistors 
in today's laptop screens are made of silicon - which, while bright and 
colourful, might not exactly be the toughest material in the world. Now, 
researchers at IBM have developed a way to make the same transistors used in 
LCD screens out of ordinary plastic.  Better yet - they'll be cheaper to 
make and cost less. And it's not just computer screens - one cell phone 
manufacturer says it's managed to keep electrical properties in plastic 
meaning you might not need a battery at all - you'd just recharge the casing 
of your phone in the future.

SPEND, SPEND, SPEND!
There's a whole lot of money coming down the pipe for e-commerce - and you 
can thank the year 2000 bug for it. Next year will be a huge year for 
companies moving into e-business - everything from moving their supply chain 
online to providing services over the Internet. Why?  It's all because 
computer systems managers in medium- and large-sized companies will have 
their IT budgets freed up.  You see, until now most of their budgets have 
been bled dry by getting their computers ready for the turn of the century. 
In fact, it's been like that for a couple of years. In those years, 
significant improvements have been made in electronic commerce, customer 
relationship management, and data warehousing.

Camel's-hair brushes are not made of camel's hair. They were invented by a 
man named Mr. Camel.

CHURCHES SEE THE DIGILIGHT
It had to happen sooner or later... your church may be going high-tech in 
the future. It's happening already in Stuttgart, where parishioners who turn 
up to church without any cash handy for the collection need only insert 
their smart card into a special bank machine at the back.  The machine 
withdraws the donation, or offers to calculate an appropriate tithe. So far, 
it's a boon for the church - donations are up more than 20 per cent most of 
it because each heavenly transaction spits out a tax receipt - something the 
donation plate doesn't provide. And the church also likes the fact they 
don't have to spend an hour counting change after each service.

WIND-UP LAPTOPS
You've probably been there - in a plane, trying desperately to coax those 
previous last few seconds of battery juice out of your laptop computer. Well 
in the future, you might be able to just wind your laptop up to get more 
power. Freeplay, a U.S. company is said to be quietly in talks with GE to 
develop a combination wind-up and solar-power pack for notebooks.  And this 
isn't too far down the pipe - you can expect announcements some time next 
year.  They've got history behind them - Freeplay is the company that is 
putting wind-up radios in developing countries.  No word yet how much 
cranking you'll have to do per email message or spreadsheet calculation, but 
they're looking into how easy it would be to marry the crank with an "ultra 
capacitor" - a new kind of storage device that retains its charge far longer 
than batteries.  Even today's early prototypes can be charged and discharged 
millions of times, compared to just a few hundred cycles for traditional 
batteries.

I'm new to the list, and just found "transhumanism," (now
I have a name for what I believe) so I hope I'm not breaking
"protocol," however, I too loved _The Matrix_!  However, I
saw it a little differently.  

The characters were interacting in a Virtual Reality created
by a computer program, therefore, what the "body/mind"
believed became true in the program.  True, taking our
reality and accepting the limits is the same, because it all
comes from our consciousness, our "withinness."  We only
know something if we become conscious of it, and if we alter
that consciousness, it alters the reality (remember the
spoon?)

Great stuff this list, this movie.  I hear rumors that the
"brothers" are planning on doing the other two that make up
the trilogy.  I wonder if they'll do a part one pre-AI and a
part three post-neo?  I could see a lot of fun with the next
two.  

Don't forget Star Wars Espisode 1 is opening May 19th!  And
even the Force will only assist if you become aware of it
and focus its full potential.

Bzzzzt!  I didn't say "hauling" I said "moving"


your railway example requires vast amounts of infrastructure before it
will move
an inch.


I'll pose the question again: can we easily move monolithic chunks of
rock
weighing thousands of tons?
In fact, I'll be specific: could we move the lower courses of the temple
of
Jupiter at Baalbek to, say, Rome?

Now, do you know this for a fact? That this is how it would be done? I'm

thinking your rock can't flex a lot, so what about the bit where it goes
from
the inclined plane of the ramp to the horizontal plane of the carriage?
Won't it
crack?


I'm not being contrary, I just want to make sure that we are dealing
with known
engineering principles here, not lots of people playing "I think" games
based on
spurious theories of modern capability.

I'm not aware of how we could lift a million-ton object.
You haven't suggested how we could lift a thousand ton object?  Anyone
know what
the carrying capacity of the largest crane in the world is?

Aha.  So it is a cost factor, not a doability factor.

Right. Hmmmm. So maybe this engineer was a tame engineer quoted to make
the
ancients look mysterious.
Hmmm.

Um. So much for that bright idea.
I realise that you can get talking heads to say anything, but I would
assume
that a show which is trying to convince people of dubious stuff would
make extra
effort to get qualified talking heads.

Mind you, archaeologists will frequently come up with explanations which
defy
rational analysis should you actually try to attempt what they are
saying, as
they have a professional abhorrence of the "we have no idea" response.

While no two humans are exactly the same, we are all of one race, the human
race, and we all share the experience of life in an essentially identical carbon
based life form structure. We all work for continuing survival while in this
structure, and hope for a happy, safe, and good life for ourselves and loved
ones. Since everyone has a common desire for the best life attainable, we should
jointly try to achieve the same.

In a world without copyright, that would be a pretty stupid thing to do,
wouldn't it?  Why is that fact necessarily a bad thing?  Do we only want
the kinds of books that are created in the dark over long periods by
people with nothing else to do, or do we want books written by people
who understand life because they have to actually have one while they
are writing?

Here we simply disagree.  There are fewer /good/ writers than there are
/ordinary/ laborers, but fine craftsmen, master sportsmen, and similarly
talented workers in other fields are just as rare and precious.  And
writers of crap as just as numerous as unskilled laborers.

No, I am not.  Value is created by demand, and people are paid based on
how much their work is in demand.  This in no way implies that some
types of work deserve market protection while others do not.

(If I put the capitalization in the right places.)

Since I have extremely limited time for seeing movies or other
entertainment right now, I thought I'd ask for opinion's on Cronenberg's
movie eXistenZ. From what I hear, it involves Phillip K. Dick style ideas
about "what is reality" and might be of interest from an extropian angle.
Has anyone seen it? Does it contain ideas worth going to see? Is it
stylistically excellent (like Matrix)?

VR movies seem to be all the rage. The Thirteenth Floor looks weak from the
preview, but any info on that one would also be good to hear.

SUBJECT: Fifth Amendment vs. Tax Returns

BY: Dan Meador (May 6, 1999)

[Comments by Frederick Mann]


Lindsey Springer appears to have found an effective defense where tax
returns are concerned -- the Fifth Amendment prevails over the mandate
to sign returns under penalties of perjury.

At a meeting held in Tulsa the evening of Tuesday, May 4, Springer
distributed a short paragraph people should provide to anyone asking
them to file State or Federal income tax returns, the paragraph
supposedly constructed by an attorney in the Department of Justice:

"If you are suggesting that I am required to submit a signed Federal or
State Income Tax Return, and that failure to do so results in Civil and
Criminal violations of the law, I wish to inform you that the reason I
did not nor will not sign and submit such returns, is based solely on
the exercise of protection the Fifth Amendment provides me in situations
like this. The Fifth Amendment prohibits you from compelling me to give
testimony or to submit any evidence which could be used against me in a
criminal proceeding. Since the Federal and State Income Tax Returns
require a valid signature attesting under the penalties of perjury, I
respectfully decline to be compelled or volunteer to give such testimony
or evidence."

[I would amend the above as follows:
"If you are suggesting that I am required to submit a signed Federal or
State Income Tax Return, and that failure to do so results in Civil and/or
Criminal violations of the law, I wish to inform you that the reason I
did not nor will not sign and submit such returns, is based partially on
the exercise of protection the Fifth Amendment provides me in situations
like this. The Fifth Amendment prohibits you from compelling me to give
testimony or to submit any evidence which could be used against me in a
civil or criminal proceeding. Since the Federal and State Income Tax
Returns require a valid signature attesting under the penalties of perjury,
I respectfully decline to be compelled or volunteer to give such testimony
or evidence."
(I would leave the door open to later use other lines of defense as well.
I also made other changes. For details of 5th Amendment protection related
to civil proceedings, see 'Compulsory Production of Documents' by
Larry Becraft <http://fly.hiwaay.net/~becraft/Compulsory.htm>.)]

For the last several years, Springer, based in Tulsa, has assisted with
several class action suits against the Internal Revenue Service in
Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and elsewhere. As others dedicated to tax
reform and forcing the Internal Revenue Service to comply with law,
Springer has confronted every conceivable evasive Department of Justice
and Federal court tactic imaginable. The break came on a most
conspicuous issue, the Fifth Amendment clause protection which
stipulates, "[No person shall] ... be compelled in any criminal case to
be a witness against himself..."

Enlightenment, so far as clarifying the matter, came in a Springfield,
Illinois case where Clyde LaRue refused to provide a handwriting sample
for a grand jury convened by the United States District Court for the
Central District of Illinois (Misc. No. 99-06, In the Matter of December
1998 Grand Jury: Subpoena to Clyde LaRue). In the motion to compel LaRue
to produce the handwriting sampler (exemplars), the U.S. Attorney and
his assistant cited Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263 (1967), and
United States v. Euge, 444 U.S. 707 (1980), to distinguish between what
the government can or cannot compel. In sum, per the Gilbert decision,
the Fifth Amendment protection against forcing someone to testify
against himself does not extend to a mere handwriting sample, but does
to "testimonial evidence protected by the Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination."

In a manner of speaking, whatever lights went out in Georgia in 1965
came on in Illinois in 1999. Springer recognized the substance of the
two cited opinions relative to income tax returns, and was of a mind to
share his revelation with the Department of Justice.

State and Federal tax return forms require those who complete and file
them to sign under penalties of perjury. Content of the forms is
testimonial in nature, and anyone who signs under penalties of perjury
invites civil and criminal prosecution, general inquiries into private
affairs, statutory penalties, fines, and other unpleasantries too
numerous to mention. The conflict between the constitutionally secured
right and statutory law effectively aborts compelling testimony without
a grant of immunity, which only courts have power to grant, so
administrative agencies such as IRS are up the proverbial creek without
a paddle when someone refuses to file a form by claiming the
constitutionally secured right not to testify against himself.

According to Springer, the Department of Justice will resist concessions
so far as class action settlements are concerned, but outside judicial
forum (off the record, wouldnt you know), conceded the Catch 22
predicament relative to compelling testimony on income tax returns.
Constitutionally secured rights are antecedent and superior to the
governments interest, and no penalty can ensue, regardless of nature,
when the right is exercised by someone entitled to it. Whatever
liability the government establishes must be independently secured.

Federal governments nemesis is in section 7206 of the Internal Revenue
Code: "Any person who willfully makes and subscribes any return,
statement, or other document, which contains or is verified by a written
declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury, and which he
does not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter, ...
shall be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined
... or imprisoned..."

Whether implied or actual, the  pontential for criminal liability is a
clear and present danger to anyone who signs State and Federal income
tax returns under penalties of perjury. Consequently, so long as tax
return forms require signatures under penalties of perjury, the
constitutionally secured right not to provide testimony that might be
self-incriminating nulliifes willful failure to file penalties. In a
manner of speaking, this leaves the Internal Revenue Service and
corresponding State agencies in the position of trains on a track that
doesnt have a depot at either end.

The Springer breakthrough comes at a particularly opportune time as
other researchers and tax reform proponents are rapidly unraveling and
exposing Internal Revenue Code and Internal Revenue Service fraud that
has been perpetrated against the American people for most of six
decades. Among other things, the Fifth Amendment protection secures
defensive ground necessary to accumulate evidence of fraudulent and
injurious initiatives by unscrupulous Internal Revenue Service and
government officers and employees.

MEADOR ADDITION

Yes, I know Bill has hammered IRS on the Fifth Amendment issue, and as I've
responded privately to others on this matter, other people are effectively
using it, too. For example, Marcea Doerr from Sacramento uses the Fifth
Amendment in administrative forums -- never gives up books and records.

Don Beadles of Alva, Oklahoma has about the best approach I've heard of,
and it makes no difference if it is with IRS, the FBI or whoever. He asks,
"Are you a committing magistrate?"

The response is invariably, "A what?"

Don then says, "If you don't know what it is, you aren't one, so you don't
have authority to grant immunity. Consequently, I don't have to tell or give
you anything."

They vanish in pretty short order.

The point where Lindsey's situation is concerned ... I've read enough of
Lindsey's material to know he didn't write that paragraph. Lindsey is pretty
straight arrow -- he wouldn't pass the paragraph out and misrepresent it.
This tells us something: The Feds see the handwriting on the wall. Sixty
years of institutionalized tyranny are about to come to an end. The DoJ
doesn't want to talk about a class action settlement at this juncture
because conceding the Fifth Amendment remedy in a class action decision
would bring about a disorderly situation. But they can clearly see that
the game is up.

One of the most powerful attributes of the extropy meme relates to the way
it sympathetically supports all approaches to expanding and improving
sentient life, while focusing on emerging technologies. I like that.

Perhaps we put the extropian cart before the conventional horse when we
attempt to gain life eternal without first comprehending life.

Wilson's work on consilience represents a milestone in the unification of
all the sciences, the social as well as the natural sciences. Highly
recommended reading, and if any senior members of this list would like to
open a thread on the subject, I'd joyfully engage it (as a self-evidently
junior subscriber, of course).

Cheers,

I saw _eXistenZ_ last weekend; I thought it was well worth seeing,
though quite different from _The Matrix_.  It wasn't stylish at
all, at least in the slick style of _The Matrix_; it looked distinctly
low-budget by comparison.  On the other hand, I got the idea that
the low budget look was part of the "point" of the movie (substitution
of drab VR scenarios, with shallow characters, hackneyed plot-lines,
and circumscribed possibilities, for the real thing).  As you might
gather, it casts a rather jaundiced eye at the possibility of "total"
VR.

Much of the film had a squishy, slightly gory character in keeping
with some of Cronenberg's earlier films (_Videodrome_, _The Brood_);
the game consoles are fleshy, vaguely sexual-looking appliances
that gurgle and squeak, and have breast-like extrusions that have
to be squeezed, and nipples that have to be stroked, to operate them.
They're connected to their human operators with a cable that looks
a lot more like an umbilical cord than a wire, and is plugged into an
opening in the spine called a "bioport", which looks like (in closeup),
and in some scenes is treated as, an additional body orifice in a
quasi-sexual
sense.

I thought it was a hoot -- by all means, see it.

The problem with this strategy is that it reinforces a right everyone
already has.  No one is compelled to file their tax return or sign it.
Everyone is "free" to not comply with the Internal Revenue Code.  However,
the IRS and the Department of Treasury are empowered to invoke the
provisions of the IRC (including 'late filing' penalties, 'lack of filing'
penalties, 'nonpayment' penalties, and interest on all of these penalties
and on taxes owed).  Additionally, the law allows the IRS to place and
enforce liens against your property in order to collect taxes.  While this
strategy might get you out of contempt charges, it won't stop the IRS from
liquidating your assets.  Just because you aren't required attest to whether
or not you broke the law or to supply evidence that might incriminate you,
that does not eliminate the judicial remedies available to governmental
agencies or insulate you from them.

The IRS can determine your tax liability without your help.  If they are so
inclined, they can fund a fairly invasive investigation.  If you work they
have 1099s to track your income.  If you are self-employed, your customers
must also supply 1099s for payments over certain amounts.  If you aren't
employed there is no tax liability to avoid in the first place.  If you're
not employed but have tons of bank accounts and securities that pay you
dividends and interest, the IRS receives 1099s for these amounts also.

The most cogent cases I've seen are the ones that attack the government's
authority to assess tax in the first place.  However, the Supreme Court has
discarded this argument in various vicissitudes several times.  The argument
is so inadequate now that it is the grounds for frivolous claims charges.

Finally, this DOJ employee, as well as yourself, should be careful spreading
this "strategy" about since to the extent someone relies on this strategy,
there could be vicarious liability issues for yourself and the DOJ employee.

I have just updated the conference web pages on ExI's site. A list of
confirmed
speakers is now up, and an updated Program. The program is still in flux,
as we
add more speakers to the line-up, and as we make adjustments based on topic
focus and speaker availability.

Among the experts from outside the familiar Extropian circle are:

Prof. Judith Campisi, Head of the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology and
Group Leader, Aging and Cancer Research, Berkeley National Laboratory.

Calvin Harley, Ph.D., Chief Scientist, Geron Corporation, Menlo Park,
California.

Prof. Cynthia Kenyon, Dept. of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of
California, San Francisco.

Prof. Michael H. Shapiro, Dorothy W. Nelson Professor of Law, University of
Southern California Law School.

For the complete list and program update, please check out the new conference
web pages. And expect more frequent updates from now on.

The Biotech Futures (Extro 4) conference seems to be coming at a time when
interest in the topics we're focusing on has never been higher. Besides being
the biggest extropian/transhumanist networking event of the last two years, I
think the conference offers a perfect opportunity to catapult more of our
thinking into the mainstream.

Finally, please note that some of the Saturday evening sessions are still
open.
If you have a proposal for a talk/panel/debate, please let me know. The
evening
break-out sessions can be a bit less formal and more forward-looking than the
daytime sessions.

Onward!

The following is a quote from  _Consilience_  which explains my thoughts on
this thread.
 
"I believe that in the process of locating new avenues of creative thought,
we will also arrive at an existential conservatism. It is worth asking
repeatedly: Where are our deepest roots? We are, it seems, Old World,
catarrhine primates, brilliant emergent animals, defined genetically by our
unique origins, blessed by our newfound biological genius, and secure in
our homeland if we wish to make it so.  What does it all mean? This is what
it all means. To the extent that we depend on prosthetic devices to keep
ourselves and the biosphere alive, we will render everything fragile. To
the extent that we banish the rest of life, we will impoverish our own
species for all time."

*I have separated the last sentence from his original paragraph for emphasis:

"And if we should surrender our genetic nature to machine-aided
ratiocination, and our ethics and art and our very meaning to a habit of
careless discursion in the name of progress, imagining ourselves godlike
and absolved from our ancient heritage, we will become nothing."

Well, what citizens can do is examine the way the government spends money.

All government records besides some are available on request.  The Sunshine laws
on campaign financing are in effect.

The government spends citizens' money on all kinds of things.

There is a question about taxes on whether they should be progressive or not.
What that term means is that richer people are taxed more.  A tax should be
neither progressive nor regressive, in terms of basic quality of life and right
to secure a livelihood and capability to have a retirement.

The tax code has a myriad of conditions and forma that are interrelated with
different economic sectors with much specially determined allocation.

Rates on quantities should be taxed at the same rate.

Research and development is the primary driver of growth.

If the government can not suborn property rights for copyrighted material, then how
can it possibly suborn driver's license and identification information?

So in this case, we see that tax dollars are used to pay for "the wholesale ripoff of
millions of people's copyright rights."  Thus the government is stealing from and
liable to the citizen.

The recent cases about selling license data to third party vendors and similar cases
of privacy and default personal copyright infringement show that the government
misuses citizens' data.

The government should pay and engage in conventional party to party transactions to
pay for the rights to such data.

Government data between agencies should not necessarily be shared.  For example,
because citizen A has dealings with goverment agency 1 and 2, neither one or two
should share information about that.  That means when these public organization's data
is available for review, then any comparison of these two public agency's public data
should not reveal that that private citizen's information is linked, unless citizen A
chose to use the same name for each agency or was otherwise easily confirmable.  In
terms of public information like property transaction and other real issues any
dealing of the government with a corporate entity should be open.  Now, for some
reason that implies that corporations are treated differently than private citizens by
the government.

The government's operations deserve much analysis and openness, they show how our
society works.  They are pretty much available, all budgets and expenditures, and a
huge amount of other financial information.

Thanks for the wealth of suggestions, both via posts to the list and the 
off-list emails.  I had not imagined I would get such a substantial 
response.  Thank you again.

Concerning the programming languages, there is a host of books out dealing 
with the languages people recommended. Anyone know which books are best for 
learning C, C++, Java and LISP/Scheme?

Thanks again for all the assistance!

I agree with Jim's description of the movie, but not his
recommendation to see it. There were no new ideas here
that I hadn't read about in any number of books or seen
before in other movies. In fact I felt the whole thing,
especially the ending, was quite simplistic and very
unfulfilling (sp?).

Your analysis appears to match reality.

Any magnetic storage degrades with time _unless_ rewritten periodically,

but the data could be copied to a fresh tape each time, ad nauseam.

I copied my old 9 track magtape data to ExaByte technology some time ago,
but the tape transport unfortunately could no longer read some of the tapes
due to magnetic degradation.  I understand there exist special methods
to read the data even after a normal tape transport will reject the tape,
but such methods cost much more to use, and unless the data loss would
mean a catastrophe, most would not consider those methods a viable solution.
_I_ sure did not.

My old Hollerith cards and paper tapes, however, show no degradation
whatsoever..

The DNS (Domain Name System) data is distributed over the whole Internet, and
there exists no "entire DNS database", except in the mind of the abstractor.

You could, in theory, ask every DNS server for a copy of their data base, and
make a single data base of the data.  In practices, however, the can be
considered _impossible_:
(a) the data would be stale and incomplete at the same time:
    the data change all the time everywhere.
(b) the data base would require very large amounts of memory to store.
(c) the bandwidth to copy it to your node would be enormous.

I'm not sure where I remembering reading this, but I was quite dismayed with E.O
Wilson when he  expressed similar disdain towards Space Migration - he believes
our optimal future is one fully integrated with our biosphere.

I just finished Earthweb (I got it from Amazon as soon as I read about
its release here;  thank you!).  Overall, I found it highly enjoyable.
It's a great novel of ideas, esp. ideas that we frequently discuss on
the list; featured
prominently are:
 
rotons
private law enforcement agencies
collaborative filtering
idea futures
fees for unsolicited email
credibility ratings for web postings
free-market incentives for research
private currencies
widespread encryption & surveillance tech 

Background stuff mentioned but not expanded upon:

the demise of Microsoft
the demise of the Federal govt in "The 
Entitlement Crash"
privatization of most govt functions
knowledge agents

Sequels are a definite & welcome (by me) possibility.

The story moves pretty quickly (all the action takes place over a month)
& only occasionally lapses into long expositions on various ideas,
usually justified in the context of the scene in question.  I must admit
some of the characters seemed a bit 2-dimensional to me, but not enough
to
detract from my enjoyment.

Things I didn't see that surprised me:

not a single mention of nanotech
no mention of life-extension (2 characters
are centenarians, but it's not clear how
unusual this is)
not much in the way of biotech

Since the novel is set approximately 50-60
years in the future, I suspect most on this list would expect these
things to be well
along in their development by then.  A curious omission, but not really
detrimental to the story.  

Though it's probably preaching to the choir, I recommend this book to
all on the list.

Why would they not be able to go back to biology? Having bridged the
gap once, they will understand it fairly well at that point. Having
backups is common sense, but not the reason to never take the step
upwards/outwards.

The meme "something always goes wrong" is dangerous. It is a meme of
passivity, of never attempting anything. It is a meme that helps
luddites and conservatives to keep us "human" (i.e. trapped within
*their* system).  Sure, things do go wrong sometimes. But that can
often be fixed. And we are usually better off when we do something
about a situation than just accept it.

Sure. And I think that is a *good* thing. But I seriously doubt all
humans will take that step, there will always be a pool of people who
for a variety of good and bad reasons chose to remain human.

I don't know about Eliezer's claim, but the brain is definitely
changing at this age. I wouldn't say it becomes less capable, it is
rather a qualitative change in ability.

Very young brains are extremely plastic and quick learners - great for
learning languages perfectly, understanding a complex world and
generally building up a general person. The drawback is quick
forgetting and a tendency for irrelevant stuff to overwhelm. As we
grow up, our brains become less plastic, which is of course irritating
when you want to learn stuff but also makes our memories more stable
and enables more critical thinking. They are by now well informed and
trained, which means skills can be applied to a much larger extent
than earlier. Different mental ages have different advantages and
drawbacks.

In the real world, yes. Numerous groups have tried to eliminate property
rights to create this wonderful utopia, and have pretty well proven that
it's impossible. Communism works in small family/tribal groups, but fails 
horribly when attempted on a large scale. At the same time, trying to 
create property rights where they can't reasonably exist -- e.g. 
copyright on electronic media -- fails almost as badly.

Chandra, you have *no* idea what a hornet's nest you probably
just stirred up! Nothing gets the juices (and blood) flowing
like asking a bunch of nerds their opinions about computers!
It's our own little version of religious wars.

Of course, having said that, I will now proceed to blather on
and on about my own (admittedly biased) views on the subject...

BASIC's wasn't a bad place to start since it will start to teach
you about logic and some of the core concepts of programming. If
you wanted to get work programming *today*, you'd be best off
learning C or C++. And there are a lot of good introductory
primers out there for these languages. Unfortunately, I feel
like advising you to concentrate on C/C++  is somewhat akin to
giving someone advice in the early 70s to study COBOL as
preparation for a future coding career in the 90s. Believe me,
there's not too many people out there writing new programs in
*that* language. C/C++ are showing their age now, and I doubt
that there will be many new apps being coded with those
languages by the time you graduate from college.

If you want to learn about the kind of coding that will be
important when you reach adulthood, you probably want to
spend some time learning about *object-oriented programming*
(sometimes called "OOP"), and spend less time on *procedural
programming* languages, like the ones mentioned above.

    [Just by way of a very quick explanation of the difference
    between procedural and OOP languages -> When you write a
    program in a procedural language like BASIC, it is a lot
    like writing a recipe - "First do this bit, then do this,
    then add this and see if you need that and then stick it in
    the oven for this long." Object-oriented programs are a bit
    more like building something with Legos or Tinkertoys - you
    describe the basic pieces ("Here's a cog, here's a shaft"),
    how they can be modified ("Shafts can be long or short, and
    have sqaure or round ends"), and how they fit together
    ("Cogs can fit on the ends of a shaft this way or that
    way"). Just like Legos, once you have the pieces of an OOP
    program, you can reuse them to build bigger/better versions
    of your program or even entirely different programs. Once
    you're good, and have a nice "library" of objects, you save
    a *lot* of time, and write really powerful applications.]

Check out a couple books on Scheme or ObjectiveC ("ObjC") (the
MIT Press is a good place to check). These are both highly
regarded object-oriented programming languages - Scheme is based
somewhat on the classic Lisp language and is used primarily as a
teaching language (at MIT and elsewhere) to demonstrate basic
concepts and techniques; ObjC is based on C (which, admittedly,
is probably still the most commonly used computer language
today). ObjC is also used in many real-world systems and
applications today. (Btw, some people will try to convince you
that C++ is object-oriented too - don't believe them. It has
some OO concepts hacked into it, but it's not clean or
consistent - a bit of a Frankenstien's monster of a programming
language - arguably powerful, but hard to control and understand
completely). You'll probably have to learn how to at least read
C++ code, since it's so popular today, but I wouldn't waste any
more time with it than necessary.

A couple people mentioned Java. Anyone who thinks Java is
well-written has bought the hype. You can certainly have a lot
of fun with it, but there's precious little technical evidence
that it's going to be a major programming language ten years
from now. That'll grease a lot of people on this list, I'm sure,
but it's the truth as I see it from here.

XML isn't a programming language at all, but is rather a method
of formatting infomation so that it can be interpreted easily by
viewing applications. Similar to the way we have standard ways
of formating bibliographical info, for instance, regardless of
what language is being used (eg quotes around the titles of
magazine articles, bold book titles, and having the author, pub
date etc in a standard order). XML is a standarized way of
saying "OK, this is the type of info here in this document, and
this is how it'll be laid out". Not a bad thing to learn (just
like learning to read a bibliography is useful if you want to do
deeper research), but not really "coding".

As for platforms, someone mentioned BeOS. It certainly is
well-designed and fun to write for (and here at Primordial,
we're *big* fans of Jean-Louis Gassée, - the head honcho at Be
(we met him several times when he was at Apple)). But it's a
*really* niche platform right now, and mostly suited to
multimedia applications. Wait a little while to see if they can
make a go of it in the marketplace before committing too much
time to it.

Ironically, we've found that the Mac platform is the most
versatile right now, in terms of how many languages and how many
*other* platforms you can write code for. There is a product
called CodeWarrior (made by Metrowerks) that allows you to
develop applications using a number of programming languages and
for Macs, PCs, Unix/Linux boxes, Game machines, Pilots and other
handhelds. It's our development environment of choice here at
Primordial Software. Students (like yourself) can the basic
version (which is available for Macs or Windows) either
free/cheap.

Oh yeah - my background. I'm a founding partner and the lead
designer for Primordial Software in Boston. We're a software
development house specializing in mobile and ubiquitous
computing solutions for industry and retail. Mobile = handhelds
like the Palm Pilot, Ubiquitous = "everywhere", like intelligent
houses, cars, and factories that can understand commands which
are spoken or gestured. We have lots of ties to the folks at the
Media Lab at MIT.

Between everyone here we're probably fluent in about 3 or 4
dozen programming langauages. The operating systems we use
include BeOS, Unix (of various sorts), Linux, Open/NeXTStep (an
oldie but a goodie), Windows (again, of various sorts -
95/98/NT), Macs (both the regular MacOS and the new MacOSX,
which is really a combination of Unix,NeXT, and Mac - the next
big thing, I suspect) and *lots* of various mobile/handheld
device OSes like PalmOS, WinCE, EPOC32 and a dozen others no
ones ever heard of ;P

We're also designing our own new handheld platform. We got tired
of waiting for someone to do it right, and we want our
tricorders *NOW*!

Whew! Anyway, I'm sure you'll get as many different answers to
your question as there are people here on the list who will
answer it. Don't let it overwhelm you and remember that the
specific choices you make about what programming languages to
learn will matter *MUCH LESS* than the energy and excitement you
bring to any project. That's not just grownup blather - I've
really found that to be the case.

Also, at 13, keep your eyes open for what really jazzes you -
computers are pretty key (says the guys who makes his living
programming ;) but there's a huge world out there. Keep your
options open.

ON the contrary, it is quite easy to establish an internet based system of encrypted key registry approvals using a smartkey/PKI device. This will require a full time network connection, and a USB port on the user's machine. Rainbow Technologies has a great iKey system that can use some of the strongest encryption on a removable USB compatible smartkey. With it, the user's entire network permissions can be controlled, what apps they can use, etc, while at the same time the user's private key is never compromised to any system. Such systems are not in current use by anyone but the most high value software suppliers (CAD apps, etc) because everyone else gains more synergy in the market by allowing IP leakage that could be made up for with the expense of secure encryption in registration. While I currently own licenses to most of my software, I would say that at least 95% of apps I have learned to use were originally pirated copies or unregistered shareware. I found them useful but wanted tech support so I bought licenses. This also applies to electronic data sources. Properly pakcaged, they can all be made secure.

THis is not so with printed media. With the popularity of desktop publishing, the printed word is no longer a very protectable media form for intellectual property. Back when few people owned expensive presses it was useful, but no longer.

Oh yes, you can spend a vast amount of time creating all these complicated
profit protection schemes, but in the end it's totally pointless. The fact
is, if you're selling information then at some point you have to display
that information to the user, and at that point they can capture it in a 
free form and pass it on to anyone they desire. The only way to prevent
this is to also have total control over the operating system and CPU as well
as the software. 

As for software, I've lost count of the number of companies who've lost my
business because of their stupid dongles and profit protection crap; I just
won't buy software which may suddenly refuse to run for its own bizarre
reasons, and no company with a clue would buy software which will stop 
working if their Net connection goes down.

I've been enjoying (page 252 out of 900!) Neal Stephenson's new
book "Cryptonomicon" and wanted to recommend it to anyone looking
for something to read.

Cypherpunks, Cryonics, and he even mention's a group thinly
disguised as "eutropians".

You can download an excerpt (the first 74 pages) at

I think it's more appropriate to think in terms
of using an overall strategy for dealing with the
IRS.

An arsenal of "weapons" is available to do this.
The 5th Amendment is one of these weapons. "Weapons"
are available to effectively deal with all the
issues you raise below.

What weapons you decide to use is a question of
strategy. How you use any particular weapon is
probably best thought of as tactics.

As an individual you have a basic choice: (a) Blind
obedience to the entropic IRS system resulting in
your financing a wide range of political entropic
behaviors; or (b) Searching for ways to behave more
extropically in relation to the IRS system.

The first decision may be to decide whether it's
worthwhile to invest some time in "searching."
For example, if you're currently entropically
paying the IRS $10,000 a year, your "searching"
may result in your not having to pay that money
-- without your incurring significant entropic
personal risk.

A quick overview of 'Fiscal Freedom'
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/taxmain.htm> may
help you determine whether "searching" is
potentially worthwhile or not.

We could think in terms of a number of "memetic fields."
For convenience, all religious memes could be grouped
together as a "religious memetic field." Similarly, we
could think of a "poverty/wealth meme field," and the
same for "individual power/impotence," "freedom/slavery,"
health/illness," etc. Pemes = political memes. We can
also think of a "peme field."

In order to achieve what I call "level-3 freedom"
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/resplev.htm>, in my opinion, it's
necessary to become a "memetic/ontological individualist."
Ontology refers to the philosophy of what exists.

The "memetic/ontological collectivist" believes in the
reality of all kinds of "collective entities" and "social
organisms." The mental mechanisms that result in such
beliefs have been explored in '#TL05AB: ANTHROPOMORPHISM AND
RELATED PHENOMENA' <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl05ab.htm>,
'#TL07A: The Anatomy of Slavespeak'
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.htm>, and related
reports.

NSPIC = Neuro-Semantic Political Illusion Complex. NSPIC
essentially consists of the pemes in individual minds that
result in destructive political behavior. They also tend
to make the individual less powerful in dealing with the
coercive political behavior of others. NSPIC could also
be called "the peme field." See:
'#TL074: PEME-THEORY - BASIC, INTERMEDIATE & ADVANCED'
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl074.htm>;
'#TL075: PEMES = POLITICAL MEMES'
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl075.htm>;
'#TL076: TWILIGHT OF THE PHOBOCRATS'

The person who has achieved level-3 freedom has cleared
all negative pemes (essentially those that put the individual
at a political disadvantage) from his or her mind. He or
she regards the notion that so-called "social organisms"
exist as ontological illusions. It may be convenient for
efficient speech to sometimes talk of "society," while
recognizing that so-called "society" has no ontological
reality.

It's useful to think of "masters" and "slaves." "Masters"
could be regarded as those who command the "forces of
coercion"; "slaves" as those at the effect of the "forces
of coercion."

For speech convenience it may sometimes be useful to
collectively refer to "masters" as "the ruling class."

>But, memes are to social organisms (cultures) as genes are to biological
>organism.

In order to achieve level-3 freedom, the above needs to
be rejected. The "memetic/ontological individualist"
thinks in terms of "Memes are to the mind as genes are
to the body."

>Genes spead primarily not by infecting other organisms "virally"

>itself. Memes spread in a similar way: they direct the social organism to

The "level-3 memetic/ontological individualist" thinks in
terms of: The pemes in individual minds direct them to
think in ways that result in behaviors that maintain,
reinforce, perpetuate, and propagate the illusion of
so-called "social organisms" and the behaviors that
result from individuals clinging to such illusions.

There are certain negative pemes (such as the word
"government") and negative memes (such as the notion
of "cooking" food -- '#TL09 - HOW TO ACHIEVE SUPERHEALTH'
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl09.htm>) that practically
all humans all over the world suffer from.

I'm curious when people anticipate various diseases being cured.  I am
in no way knowledgeable about this, but my general sense is that it will
probably happen in this general order:

Cancer, if the big breakthroughs happening now prove themselves
Infectious diseases except retroviruses
Genetic diseases
Immune disorders
Rare disorders and disorders of unknown cause (including Chronic Fatigue
Syndrome)

I'm not sure where to put retroviruses, organs grown especially for
transplant, heart disease, psychiatric disorders, spinal nerve regrowth,
artificial retinas, diabetes, etc.

I would put Chronic Fatigue Syndrome as a disease of unknown cause; I'm
particularly curious if anyone has any sense of when it might get cured,
since I've got it.  (Advice also welcome.)

My reasoning: cancer is fairly well understood, and current experimental
treatments are very promising.  Infectious diseases are also well
understood, and it's a matter of getting control over the invading
organisms on a chemical level.  This is somewhat invasive and
potentially dangerous, but it doesn't involve any fundamental change to
the patient's body, and thus is less dangerous.

Genetic diseases are well understood, and have a single cause, but
treating them in adulthood involves both the discovery of a new
mechanism for changing the genes, and the risks involved of
fundamentally changing the patient's biochemistry.  Immune disorders are
poorly understood, and appear to have multiple causes.  Changing the
mechanisms of the adult immune system also seems very risky, as a number
of immune disorders involve too much or not enough activity, and it
would be easy to overshoot your goal and cause the opposite of the
problem you initially had.

Diseases that are still poorly understood, even with all of the
scientific tools we have to study them, seem as though they will
continue to be the most intractable, although I suppose that a single
new tool could reveal any given disorder to actually have a single
simple origin, and from there make it much easier to cure.

Any thoughts?  I have very little background to be making such
speculations, and I only put them up in order that someone more
knowledgeable can correct me.

Two programmer friends told me to read "Teach Yourself C++"; they liked
it because all of the code examples were 10 lines long or less, so you
could get right to the point.

I asked,

"Is it absolutely essential that people believe in the fictional concept
of "property rights" in order to interact productively and peacefully?"

Mark replied,

"In the real world, yes. Numerous groups have tried to eliminate property
rights to create this wonderful utopia, and have pretty well proven that
it's impossible."

Just as you can't peacefully take something from a child when the child
thinks they own the object, you can't "eliminate property rights" when
people still believe in the fiction.  As long as people honestly believe
there is not enough for everyone, they will try to hoard as many
resources for themselves as possible.  The concept of property rights
justifies this hoarding.  Of course, this collective hoarding behavior,
caused by the belief that there is not enough for everyone, creates the
situation where there is, in fact, not enough for everyone and further
reinforces the belief and the hoarding behavior.

In the real world, though, there is an abundunce for everyone.  One of
the main reasons that people aren't enjoying this abundunce is that they
continue wasting their time maintaining conflicts and divisions among
themselves.  Another reason is that people waste their time reinforcing
dominance relationships.  The classic example of this is the current
school system, in which children waste most of their childhood learning
how to be obedient and subservient rather than learning how to actually
improve their own minds and lives.

Mark, from your statement, I am unsure whether you believe that a
wonderful utopia has been proven impossible or whether you believe that
it is impossible to attain utopia by forcing people to stop living by the
concept of property rights.  It is popular to believe that utopia is
impossible because it justifies giving up on happiness and settling for
misery, which those who would dominate you would rather have you do and
have taught you this from the beginning.  Of course, forcing people to
stop hoarding property only creates more conflict and less desire for
people to work together peacefully.

I recognize the fact that people are much more intelligent, creative and
prosperous when they work together peacefully.  Whether they believe in
the concept of property rights is as irrelevant as whether they belive in
Santa Claus.  I view "property rights" as basically a truce between
fundamentally violent, contentious people that they will refrain from
taking that which the other "owns".  As a diplomatic ploy, it has been
somewhat successful.

However, if people did not continue maintaining traditions of conflict
and dominance and if they had some basic respect for each other, they
would simply have no desire to take that which another is currently
using, since they would not want to create a conflict between others and
themselves.  They wouldn't need the psychological crutch of "property
rights" to maintain a civil, productive society.

Do you reject conservation of mass-energy on the grounds that it is
socially undesirable?  Do you think that the US grain reserves
appeared miraculously because American farmers believed in sharing?
The paragraph above, while perhaps well-intentioned, is laughable.
Excludable property--resources that can only be used by one person
at a time--are a simple fact of objective reality, and no amount of
hand-waving and pretty prose can change that.  "Hoarding" can
exacerbate shortages, and even create them, but to think that
eliminating hoarding will eliminate all shortages is childish
fantasy.  Property rights may or may not be the best way to allocate
scarce resource; it is definitely the best one so far tried.  There
may be an even better solution, but I doubt that denying the
problem will lead to finding it.

Yes, I particulary appreciated this last parapraph from Wilson's book. He
has written a concise and cogent, not to say entirely compelling statement
in that one paragraph. The outstanding excellence of his analysis requires
reading the 297 pages preceding it to fully grok it.

(Wilson's last paragraph prompted me to add a new tag line to my email in
order to better clarify my own philosophical position.)

I would say it's much more of a frontier than a fringe.
It doesn't sit on the topical side of the scientific domain, but
rather provides a visionary generalization of its trends and a framework
for analysis of the long-term perspectives of social and technological
developments, as well as discusses a choice of goals and actions.

I'd say it's neither - rather, it's a direction of thought.
You can say that one may affiliate with other people who share
similar directions of thought, but with this stretch, one can call
physicists an affiliation; that maybe true to an extent but not the
main point.

Futurology is hardly a fringe either - any intelligent entity is
supposed to think of strategic goals _before_ any action.
If most of the humanity are playing little games while drifting
into the future they can't and don't want to, comprehend - well,
they can consider futurists a fringe, just as babies can consider
their nurse a fringe, but this view doesn't give deep insights into
the nature of the process...

Program, it isn't either.  "Consciously moving the Universe into the
better strategic future" is not a program.

So TH is, in my opinion, analysis of scenarios under the common assumption
that the evolution of the Universe will be continuing for a while and
Grand things are to follow (all alternatives to this assumption I ever heard
sound ungrounded and/or insane), attempts to choose among those scenarios,
and considerations on how things are related and what kinds of choices
one can make taking these things into account.


>  Would you agree - or, rather how would you describe a transhumanist ?



I would leave this task to my friends.

Just a hint - a transhumanist may be considered a new breed of a Renaiisance
person, combining reasonable understanding of the world with active
social position and interest in personal development, on the best levels
allowed by the modern civilization, and attempting to draw coherent connections
between them.


Also, you can look at transhumanist websites that explore all these issues
in sufficient detail.

Irrelevant.  Your claim was "we can't do that".  I was pointing out that we
move similar amounts of mass on a daily basis.

I know for a fact that it has been done that way - by everyone from the
ancient Egyptians on forward.  Thick blocks won't crack, and thin ones are
placed on a sufficiently sturdy support structure before being moved (you
can also play with the shape of the base of the ramp to reduce such
stresses).  Your motive force can be anything from humans (for small blocks)
to bulldozers (for big ones) to huge, custom-built engines (for really
gigantic objects).

I suggest you do some web searches on topics like "heavy hauling", "bridge
building" and "heavy construction".  You may find the results enlightening.

That isn't relevant.  You don't move gigantic objects (> a few thousand
tons) by renting a crane.  You do it by building a special set of machines
just for the job at hand.  If necessary, you also build whatever
infrastructure those machines require.  That's how a lot of modern mining,
bridge building and dam construction is done, and it is also what the
ancients did (albeit on a much smaller scale).

Now, I'm not sure what the theoretical limits to this would be, but I do
know that we can move 100,000 ton objects without even trying hard - trains,
oil rigs and all sorts of ships easily make it into this weight range.  That
is far beyond anything the ancients ever did, and it is also far below the
limits of what we could do if we needed to.

Why?  I would assume exactly the opposite.  It is standard practice for
journalists to decide what quote they want, then find someone who will give
it to them.  They get paid for selling airtime, not for giving accurate
information.  The more sensational they can make a show like this, the more
likely they are to be rewarded for producing it.

Not true.  As I said before, this isn't idle speculation.  There have been
dozens of projects in which archaeologists have actually built things using
the same methods they think that the ancients used.  The techniques behind
just about all of the famous construction in Egypt, Greece and the Middle
East have been demonstrated this way.  So have the techniques used to build
the statues on Easter Island, and there is spotty (but growing) coverage of
methods from India, Northern Europe and the New World.

They could not go back to biology for the same reasons that we cannot go
back to Stone Age life (without conceding the defeat of human civilization
in toto).
Furthermore, at present rates of environmental destruction, "they" (who
remain fictional) will have no biosphere in which to return. In addition,
the motives for trashing biology do not appear conducive to biological
resurrection.

This does not constitute a gap to bridge, or if it does, then traffic flows
one way only. For example, having reached adulthood, the butterfly cannot go
back to the larval stage. To conjecture that the hypothetical "they" will
have the necessary skills and technology to rebuild a dead Earth begs the
question: Why would they if they didn't need to? And if they needed to, that
would indicate an unforeseen dependence which shows the flaw in their desire
to become non-biological.

Experimenters called the only "backup" Earth ever tried "Biosphere II" and
although the enthusiasts involved learned much from their endeavor, the
greatest thing they learned relates to the incredible ignorance humans still
have concerning ecological systems and how they work. Science has not come
close to devising methods to simulate the complexity of large scale living
ecosystems.

This does not mean that Homo sapiens should "never" attempt to create
viable, intelligent, and wise artificial sentience. But we have not yet come
close to doing so. Indeed we may find, as some researchers have opined, that
artificial intelligence and artificial life mean approximately the same
thing. The motives for transcending biology parallel those for transcending
life. If you subscribe to transcendentalism (and the mysticism that goes
with it), I believe that empirical science will eventually overtake you.

The notion that, in the words of Wilson, "our species exists apart from the
natural world and holds dominion over it. We are exempt from the iron laws
of ecology that bind other species. Few limits on human expansion exist that
our special status and ingenuity cannot overcome. We have been set free to
modify Earth's surface to create a world better than the one our ancestors
knew" he calls "exemptionalism."

He continues:
"For the committed exemptionalist, Homo sapiens has in effect become a new
species, which I will now provide with a new name, Homo proteus, or
'shapechanger man.' In the taxonomic classification of Earth's creatures,
the diagnosis of hypothetical Homo proteus is the following:

"Cultural. Indeterminately flexible, with vast potential. Wired and
information-driven. Can travel almost anywhere, adapt to any environment.
Restless, getting crowded. Thinking about the colonization of space. Regrets
the current loss of Nature and all those vanishing species, but it's the
price of progress and has little to do with our future anyway.

"Now here is the naturalistic, and I believe correct, diagnosis of old Homo
sapiens, our familiar 'wise man':

"Cultural. With Indeterminate intellectual potential but biologically
constrained. Basically a primate species in body and emotional repertory
(member of the Order Primates, Infraorder Cattarrhini, Family Hominidae).
Huge compared to other animals, parvihirsute, bipedal, porous, squishy,
composed mostly of water. Runs on millions of coordinated delicate
biochemical reactions. Easily shut down by trace toxins and transit of
pea-sized projectiles. Short-lived, emotionally fragile. Dependent in body
and mind on other earth-bound organisms. Colonization of space impossible
without massive supply lines. Starting to regret deeply the loss of Nature
and all those other species." <end quote>

In short, Wilson's message comes to: Let's not kill all of us in the attempt
to transcend. We had better take care of the environment, or it can't take
care of us. The singularity that concerns Wilson involves the
bio-destruction of the Earth. His concern comes from science rather than
from fiction.

Yes, I think you've located the point at which something has gone wrong: The
use of the word "always." I should have written: Something _can_ go wrong.
Passivity indeed constitutes a huge problem. Far too few people work to
reverse the damage done to the biosphere. Far too few work toward reversing
the destructive trend of overpopulation. Far too many shirk the
responsibility to live up to human values of compassion, comprehension, and
community, choosing instead to live in a fantasyland of denial.

Consilience means to bring all "*their*" systems together, to unify
knowledge, and to bring consistency to all the sciences, and especially to
sort out which systems have validity and which do not. Humanity needs to fix
the natural environment before it becomes too late to do so. Let's stop
accepting the fat cat political party line that economic growth takes
precedence over preserving natural resources. Let's do something about the
approaching ecological apocalypse instead of just accepting it.

Nietzsche took me Beyond Good and Evil (the title of my favorite Nietzsche
book) many years ago. Talk about "dangerous memes" -- "there will always be
a pool of people" looks to me like one of the most dangerous of all.

It seems to me that the only choice any living human has concerning
remaining human or not remaining human comes to this:
One can choose to grow up and take responsibility for the ecological
holocaust industrialized humanity has wrought (which means becoming fully
human in my estimation), or one can choose to cling to immature notions that
somehow it will all work out and one can remain enthralled by futuristic
fantasy. If one chooses the latter, one should know that one deserves the
wrath of following generations of humans, who may consider this negligence a
crime against humanity.

Excuse my harshness, but the situation in the "_real_ real world" as Wilson
puts it, requires the application of severe and intense measures to solve
the problems of today and tomorrow. None of this in any way conflicts with
the reality of extropy as it seeks to build more complex habitats for more
sophisticated life forms. Indeed, extropy demands that humans put their
ecological house in order so that we don't plunge ourselves into another
Dark Age. To the extent that Homo sapiens remains passive about
conservation, it thereby makes itself entropic.

The way I see it, extropy means the movement toward more powerful ways to
enrich and expand life. The first and best use of extropian tools involves
cleaning up the mess humanity has made. The Sorcerer's Apprentice will not
remain an apprentice, we may hope. But if the Scientist does not remain true
to science, humanity has not much for which to hope.

Opposition to consilience, IMO, comes from the meme that favors remaining
mechanical. I see signs everywhere that the Machine Age wants to become the
Bio-genetic Age. The consilience of genetic programming, artificial life,
molecular biology, neurobiology, cryonics, synthetic evolution, and so on,
holds tremendous promise when combined with other sciences to go beyond
neo-luddite mechanical prosthetics. However one defines life, it will
surpass human life by creative biological reproduction rather than by
selfish mechanical replication.

Question from a non-expert: How does this fit in with the idea
of quantum teleportation? i.e. if quantum teleportation is
somehow instantly changing a pair of particles no matter how
far apart, how can that work when the CA is limited to a max
speed of info transfer?

I found it very interesting how this actually revises the
idea that you gain mass as you approach the speed of light...
instead you sort of "out run" the CA such that it can't
transmit all the force info onto ya ?

I also found it quite discouraging that it is impossible to
break out of the sim on our own. Perhaps we can somehow get the
attention of the people running the sim and have them upload
us into "real space" ?

Quantum teleportation does not occur instantaneously.  Classical
information must be transferred --- at light speed or less! --- in order
to effect the teleportation.

hoarding will eliminate all shortages is childish fantasy.  Property
rights may or may not be the best way to allocate scarce resource; it is
definitely the best one so far tried.  There may be an even better

Most property that humans use is created by humans, and we can always
create more.  There is a finite amount of accessible natural resources on
Earth, but there is plenty to provide all humans with a very comfortable
living situation, with current technology.  Because humans generally view
most other humans as enemies, they refuse to cooperate with each other to
provide a comfortable situation for all involved.  This perpetual war
among most humans is the source of most human problems.

"Property rights" is a good solution when people have little respect for
each other and would routinely deprive each other of the basic
necessities for living.  But the concept of property rights does little
to heal the underlying hostility among humans.  If people were not so
hostile towards each other, there would be no need for "property rights".

The problem is this strategy was used as far back as 1927 and was ruled
ineffective by the Supreme Court. _Sullivan_ (47 SCt 607).

Evidently, another individual responded to my post, let me repeat my
response here since you appear to be raising the same issues (I leave the
individual as anonymous since he responded via private email):

Anonymous stated:

"For illustration purposes, let's take section 7203,
"Willful failure to file". This sections states that it is a
misdemeanor towillfully fail to file a return that is required.
Well, there are hundreds of different returns. If you are required
to file an income tax return, this would not apply to a return
that is used for the filing of manufacturing taxes on the
manufacture of bus chassis'. There needs to be an underlying
requirement, which must be stated in the charge. Unfortunately,
when this charge is made, there is never an underlying statute
or return mentioned. How can one plea guilt or innocence to a
charge when the charge is not clear? The reason they do not is
that most of the time, they are trying to use it agaonst someone
who did not file a 1040. However, the law requires very few
citizens to file a 1040. That is why they never list the form
required in the charge (more on this later)."

The Supreme Court has addressed this issue already, 70 years ago
no less. In _Sullivan_ (47 SCt 607), the Court stated that
"[p]rivilege against  incrimination in Fifth Amendment is not a
defense to an indictment charging failure to file return, and does
not authorize a refusal to state the amount of income, though the
taxpayer,s income was made in crime." To apply the Fifth Amendment
in the manner you are describing was described by the Court as
"extravagant" and "extreme" (actually referring to a less extreme
application of only refraining from disclosing illegal activities).

Furthermore, Section 7203 has been successfully applied on many
occasions against "Fifth Amendment" protestors.  See _Vance_
(730 F.2d 736) and _Grabinski_ (727 F.2d 681).  Given the judicial
stance in the Appellate courts which is further buttressed by the
Supreme Court, I would like to see the counsel who would assert
your reasoning in a proceeding.

Additionally, your own personal version of 'constitutionality' will
not qualify for the good faith defense.  See _Payne_ (800 F.2d 227).

If a client came to me wanting to assert this defense I would tell him
I did not want to steal his money because there is no chance he would
prevail.  Why not assert that any payment is not made in cash but in
Federal Reserve Notes that are mere promises to pay and are not
redeemable in gold or silver? (though the courts have shot this down
too I believe).

Anonymous later wrote:

"According to 26 USC 6331(a), levy may only be made on the accrued
salary or wages of an officer, employee or elected official of the
United States or District of Columbia. Furthermore, levy must be
made through seizure. Seizure, according to the CFR, may only be
made (for tax reasons) if the taxable activity in question is a
stamp tax (i.e., manufacture for retail re-sale of alcihil, tobacco,
or firearms)."

Perhaps you should flip back to Section 6321 and reconsider this
stance.

Anonymous later wrote:

"Care to provide cites for these cases. This argument has won several
times as well. Again, they can assess a tax if: it is a stamp tax,
a return was filed, or they have consent form the "taxpayer". That is
what the law says - exactly!"

Check out the cites I've referred to above and citate them back as well.

One last thing, let me bolster my point of 'vicarious liability' with the
following excerpt from a respected treatise concerning tax protestors:

>The most commonly used civil sanctions against tax protestors are
the damages of up to $25,000 that the Tax Court routinely imposes upon
taxpayers  whose petitions assert frivolous positions or are filed merely
for delay; the $500 administrative penalty the IRS exacts for filing a
frivolous tax  return; and the routine imposition by both district courts
and courts of appeals of costs, double costs, and the government,s
attorney,s fees on taxpayer litigants who raise frivolous arguments
against the tax laws.<

In responding to this message, be mindful of the _Payne_ decision
when proselytizing a personal view of constitutionality and address the
Courts.  Address how your position has such force that a judge would
discard the words of every Appellate Circuit, the Supreme Court of the
United States, among other authorities.

Believe me, I am not as blindly dismissive of your ideas as you might
imagine--but I still think you're so far from reality here that it's
in a different zip code.  Your assumption that there exists "enough"
physical resources for all humans rests on the faulty notion that
there is such a thing as "enough", or such a thing as a "comfortable"
standard of living.  No such thing exists.  The human will is infinite,
and the resources to serve that will are finite.  I "hoard" resources
to my will not because I begrudge others their will, but simply
because I value my own, and the two inevitably conflict.  I genuinely
want every human on the planet to be wealthy beyond their dreams, and
every human /will/ be wealthy beyond the dreams of /today/'s humans
tomorrow.  But when that happens, the infinite desires of all humans
will ensure that some will want more, and more, and more.  That's a
good thing.  If our resources ever become "enough" to satisfy our
wills, then our wills are too limited.

I am reading this CA paper, and I have a couple of concerns about it.

The main claim of deriving special relativity from CA theory is in
section 9.  They say:

: Special Relativity theory is founded on two basic postulates:
: 
: (1) The velocity of light in a vacuum is constant and is equal for all
: observers in inertial frames (inertial frame is one in which Newton?s
: law of inertia is obeyed).
: 
: (2) The laws of physics are equally valid in all inertial reference
: frames.

which is OK.  But they claim that there is no explanation of why (1) is
true in terms of (2).  Actually from what I understand (1) follows from
(2).  The Maxwell equations for electromagnetism predict the existence
of EM waves which travel at a speed determined by various properties
of the vacuum.  If you measure those properties the speed works out to
c, the speed of light.  Hence Maxwell's equations predict that light
propagates at a speed of c.  If you assume (2) then it will propagate
at c in all inertial frames, hence (1) follows.

Now, here is their explanation for (2) in terms of the universe as a CA:

: The second postulate of special relativity states that the laws of
: physics are equally valid in all inertial reference frames. Stated
: in a weaker form, there are no preferred reference frames to judge
: absolute constant velocity motion (or inertial frames). This latter
: form is easily explained in CA theory, by remembering that all cells
: and their corresponding rules in the cellular automata are absolutely
: identical everywhere. Motion itself is an illusion, and really represents
: information transfers from cell to cell. To assign meaning to motion
: in a CA, one must relate information pattern flows from one numeric
: pattern group with respect to another group (the actual cell locations
: are inaccessible to experiment). Therefore, motion requires reference
: frames. Unless you have access to the absolute location of the cells,
: all motion remains relative in CA theory. In other words, there is no
: reference frame accessible by experiment that can be considered as the
: absolute reference frame for constant velocity motion.

This is so vague as to be meaningless.  There is no reference to any
properties of the CA other than that it can let patterns "flow" from
place to place (somewhat like gliders in Conway's Life).  Does it really
follow from this very general property that the laws of physics would
be the same in all reference frames?  Just because patterns can flow,
it follows that absolute velocity can't be detected, and that physics
is the same for all uniform observers?  I don't think so.

Light, in their model, is a disturbance propagating at the maximum
speed of one cell per tick in the CA.  And in fact CA workers often
do refer to one cell per tick as "the speed of light" by analogy to
relativity theory.  In section 9.3 the authors attempt to show that
all uniformly moving observers will measure the speed of light to be
the same in all directions.  But again I didn't find the argument clear
or persuasive.  For one thing, it would seem that the geometry of the
CA array should be relevant.  In a three dimensional cubic geometry CA
(which they choose without discussing other polyhedral geometries),
disturbances can propagate faster in the diagonal direction than along
the axes.  Living in such a CA would seem to give a set of preferred
directions.  They don't seem to discuss this effect.  They don't have
a clear definition of how clocks and rulers would be expected to work,
making it hard to interpret their explanations of what people would see.

Overall I can't help feeling that they have jumped past the hard parts
with some handwaving and vague arguments.  If the universe is a CA, it
would seem that there ought to be some constraints on the properties it
would have.  Their arguments would apply to virtually any CA, and that
can't be right.

The preservation of human biology does not contradict or disagree with
extropy (or with you I imagine).

What Wilson referred to in his last paragraph of _Consilience_ has to do
with prosthesis, not with augmentation. Extropian augmentation amplifies
human biology. Entropic prosthesis merely supplies crutches and accessories
to devolving organisms.

It seems to be a rare thing here that someone doesn't equate the
transhuman future with the time when he/she can get to have everything
in the universe, and tough luck to anybody else! Surely an increase in
technological/sociological/xxxxological state implied by the Singularity
must leave in tatters our ideas of property/free market, just as it
leaves in tatters most other concepts of current western culture, which
all appear to trace back to fundamentals of limited lifespan and
scarcity.

Rugged individualism indeed. But are there alternatives? 

If there were some viable system of managing it (anyone?), then why not
have resources available to all who need them. The premise behind this
is that pragmatically, nobody really needs more than a small fraction of
these resources at any one time. Of course there would end up being
limits, but I don't think that they should be any worse than the limits
of private ownership of property, where each person only has access to
what he/she owns, what the government provides (at some cost!), and what
others are willing to lend/give.

If it works well, then the resources available to most people would be
far greater than those they might otherwise have access to. Maybe the
Gates/Turner/Murdochs of the world might have to come down a peg, but
for the rest of us, why can't it be beneficial?

I think that the concept of infinite personal wealth through capitalism
is flawed. People are attracted to it because it is possible, whereas
without property ownership it is not. But possible is not probably. Not
many can actually do it, lots of luck is involved. and those who do
either start with a massive kickstart or devote their entire lives
primarily to accumulation of capital, which really is an empty and
pointless pursuit.

So in the end, those who have truly noble pursuits in mind often don't
have the means (because they are devoted to the pursuit, not to aquiring
resources toward that pursuit), and those who have the resources often
don't have any idea of what to do with them (except maybe for sensual
stimulation and aquisition of more resources). 

I'm interested in the nexus between the dream of technological
salvation, and the dream of capitalist success. The idea that
technological advance will benefit us all seems to clash with the
reality that technological advance benefits the owners of the technology
(wealthy people) and often disadvantages the great majority of the
population. I don't think that the "crumbs from the rich man's table
theory" (the trickle down effect) really makes up for the increased
ability of people who already control large amounts of resources to get
their hands on more, to the detriment of others.

The usual line of reasoning on the forementioned moves toward the
conclusion that technology must be bad and it should stop. Of course I
am not a going to take such a technophobic line, and in any case, trying
to stop humans discovering/inventing/using new things is like standing
in the surf trying to hold back the waves with cupped hands (good luck
banning cloning). I am of the opinion that it is the economic/social
system, not technological advancement, which causes these problems.

I'm not in favour of a socialist system, however - is anyone disposed
this way on this list? Everyone seems to love the government...

What about some form of techno-anarchy, where we use the excellent
communications which are now just developing across the world, and are
going to advance wildly in the next couple of decades, to allocate
resources to anyone who asks for them, on some kind of loan system.
Maybe you keep track of who's had how much (ie: currency), or maybe you
don't bother. Maybe you need other people to volunteer support to your
"cause" to aquire more than a certain amount of resources, or maybe
little governing committees just spring up around areas that they are
interested in, without any higher level organisation (much like
newsgroups/mailing lists, but with decision making power).

This is pretty basic, re-inventing the wheel kind of stuff, but I think
it's important to realise that capitalism (or owning things) is not the
only possible social system and may not be desirable as social needs
change in the next century. I think that it will be altogether
undesirable, as will fall as it becomes less stable and more of a
barrier to our potential. It is an artifact invented by humans, and can
be superceded by more advanced artifacts (invented by transhumans).

PS: But in the mean time, I'll be aquiring all the wealth I can get my
hands on, because I think real life extension is going to be X-Pensive!

Its a simple matter of human nature. Different people have different extroversion/introversion levels, so we each have different ideas of what one's personal boundaries are. There is also, as you said, a matter of respect for others, but usually those with little respect for others also have little respect for themselves, or have less respect for others than they have for themselves. For these reasons, we do need formalized systems of establishing boundaries.

The reason why systems of government gradually gain in tyranny over time is that the overbearing busybodies constantly erode the formerly established boundaries with the goal of making everyone's boundaries more like what they are comfortable with, while the introverted individuals are in a live and let live mode, and would rather do little other than try to evade repression of themselves individually, because they are not very cooperative individuals by nature, while the extroverts are far better at cooperation. Eventually, the busybodies reach a point of tyranny where the introverts snap and declare NO MORE. Many of the introverts will kill off many of the the extroverts and reestablish a more conservative concept of boundaries. This is revolution.

Early signs of fomenting revolution are an increase in reprisal attacks of introverts on their extrovert opressors (Columbine HS, Tim McVeigh, the militia movement, etc), and mixed public sentiment about publicized episodes of the extroverted tyrant bringing introverts "to justice" for the crime of merely trying to separate themselves from the body politic to a degree that is not politically correct (the Branch Davidian seige/massacre, the Ruby Ridge ambush, and the "Roby Ridge" standoff).

My personal view is that when the technological trends reach a certain slope on the techno-genetic gradient, outright conflict will erupt not only between the luddite and technophilic demographics, but between the introverted/individualistic techno-libertarians and the extroverted/communistic proto-borganisms. This is not a 'maybe' or 'what if', but a 'when' and 'how much'.

We need to develop models, much like weather models, tracking the flow of molecules of air (people) in a chaotic system to see what, if any, means of controlling the destabilization of the socio-political equilibrium is possible to minimize the actual effects on human beings. We need a Hari Seldon at this point in history to see if the suffering can be decreased by long term dampening or a very short term shockwave type shift.

Those who doubt my introvert/extrovert dichotomy, look at the various leaders who have been part of cults of personality. With the questionable exception of Hitler, all have been extrovert personalities (I wonder about Hitler). If Hitler was in fact an introvert (I think he was more of a bipolar, myself) don't say that what he did was so much worse than the others. Stalin, Lenin, Mao, Chiang Kai Shek, and DeGaulle all caused as mach, if not more, human suffering and death. Stalin along outranks Hitler by several orders as an evil being. Even DeGaulle was personally responsible for the orders to arrest and kill 310,000 communists after WWII (an interesting case, most of the details of which are still classified) after he tricked the Communist Party boss  in France (and Stalin as well) into supporting his bid for power.

Today we have Bill Clinton, who has incarcerated more Americans than any President in US History, who is the first US President to be fighting two separate wars simultaneously (and he's a draft dodger, no less ;) ), a serial rapist, and pathological liar, who is steadily rebounding from one domestic scandal to another foreign scandal, and back again selling out the nation's military advantage for campaign dollars (a two-fer) while getting us bogged down in an ethnically based civil war in a country posessing no significance to us (not as much as the European countries, who preferred doing nothing until Bill prodded them into getting off their hinies). It seems as though the main european problem is that  most europeans regard themselves first as belonging to some minor ethnic group, then secondly as citizens of their country, while thirdly as europeans.

Yet it can't just be ethnically based, can it? I mean, we in the US have a far higher level of ethnic diversity than any other country, while at the same time having more guns and other weapons. Despite claims to the contrary, a european is far more likely to be killed in a violent crime in his or her lifetime than an American (of course, that is counting deaths in combat, military or civilian, as a crime, by somebody). It has to be the idea that we are Americans first, and ethnic only as an afterthought or of secondary importance.

Granted many Serb Yugoslavians have tried to live as europeans first, and tried to emulate American lifestyles, but they still associated their ethnic Serb heritage with the Serbian Republic, which is why Milosevic has been able to plot as he has.

Ah, an excellent point Hal. What geometries would in fact make the speed of light the same in all directions? It would seem to me that it would only be the same in all directions if every possible point on the surface of a cell were equally likely to be in contact with any other adjacent cell, therefore we imply the uncertainty principle.....and quantum mechanics.

I will have to debate this with you, J.R.  Wilson is talking about anything
nonbiological, I believe.  I take his "ancient heritage" as meaning our
human biology and remaining the same species.  Why doesn't he recognize
that it is part of human nature to change ourselves, not that it is
unnatural to do so. 

Indeed, we must be vigilant in using careful planning and respect for our
environment.  Albeit, this does not prevent us from using our intelligence
to plan and progress wisely.

Technological augmentations in extending life maximally will alter biology
forever.  Introducing new concepts broadens the ecology, thus altering it.

  In the 1980s, Apple Computer changed everything by employing a desktop 
metaphor on personal computers. But putting a desktop on a screen was easy  
theyre both two-dimensional. The plan for the next user interface 
revolution is a bit more ambitious  shove an entire three-dimensional 
office onto your computer screen. Theres an army of small companies racing 
to develop 3-D access to your data. It may sound far-fetched, but thanks to 
more powerful PCs and desperate cries of information overload from the 
masses, you may find yourself swimming through your data (rather than 
sifting through it) sooner than you think.
       PERHAPS YOU REMEMBER the ethereal Visual Thesaurus Web page that 
whipped around the Net about 18 months ago. Engineered by New York-based 
Plumb Design Inc., the entrancing Java application let users move through 
synonyms, which appeared to float by like leaves on a pond.
       It was almost three-dimensional, it was very cool and it had very 
little real-life function  3-D, after all, is only for games, isnt it?
       There have been high-end visual data programs such as SPS for some 
time, used by sophisticated researchers. And companies such as Toronto-based 
Visible Decisions Inc. have been telling finance executives since 1993 that 
its easier to make tough decisions based on pictures than on numbers. But 
those applications stayed, for the most part, on high-end Unix computer 
systems in college libraries, dark research offices or high-tech trading 
desks. And visualization tools were used exclusively to analyze data  not 
to serve as a full-time user interface.

       Not anymore. Theres been a flurry of recent attempts to transform 
the Internet, and even your home computer, from lists of files and folders 
that you open and close into physical space that you move around in.
       In March, portal Excite.com launched Excite Extreme, a 
three-dimensional front end for its Web service that lets visitors float 
through main sections My Excite, Channels and Tools. AltaVista.com, 
owned by Compaq Computer Corp., had already been offering a visual browsing 
feature, AltaVista Discovery, since August.
       In April, that cool thesaurus found a real-life application. Plumb 
Design, which created the thesaurus with its tool Thinkmap, sold the concept 
to Sony Music. The two launched a Web site April 14  advertising agencies 
looking to add music to a commercial now browse Sonys 200,000-song database 
by pushing around floating words that represent various moods or song 
categories.
       And most recently, a Xerox PARC spin-off called Inxight released a 
free downloadable applet called MagniFind that lets users view their hard 
drive in three dimensions, with file folders represented as floating circles 
connected by lines.
HOW DO THEY WORK?
       Excite Extreme, the Visible Thesaurus and MagniFind have very 
different looks, but work similarly. Each requires the user to click and 
drag to move through some kind of simulated space, then click to expand a 
tree of some kind. They feel very much like movable, expandable family 
trees  which they are.
       A hierarchy is a hierarchy, said Bernstein. Theres a number of 
ways to depict them. Neatly nested information  that is, data that fits 
into families  makes for a neat hyperbolic tree. That kind of data is 
more deep and not so wide. But if youre the type to have hundreds of 
files in each folder, your hyperbolic tree would need some pruning before it 
would be useful. Still, on MagniFinds Web site, Inxight puts its front end 
on the entire Usenet. It works, but it looks mighty crowded.
       Certain data makes sense to look at from a 3-D perspective, like the 
flow of air around a jet engine, said Spotfires Ahlberg. Other kinds of 
data look better in 2-D.

Wilson aptly names the part of human nature which would change itself, "Homo
proteus, or
'shapechanger man.'" Consequently, he shows himself as one who does indeed
recognize the naturalness of changing ourselves.

>Indeed, we must be vigilant in using careful planning and respect for our

Wilson recommends that we use our intelligence to prevent the catastrophe
which will result if we do not change our course. He favors the beginning of
environmental restoration.

>Technological augmentations in extending life maximally will alter biology
>forever.  Introducing new concepts broadens the ecology, thus altering it.

Wilson, I think, would agree.

It's worked well for four and a half billion years, so I think perhaps it 
can work for a little while longer.

Yes, but how are you going to stop the rugged individualists? You are free
not to use more resources than you choose, but then you're just fodder for
the first expansionist entity which comes your way looking for more resources
for itself. You seem to be another borganist who believes that they can --
and should -- force everyone else in the universe to think their way. Well,
it ain't gonna happen.

Um, because that's been tried, ooh, about half a bazillion times already,
and it always fails when tried on a large scale. Always. Otherwise the
world would be full of wonderful happy communist utopias and there would
be no argument as to whether they're better. On a small scale they are,
on a large scale they've always failed.

Sorry? I guess you've missed all the anarcho-capitalism discussions...
and I have a hard time not seeing your utopia as a socialist/communist
system.

And what do you do when you don't have enough resources (e.g. I want to 
a Jupiter-sized brain to run universe simulations, and I want it *now*),
or someone refuses to give it back after you've loaned it to them? And
who's going to do the shitwork of digging up all these resources that
you're giving out? Capitalism has answers to all these problems, these
kind of utopias never do.

Capitalism is not a social system, it's just what entities do when there's
no-one to forcefully interfere with their interactions. It's not perfect,
but it's a lot better than anything else we've ever tried.

Who's going to create more, from what and why? Recently I've been reading
'The shape of things to come', which aside from being probably the most
boring book ever written, describes yet another wonderful happy socialist 
utopia which entirely skirts around the question of who does the shitwork 
and why. Why should I work if I can have anything I want for free?

Of course I for one want far more than you consider 'comfortable'. For
your utopia to succeed, you'll have to use force to stop me getting what
I want. So much for respect, eh?

>Because humans generally view
>most other humans as enemies, they refuse to cooperate with each other to

I regard very few people as enemies... I just don't see why I should spend
my valuable time doing things to make the lives of people I don't know more
comfortable, if it doesn't help me. The great thing about the free market is
that I do make other people's lives more comfortable while I work for my own
ends.

And what's so great about 'comfort' anyway? Why does it seem that the people 
who live in 'uncomfortable' societies are often much happier than those who
live in 'comfort'?

>This perpetual war
>among most humans is the source of most human problems.

Indeed. If only people would stop trying to impose all these silly little
utopias on the rest of us we could get on with living our lives in peace.
But there seems to be an almost infinite supply of people with no respect
for others who believe they know better than us how we should live our 
lives.

>"Property rights" is a good solution when people have little respect for

You know, you complain and complain about lack of respect, but how much
respect exactly do you have for anyone who doesn't believe in your fantasy?
You keep telling us how bad and childish we are, and want to force us to
do what you want. How can you complain that other people don't respect you
when you don't have the slightest respect for us?

>and would routinely deprive each other of the basic

Uh, no, I don't routinely deprive anyone of anything. It's the socialists
and communists and borganists such as yourself who want to deprive us of
the things we've worked hard to acquire. 

>But the concept of property rights does little
>to heal the underlying hostility among humans.  

Crap. Property rights says "that's yours, this is mine, you can do what
you want with your stuff as long as you leave mine alone." Any believer in
property rights can get along with any other, it's only when thieves and
other non-believers come along that we get envy and hostility. 

>If people were not so

"If only everyone thought just like me, the world would be wonderful." True,
it would be a wonderful place for you, and a hideous place for the rest of
us. It ain't gonna happen. Deal with it.

I don't see how the actual physical structure of the CA can
possibly matter to us in this way. The CA might have any
number of physical layouts or properties, but all we can see
is the effect of it all. The cells may be programmed in such
a way that the diagonal speeds are the same as the other speeds.
We really can't tell how the hardware works can we?

No. But what was the issue here was the fact that the geometry of the
underlying grid of the CA makes the physics in the CA nonisotropic -
there are preferred directions where the speed of light is
different. For example, in Game of Life information from an event at
(0,0) at time zero will arrive to (100,100) at the same time as
information from time zero events at all points (x,0) where 0<=x<=200.
Clearly, this doesn't correspond well to our physics.

Besides the main Lakoff interview that Damien
mentions, there's also Lakoff's response to comments
(at http://www.edge.org/discourse/lakoff.html) which
has a useful 12-point list of "what we mean by a
computational model that has properties of neural
systems" - which emphasizes contingencies - and is
followed by Lakoff's statement - which should concern
transhumanists interested in uploading or
automorphing - that "'Functionalist' systems are
general symbol manipulation systems and they do not
have these properties".   - Mark

P.S. The latest and greatest (arguably of course)
work in the embodied mind or enactivist 'school of
thought' is Susan L Hurley's 9810 _Consciousness in
Action_ (see
http://www.hup.harvard.edu/Fall98/catalog/conscious_action.html):
"A standard view conceives perception as input from
world to mind and action as output from mind to
world, with the serious business of thought in
between. Hurley criticizes this picture..."

One way you can do this is by redefining the coordinate system on the
plane.  Map point (x, y) inwards by a factor of sqrt(x^2 + y^2) and you
map the square at unit coordinates into a unit circle.  This defines
a new metric for distance and should make velocities the same in all
directions in a CA model.  You'd then have to choose a CA so that when
rigid macroscopic objects are rotated, they'd automatically change size
appropriately based on this new metric.  It would be complicated but
could be done in theory.  I think this is the kind of work which you'd
have to do to try to show that our universe could be a CA.

And by the way, even if the universe can be nicely modelled by a CA,
it wouldn't mean that someone is running it on their computer.  It can
be modelled now by differential equations but that doesn't prove that
there is an analog computer running it somewhere.  The CA model would
just be a new and (hopefully) simpler model of the underlying structure
of the universe.

Suppose I decided that civilization was bad and evil. I could actually
go back to stone age with some preparation: buying up a suitable area
of land, getting the necessary training in wilderness survival,
recruiting some similar-minded people. Then we could move in. Most
people, not even rabid environmentalists, don't do this because they
find modern life, with all its problems, much more attractive. 

(But I'm sure there will be posthuman luddites claiming that physical
reality is the only good reality - while safely living on the Net :-)

Hmm, you seem to be making an awful lot of assumptions here. Why would
a posthuman trash biology? The people becoming posthumans may discard
their bio-bodies, but that doesn't mean they feel they have to wipe
out the biosphere too. Why would present rates of environmental
destruction hold in an era where people by assumption can do drastic
morphological changes and can afford to? Why can't a crashed biosphere
be restored?

I think you are trying to turn my argument around here. If they don't
want to go biological again, whats the problem? If they turn out to be
wrong (say that they discover a fundamental limitation in their
structure), that doesn't mean their *desire* was flawed, it just
lacked some information. If I go to live on the moon and discover that
I cannot stand the background radiation, it doesn't invalidate my
original decision.

I think you mix terminology a bit too freely here - transcending
biology is not equal to transcendentalism. An upload living in a
virtual reality is just as physical as the tree outside my window. The
upload has transcended some aspects of biology which many of us find
troublesome, while seeking to retain those organic aspects which we
find desirable - like cognition, emotion, the drive to grow and change
and so on. Nothing mystical in that, even if people sometimes do sound
religious about uploading. 

As I see it, AI and AL form another phylum in the broad sweep of
generalized life. I love complex systems just for their complexity,
interactivity and beauty - regardless of whether they are organic,
information or inorganic.

Yes, I'm Homo Proteus. But that doesn't imply that I turn my back on
the biosphere - quite the opposite. I want not just to preserve it,
but to extend it to new worlds.

Sigh. And everything discussed on this list is fiction? The problem
here is that Wilson (and you) seem to be stuck looking at things as
they have always been, looking for solutions inside the box. Moving
outside the box to something different is apparently not an allowed
option according to you. I disagree. I think that moving out of the
box is the only way of ensuring consilence.

Sounds great. But did you notice the "their" you used? Why not an
"our"? I think the consilience idea is a good idea, even if I'm not
certain if it will work I think it is worthwhile to pursue. But it is
dangerous to see it as something "we, the enlightened" brings on to
unify "they, the passive" - it is everybody's project.

I might of course be wrong about the persistence of homo sapiens, but
given my current information on how people think and act it seems
quite likely. Especially given that there are people holding your
views who might gladly (?) form a rear-guard so to say.

Exactly. But the first option doesn't rule out becoming
post-biological (in fact, it might even be argued that it would be
environmentally friendly if we humans went post-biological). Getting
the ecology to work might involve *more* high technology
(cf. pollution levels as a function of technology; as efficiency
increase, they decrease). You cannot just dismiss (say) a discussion
about nanotechnology and its environmental impact as futuristic
fantasy and remain intellectually honest; the honest thing to do is to
rationally look at the claims made and the support of them, and then
make a judgement.

You (or Wilson) seems to have made a dichtomy between the "good guys"
who are consilient, ecological and biological, and naive "bad guys"
who are post-biological and suffers from passive optimism. Then you
happily place everybody promoting posthumanity in the later category,
without really caring to look whether that person really belong there
or not. Maybe even these categories are bad?

Another dangerous meme, which has a track record with both some
impressive successes and some horrible disasters. Without being
connected to strong rationality and critical thinking it can easily
become a recipe for "the goals sanctify the means"-type activism that
does more damage than it helps.

Sure. But at least some of us have a much more generalized vision of
life - carbon is a special case.

Hmm, maybe this is the key to our whole quarrel: you see the posthuman
as a mechanical creature, while I regard him as a biological (if
inorganic) creature.

Mark asks:

"Why should I work if I can have anything I want for free?"

Can you have anything you want for free, even if everyone provides
everything they can for you?  What do you want?  Happiness?  Peace of
mind?  Discipline?  An active learning mind?  Loving relationships with
others?  Sanity?  An understanding of your reality?

Nearly every worthwhile aspect of living must be provided by oneself. 
Even the wealthiest and most doting of parents cannot provide happiness
for their children; the child must do that.  A fulfilling life cannot be
provided by others.  They may give you advice or set examples for you,
but your own happiness must be created by yourself.

Even when people have all of their physical needs taken care of, they
still work, because work is a pleasurable activity.  Like sex, it has
always been necessary for our species' survival, so we are naturally
inclined to derive pleasure from it.  It is only when we feel forced to
work that we do not enjoy it.

Providing one's physical needs is actually quite easy.  I have lived on
about $600 a month for the past few years, and I have lived quite
comfortably.  This level of income is well into the "poverty" level, yet
I am not impoverished.  This is why I say there are enough resources in
the world to provide for everyone's basic physical needs.  Nearly
everyone can earn at least $600 a month.

Of course, our physical needs are the easiest needs to fulfill, and they
can be provided by others for free.  Emotional, Intellectual and
Spiritual needs cannot be given for free; they must be developed by
individuals themselves, with some support from those around them.

So, why should you work when you can have anything you want for free? 
Most of what you want, you must work to provide for yourself, regardless
of how much others give you.

Mark stated,

"For your utopia to succeed, you'll have to use force to stop me getting
what I want."

Do you really believe that our basic goals are so contrary that I would
not get what I want by helping you get what you want?  Mark, I don't
think you realize how easily others can lead you around by your desires
(like dangling a carrot in front of a donkey).  You are actually quite
helpless to resist those who offer you what you want.  Would you refuse
your own desires?  Because I am intelligent, I would never use force to
modify your behavior.  If I did, you would resist me.  Because I am
intelligent, I would use your own deepest desires to change whatever
behaviors I wanted to.  

I can get far more cooperation out of you by helping you then by forcing
you.

My utopia is all about helping everyone achieve what they really want. 
Why would anyone resist that?

Mark complains,

"You know, you complain and complain about lack of respect, but how much
respect exactly do you have for anyone who doesn't believe in your
fantasy? You keep telling us how bad and childish we are, and want to
force us to do what you want. How can you complain that other people
don't respect you when you don't have the slightest respect for us?"

Why so much hostility, Mark?  I simply made the observation that people's
hostility towards each other is responsible for most of the world's
problems.  Why do you interpret this as though I am saying you are bad
and childish?  And why do you imagine that I have any desire to force you
to do what I want?  I have not expressed these things.  Your hostility
has made you misunderstand what I am saying.  

Because you are so full of hostility, you do not realize that we actually
agree on pretty much everything.  Because of your hostility, you feel you
must have enemies to justify how you feel, so you see me and others as
opposed to you, even though we are not.  I understand your hostility very
well; I have felt that way many times, and I still often do.  I simply
realize now that my hostility is responsible for most of my problems, and
I am working to move beyond that.

Whatever lack of respect you perceive, I do not feel that I am being
disrespectful.  I remember how often my own hostility has made me
interpret others' neutral or even positive statements as being insulting
or threatening.  

I point out your own hostility, not to be rude or condescending, but
because I know how dangerous it is.  You are part of my world, and your
actions will have an influence on me.  It is in my best interest to help
you escape the dangerous trap of your own hostility.

Because they refuse to deny the fundamental reality
that diverse humans /will/ have directly conflicting
desires.  That indeed that very diversity of interest
is what makes us unique and precious.

To the extent that I can get what I want by helping
you get what you want, that's great: it's called
trade, and I'm all for it.  But human progress is
made by those people who want /more/ than their
neighbor, and are willing to compete for it.

Do you realize how condescending this statement is?  In one breathless wave
of an arm you relegate all the thoughts, skills and feelings of another mind
to the category of "mindless idiots that I can easily manipulate".  And you
wonder why others react to you with hostility??

> My utopia is all about helping everyone achieve what they really want.

No, it is about helping everyone achieve what *you* think they ought to
want.  You don't know what *I* want, and you aren't going to - which is the
key to understanding why freedom works, and other systems don't.

You seem, however, to have some serious misconceptions about the basic terms
of this discussion:

> We can choose to live in the world we want.  By being kind, we choose to
live in a world where people are kind.

One of the most fundamental issues you need to face is that different people
will make different choices about what kind of world they want to live in.
If you want a society that actually works, you need to allow for that.

One of the most pernicious implications of this fact is the inevitability of
violence.  The more kind, loving and peaceful your society becomes, the more
tempting a target it will be for those who care only about themselves.  Any
society must therefore choose between being helpless in the face of
aggression, being armed and encouraging self-defense, or completely
destroying individuality in an attempt to eradicate potential criminals.

The same dynamic also operates on the scale of nations, which is why the
only countries that don't have armies are the ones that are so weak they
have no possible hope of defending themselves.

> There is a finite amount of accessible natural resources on
> Earth, but there is plenty to provide all humans with a very comfortable
> living situation, with current technology.

Yes, it can.  But a "comfortable living situation" means different things to
different people.  There is an infinite variety of ways in which we could
spend our finite resources - on food, clothing, education, art,
transportation, tools, toys, and on and on.  The key question in any society
is: Who decides which of these things we actually get?

The beauty of a pure free market is that the answer will always be "you do".
If you want lots of material goods, you can work long hours and accumulate
the money to buy them.  If you are more interested in leisure, you can adopt
a low-income lifestyle and work part time.  You can spend money on whatever
happens to interest you, and ignore everything else.

In every other system man has devised, there is some other person who makes
these decisions for you.  The government (or the collective, or the town
council, or whatever) decides for you - and they will almost never decide
the way you wanted them to.

Now, it is entirely possible that a society of SIs will come up with some
arcane social organization that makes this whole debate irrelevant.  But for
any society inhabited by minds that we can understand, the fundamental
issues remain the same.

BTW - This seems like a good place to point out that, by any objective
measure, there are no free-market societies on Earth.  The entire Western
world is properly described as socialist, and the rest of the planet ranges
from socialism to a whole gamut of autocratic systems.  Even the least
socialist of these countries have licensing and zoning laws, selective
tariffs, employer-employee relations laws, and all manner of other
infringements on the market.

Many of the things you bemoan in your initial post - "those who demand
obedience and conformity", "those who demand that I sacrifice my own
happiness to
accomplish their goals", "traditions of dominance and violence" - are
actually antithetical to pure capitalism.  This is because a truly free
market can only exist in a context of individual freedom, where everyone is
allowed to make their own decisions and run their own lives as they see fit.
It is the quest for a socialist utopia that leads to conformity, violence,
and the sacrifice of the individual.

I have to admit that I do not at all care (very) much whether our
universe is a CA or not. I think CAs are damn handy to write fast
forcefield engines which work well both on conventional and dedicated
hardware and _indespensable_ if you want to model reality with 
maximum speed on a nanocomputer.

A number of cellular automata show isotropic wave
propagation. Artifacts of lattice anisotropy do not necessary
propagate to macro level. Otherwise, lattice type has a large
impact. Some things work in cubic primitive lattice, some need hcp.

Ya gotta know I like you Anders, always have. But can you suppose forever?
Why make suppositions needlessly? The Back To The Land movement went out
with the 13th floor of history, namely, the 70s. Can't happen again one
should hope. Hippie Primitives give entropy too much of their time.

"Why would a posthuman trash biology?" Why would a human? But you can see it
all over the world.
You say "may" discard their bio-bodies because this assumption has no basis
in reality. What has no basis in reality trashes biology as it trashes all
other elements of existence -- by ignoring it. Present rates of
environmental destruction will most likely continue to accelerate, not
"hold" as you write. People do indeed "do drastic morphological changes" but
they really can't afford to. My point exactly. Homo sapiens cannot afford to
continue squandering natural resources. We lack the capability to restore
the industrial revolution, never mind  "a crashed biosphere" because as
technology feeds on itself, it first eats those who regress. Who will
restore a crashed biosphere? When you commit suicide, you don't get to
change your mind. If you look at the evidence Wilson presents in
_Consilience_ (forget about the book by the-inventor-of-the-internet-Al
Gore), you can see that Homo sapiens has decided en masse to commit global
suicide. I didn't get past pre-calculus, so I'll leave the math to someone
else, but the figures live on the net, if you want to validate them, I
guess. Anyway, the numbers cited in _Consilience_ show a trend toward
ecological collapse (or "a crashed biosphere" as you put it). To the
question, "Can you live forever?" one might respond, Can we keep the Earth

one should consider whether one will live in heaven or in hell, in a
paradisiacal dream or in a diabolical nightmare. Like the dogface said,
"Wake up and die right." (Excuse the association. It comes from the Balkans.

"argument" what argument? Let's discuss this. First of all "they" do not
exist. Right? So this discussion involves nothing more than hypotheticals if
you want to go there. But Wilson favors looking at the reality of the
situation as it exists today. He concludes, "To the extent that we depend on
prosthetic devices to keep ourselves and the biosphere alive, we ill render
everything fragile. To the extent that we banish the rest of life, we will
impoverish our own species for all time. And if we should surrender our
genetic nature to machine-aided ratiocination, and our ethics and art and
our very meaning to a habit of careless discursion in the name of progress,
imagining ourselves godlike and absolved from our ancient heritage, we will
become nothing." It seems to me that an extropian response to that reality
would involve reading the pages leading up to it, to decide if it deserves
our heeding it. But perhaps I can save time. Just tell me if you think
Wilson wrong to focus on environmental issues, and to urge restoration of
the biosphere, to rescue Homo sapiens from "a crashed biosphere" even if it
means remaining biological. Wilson says, in effect, if we don't do something
about bio-destruction, we will all die. Consequently, I see no reason to
quibble about whether or not he may or may not favor remaining biological.
As I think I stated earlier, I don't think Wilson actually "favors"
remaining biological as much as he prescribes it for the short term or at
least until we get thought this "bottleneck" of population/carrying
capacity.

Believe me Anders, if you go to live on the Moon you have my very best
wishes. (And just because we could send one Moony doesn't mean we should
send them all. Just kidding!) No one has sent anything to the Moon for a
while now. Doesn't politics suck? If I could live forever... Gosh! No one
can ever say "Been there done that" to anyone who has lived forever! I just
hope my age doesn't show too much. I mean I hope it doesn't show _to me_. As
an immortal, what do I care what other people think. Most of them will die
with their ageism in that dead old planet Earth. 'Course I'd go off to kick
moondust with Anders, and maybe try moongolf in the moonglow with our
moongirls. Or perhaps not.

Transcending biology requires belief in transcendence. If you don't believe
in transcending (i.e. transcendentalism), you won't transcend. Consequently,
if you don't believe in transcending, you don't believe in transcending
biology. "An upload living in a virtual reality" exists only in your
imagination. Wake up call. (I don't suppose you've made up the part about
the tree outside your window, but I couldn't know if you did, so it makes
little sense to mention it in this context.)

Despite ominous tones which appear from time to time on this list concerning
the Singularity, I thoroughly enjoy the upbeat optimism and positive
attitude embedded in the basic premise of the Institute. But I don't see the
Singularity doing the extent of damage to the biosphere that pre-Singularity
humans do now. Uploading obviously need not involve mysticism, I never said
it had such a need. But since it does not yet exist, it remains
hypothetical, as does mysticism. In addition, uploading requires
transcendence, the basis of transcendentalism.

Uh-oh, one might deduce from this that you believe it possible for complex
adaptive systems to favor biology remaining organic. Consilience most
definitely does not rule out the possibility of inorganic biology. So we
need to define biology. When we define biology and biological as organic as
well as inorganic complex adaptive systems, suddenly the contention that
Wilson favors remaining biological becomes moot. Uploading consists of an
extension of biology, IOW life.
Artificial Life, uploading, transhumanity,  = augmented biology, amplified
biology, modified biology, silicon biology, inorganic biology, but biology
just the same. Quarks = Quarks.

No, I didn't say "everything" give me a break. When I look "outside the box"
I see many trees with sun-dappled leaves swaying in the lingering warmth of
a springtime glowing afternoon. Do you still see your tree outside your
window?

The "only way of ensuring consilience" that Wilson (and I, much to his
chagrin possibly) offer, relates to moving out of the boxes that constrain
people from acknowledging the desperate situation of the ecosphere,
biosphere, Earth or whatever you want to call the totality of life that Homo
sapiens knows. You write that you "disagree" but only with something that
I've never agreed with. What moron would agree with disallowing movement
outside the box of  "things as they have always been"? That kind of straw
man jousting I should hope you will rise above.

I had quoted you, Anders. You used "their" instead of "our."
Back to the subject at hand: Many people think it worthwhile to "pursue"
consilience. Einstein pursued it with his Grand Unified Field Theory.
Physicists offer string theory to create consilience between quantum theory
and Newtonian physics. Wilson extends that Ionian principle to suggest
consilience between the natural sciences and the social sciences. Quite an
ambitious idea, since it would provide a Theory of Everything which
leapfrogs speculation concerning the plausibility of such ideas as
uploading. Complete scientific consilience would provide a perfect fit with
economics, politics, ethics, biology, physics, and especially psychology in
one unified theory of complex systems. The power of consilient knowledge
exceeds that of all present sciences by combining them into a super science
of unified information.

Sure, similarly people holding your views might commit mass murder.
Therefore what?

Homo sapiens may persist, or it may not. Cosilience remains consilient no
matter whether Homo sapiens remains biological or not. Neither Wilson nor
myself have expressed any belief that intelligent entities need carbon-based
organic structure or that we favor remaining biological. As simply as I can
put it, a species that fails to restore the biosphere will fail to migrate
to a non-biological form because such a species thereby proves it has no
sense of responsibility. Such an irresponsible species ignores the genetic
algorithms, organic chemistry, and Darwinian evolution that brought about
life, and buries itself  in imaginary scenarios of escaping the mess it has
made of the biosphere. Homo sapiens will clean up the mess, or it will die.
Plain and simple.

"environmentally friendly" perhaps. But avoiding ecological disaster will
require a commitment stronger than mere friendliness. It occurs to me that
the people who _do_ something about overpopulation and environmental
destruction may begin to dislike the people who do nothing, so I might want
to start interacting with them. (Got any leads?)

We don't need to get the ecology to work. It works fine if not polluted,
stripped, burned, nuked, paved, mined, etc. Nanotechnology may or may not
provide environmental resuscitation, but it hasn't yet... because it hasn't
established consilience with social sciences. You certainly show that you
have a firm grip on the bleeding obvious when you write that "You cannot
just dismiss... " But consilience does not have the same degree of banal
visibility. It takes a little effort to comprehend the repercussions and
consequences of _not_ understanding the principle of consilience.

No "'bad guys'" who are post-biological" exist. So it makes no sense to
dichotomize in relation to them at all.

I guess too many people take the admonition to "Live dangerously. It's the
only time you live at all"  (attributed to FN) very seriously. The rest of
your statement applies to organizations of any stripe, including extropians.

Sorry to hear you have considered this discussion a quarrel. <getting

I don't think we disagree about anything, or if we do, it only relates to
definitions of terms.

I leave you with this oldie-but-goodie from _Out of Control, The new Biology
of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World_, by Kevin Kelly,
Executive Editor of "Wired":

"The search for a Second Law of Biology, a law of rising order, is
unconsciously behind much of the search for deeper evolution and the quest
for hyperlife. Many postdarwinians doubt that natural selection alone is
powerful enough to offset Carnot's Second Law of Thermodynamics. Yet, we are
here, so something has. They are not sure what they are looking for, but
they intuitively feel that it can be stated as a complementary force to
entropy. Some call it anti-entropy, some call it negentropy, and a few call
it extropy. Gregory Bateson once asked: 'Is there a biological species of
entropy?'"

I'd say no.
What would you say?

I'm actually not intending to be offensive by the things I am posting on
the list.  I come off that way sometimes because I like to push peoples'
buttons especially if there really is no reason for them to be upset
except for their own psychological insecurities.  Then, if they are
upset, I like to point out why they are upset.  I believe that pointing
out to people the things that may end up being quite dangerous to them is
an ultimately kind thing to do, even though they may be temporarily
upset.  

The fact that people are getting upset over what I am saying when they
could just as easily choose not to be upset indicates problems with their
own coping mechanisms.  People are certainly free to ignore me if they
are offended by what I write.  I am just pointing things out that seem
obvious to me, trying to be helpful.  I don't think I am forcing my view
on anyone.  I'm just sharing my perspective, which I have found valuable.
 You can accept it as the gift I intend it to be, you can ignore it if
you don't like it, you can be offended if you want to be, or for that
matter you can clean your bedroom in response to what I right.  

My point is that your response is essentially your choice.  There is no
real reason for anyone to be offended who doesn't want to be in the first
place.  In that case, they should thank me for assisting them in the
emotional experiences they are already seeking in their life, although
they would most likely find someone else to be offended by, if not me.

Just thought I'd drop in on this to say that I find this "no need for
copyrights" school of thought to be intriguing, however, it does seem
sort of impractical, somehow. For instance, in a free-copy future,
people would presumably have marketable skills of some sort, there'd
still be an economy. At the same time, it's hard to imagine that the
personal service of signing a book, say, could ever be worth nearly as
much as the book itself, under a copyright system, or that an author
could earn much through putting advertising into his novels, either, if
anyone could freely run any book through an ad filter and then
redistribute it. If the production of a passive artifact, like a book,
is to hold value, and if we want the production of such things to be of
high quality, then wouldn't it be self-defeating to dilute the quality
in favor of forcing the creators out to do something more "active"?

Is it possible that the need for copyrights is being obscured by some of
the language that surrounds the whole idea of "intellectual property"?
For instance, I once read an article many years ago, where the author
was a computer game programmer who complained about how many dollars
every unauthorized copy was "stealing" from him. This struck me as sort
of like being ready to prosecute someone for grand theft auto, because
you saw the bounder taking a photograph of your car! Strictly speaking,
stealing something whose copies are inherently unlimited is a nonsense
proposition -- and maybe we've recognized that, now, in the popularity
of shareware, where copying is not in itself held to be a crime? What
that editorial writer would have thought of the World Wide Web and the
proliferation of shareware is hard to say -- oops, there's another copy
of our product being downloaded, another X dollars lost!

Despite being logical nonsense on the surface, "intellectual property"
appeals to our sense of boundaries, so maybe it's as good a legal
fiction as any for defending copyrights? As long as it's clear that the
only real intent of copyrights is to discourage people from making a
*business opportunity* out of unauthorized copies, I'd have to think of
this as an way to give creators some value for their efforts, through
having some control over their creations. The need for some sort of
business leverage or control seems to be the issue here, not that
different from battles over trademarks, or standing up for proper
attribution of quoted passages, etc?

Why such pesssimism?  The future is certainly not determined already.  I
prefer to belive that people can change their ways, even in ways that
seem drastic.  The coming generations are always a mystery.  The future
is a maze of possibilities to me, and I see that my choices can greatly
influence the way things will go.  The consistent tendencey of humans to
develop better communication abilities is enabling any one individual to
have an ever greater influence over all of Humanity.  That makes
everything quite unpredictable, since I have no idea what some
charismatic genius is planning or even just starting to put into action. 
Just because you haven't come up with a way to modify the behavior of
humans so they no longer destroy the environment doesn't mean that there
aren't thousands of others in the world who may have ideas that will be
very successful.  

Ultimately, you have to decide how much time and effort you want to
invest in developing and carrying out effective solutions to the problems
you seem to be deeply concerned about.  I doubt that giving in to your
pessimism will help you accomplish your goals for the world.

Honestly, I don't come to the same conclusion, from the evidence I see. 
I agree that people are being quite devastating to the biosphere and many
people have strong desires to hurt themselves and their world, but I
think that most of the damage is being done out of ignorance and
adherence to tradition.  Traditions change as each individual decides
what to continue and what to discontinue.  Ignorance can be dealt with in
many ways also.  My favorite is simply giving others honest feedback on
the effects of their actions and making sure there is little they can do
to avoid awareness of the fact that they are destroying much which they
would probably rather not in the long term.

Okay.  So it is trivial for people to earn the money required to provide
their basic needs.  I'll agree with this.

Wait just a minute.  "...and they can be provided by others for free."

Who is "they"?  So I have to earn $1200 a month, $600 for my "basic needs"
and $600 for someone else's basic needs?  How is this supposed to work?
Thanks, but no thanks; I'd just as soon sit around the house and have my
"basic needs" provided for free.  Same benefits, but a lot less work.
"Free" as in "free beer" is an invalid economic construct anyway.

If earning the money required for a persons basic needs is so trivial, then
I can't fathom why anyone else should be allowed to take the money I earn.
Additionally, if the number of people who can't provide for themselves is
so small, I would expect that charity and altruism would pick up the slack
more than adequately.  

How does your idea fit into the real world?  Can you resolve the disparity
between the number of people who can't provide their own basic needs and
the number of people who *choose* not to?  This disparity is the downfall
of most forms of socialism.

I don't know if any virtual realities we create will be as 'real' as our current one, and I am one who spends lots of time working on computers, however I also spend a lot of time in the wilderness, and prefer to live in the country where I can see deer in my yard in the morning. I spend much of my recreational time miles from the nearest computer, and far outside cell phone range. My cabin got running water only this past year (and its still not quite that functional), only has occasional electricity, when I want to cut the silence with the roar of my generator (I'm still shopping solar panels), and internal heat and lighting is propane. Even when I decide to transfer to an android body (which I see as not likely to be necessary given , I can imagine that I will still want to go camping, fishing, and hunting, while not being at all anti-tech.

Yes, the stats showing the relationship between standard of living vs. pollution per capita show that its a bell curve relationship, with the peak at around $10,000.00 per capita. Since there are no civilizations on the planet with more than around $20,000 per capita, we don't know if the curve continues to decrease toward zero, flattens out, or shifts into a new bell curve reflecting a new phase of technological civilization that would be reflected by a shift like the singularity. I would expect that humans in a transhuman/posthuman state, like we see the hi-techers in Vinge's Marooned in Realtime, would have sufficient tech to make a minimum impact upon the environment, if such were a priority for a person seeking to live a more feral existence but with the comforts of high tech.

Depends on what you consider to be the box. I like being human, so much so that I want to be more human, even a perfect human as I see perfection to be. I do plan on augmenting my brain for greater intelligence, knowledge retention and for communicating better, faster, more; achieving immortality, correcting the genetic flaws I've inherited. Technology is meant to serve the human, not the other way around. THAT, IMHO is the essential flaw of the borganist's argument, just as the essential flaw of the socialist is to assume that the purpose of the individual is to serve the community.

Its also to recognize that technology is economically systematized. A technology that is optimally more cost effective than other tech today may no longer be so tomorrow, while that which is not worthwhile today can be the next big thing tomorrow. Bringing a holy war of technological correctness to science and technology is counterproductive. Centralized, standardized science and technological development is as stupid as central state control of an economy.

As per my prior comments on the singularity discussion last year, if someone is calling Transhuman Anders an inhuman creature, that person is far more defining their own level of savagness and obsolescence than making a declarative objective statement about whether Anders is in fact human or not. As far as Anders is concerned, it is he who is human, and the narrow minded luddite is nothing but a monkey still in the trees screeching and throwing doo-doo at the tourists. Anders, in his magnanimity and wisdom may in fact regard that monkey as a human being, but not one to be overly concerned about having a rational informed opinion...

If preserving the entire ecology right now means expending resources that will be required to bootstrap civlization into the next level on simple ecology preservation and restoration, I say store the DNA and start strip mining, it can be rebuilt later. Failure to go for infinity now will condemn future generations to a slow descent into hell on earth. Those who are the most virulent tree huggers, and claim to know the most about ecology always seem to me to blithly ignore that the Earth ecology has rebounded from far worse cataclysms in the past than humanity will ever direct upon it. Life is resilient, and evolution is a constantly changing phenomenon. I find the idea of preserving species that exist now at all cost to be totally anathema to the idea of evolution. Survival of the fittest is the rule, nature has no sentiments.

Yes, in this area of New England, which less than 100 years ago was an ecological wasteland, the ecology has rebounded nicely with nothing more from man than to just get out of the way and let it happen. The moose, salmon, mountain lion, and wolves are back, and the deer, bear, and coyote populations are higher than before white man came. We are hunting the moose again (have been for over a decade now) to manage the herd, and restrictions on keeping salmon that are caught are supposed to be lifted in a few years.

Pictures from my great grandfathers day show rivers that were clogged with huge jams of thousands of logs being ferried downstream, scouring up the riverbeds and killing the fish with the tannic acid leaching from the bark. 90% of the land in NH was cleared and farmed with sheep to feed the mills their wool. In 1910 there were less than a dozen moose in the state, now there are over 15,000.

Yes, it is a rather racist and intolerant view of humanity.

Trying to rationalize your busybody attitudes will get you no sympathy here. You should realize by now that your 'I'm only doing this for your own good' statist comments are quite offensive to most of us. Its not you forcing your view on anyone that is offensive, but that your view is that people should be forced to change, as well as your view that anyone who doesn't agree to be forced to change is obviously insane and in need of help. You are hopelessly infected by the statist memes that most of us here deplore.

Again, you're "Oh, innocent me." cop out is a poor rhetorical method.

This depends on your definition of something working. If you mean by
"worked well" that a system of fundamental competition has *existed*
since time immemorial, then fair enough. But does the existence of a
phenomenon, and its stability in self continuation, necessarily mean it
is the right approach? By this logic we should be throwing all our
transhuman goals away, and sticking with tried-and-true, self
perpetuating evolution. After all, its worked well for four and a half
billion years.

The difference is that there are more possibilities now. I do not
suggest socialism; I think that the idea of monolithic governments is
relatively discredited - although that being said, there are some
relatively large (high-taxing) governments in some western countries
which appear to work quite well. 

With the excellent global communication systems which we are just coming
to have now, I think that we could manage a highly decentralised form of
"government", very much more like an anarchy arrangement.

When you don't have enough resources, you don't have enough resources.
If a cooperative group cannot provide a Jupiter-sized brain to some
subset of its members, why could an equivalent capitalist group do any
better? 

Only because someone takes more than his/her fair share, and damn
everyone else. And under capitalism, that person usually gets to keep
what he/she has taken, meaning that shafting the others becomes
permanent.

Who's going to do the shitwork? Well, yes capitalism has an answer to
this too, as you say. The answer is that some poor bugger (or most of
the poor buggers) is going to be given no other option than to do the
crap work.

So capitalism does indeed have the answers to these problems - they are
solved by somebody forcing their will upon somebody else, someone taking
something and someone else going without. Sounds like socialism. Except
the insidious nature of a capitalist system is that the blame for this
is internalised. Instead of "The system took my stuff away and gave it
to someone else", a person ends up thinking "Well, I couldn't compete
and lost my stuff". Or instead of thinking "I have to do this shitwork
because the system made me", we end up with "I have to do this shitwork
to eat because I am a loser".

When we live in groups for our (invidual) greater good, as we do,
sometimes we're going to have to make concessions. Get over it. If
everyone tries to look at everything from an entirely individualistic
viewpoint (I want what I want and that's tough), we have to compete
(fight), and we get winners and losers. If we have to keep doing this
all the time, we all must lose eventually. The idea of civilisation
arose to guard against this I think.

We have a world where entire nations (nations!) are at the mercy of the
ebb and flow of the world market, where the illusion of "freedom =
capitalism" is harder and harder to justify. The world market has become
an economic environment which is uncontrollable by any single group on
the planet. It is chaotic and unpredictable, and it has the power to
overturn economies shorter and shorter periods of time (as
communications get better). You could have been competing as
successfully as you liked in South East Asia before their recent
economic crisis hit, and it wouldn't have helped you survive. We are all
susceptible in such an environment.

It's interesting to see people arguing on one hand that we should shape
our destinies as we see fit, control the universe, relegate nature to
the status of interested observer, then on the other hand argue for an
economic system whose only defense is that it is "human nature", that it
is "natural". Doesn't sound Extropian to me.

You know, certain very famous historical figures have been nailed to
things for suggesting that people were nice to each other for a change.

But I like your work.

I've always been an intelligent and curious entity, and I've always been
fascinated by most aspects of my world.  I've always had a great hunger
for learning, which seems to grow the more I learn.  As a child, I was
always thinking about things and daydreaming.  School usually required
minimal attention, and I spent the seemingly endless hours at my various
desks thinking quietly to myself about all kinds of things and reading,
when I could get away with it. 

My own intelligence has always been a source of fascination for me, and I
have studied it intently, always working to improve on it.  I have always
believed that humans are capable of anything and that because I am a
human, so am I.  My most consistent desires in my life have been to
become as intelligent as possible, to live in a peaceful, prosperous
world and to have others value me as an individual.

I am almost always thinking.  Everything is fascinating to me and every
experience seems to have so many lessons to teach me.  As I've gotten
older, my fascination with the world and the amount that I seem to be
learning from my ordinary experiences seems to be increasing or at least
becoming more meaningful.

My mind seems to be increasingly in brainstorm mode, and a seemingly
endless supply of ideas is almost always flowing through my mind.  I find
it increasingly difficult to do things in conventional ways because I'm
always thinking of improvements to and variations on conventional ways of
thinking and doing things.  

I'm always thinking of inventions and different ways of doing things. 
I'm always thinking of new and more useful ways to think about things. 
I'm always looking for new problems to solve, to keep my mind busy.  The
process never stops (and I don't really want it to).  

Basically, I have more ideas than I could possibly use myself.  I think
of all kinds of inventions and business plans and fun activities,
interesting problems, etc.  I just love coming up with this stuff, and I
can do it all day with little effort.

Because I come up with so many ideas that I think others could benefit
from, I have decided it would be worthwhile to give them away in order to
further my goal of living in a peaceful prosperous world.  To me, that is
a good trade.  Currently, I want to develop more outlets for sharing my
ideas with others.  Eventually, I would like to have a website where
people could access my ideas and contribute their own.  

If anyone could assist me in this endeavor, I would certainly appreciate
it.  Basically, I want to go public with my ideas so that I and many
others can cash in on the investment I have made in my own intelligence
throughout my life.

Thank you for your assistance.

Mike Lorrey reveals,

"Its not you forcing your view on anyone that is offensive, but that your
view is that people should be forced to change, as well as your view that
anyone who doesn't agree to be forced to change is obviously insane and
in need of help. You are hopelessly infected by the statist memes that
most of us here deplore."

I don't recall ever advocating forcing anyone to change.  For whatever
reason (perhaps you guys could tell me) I am being interpreted in a way
that is very different from how I actually am.  I have always expressed
that I think it is wrong to force others to do things; I always prefer
using persuasion and giving people what they want in exchange for what I
want.  

I never expressed nor do I feel that people who disagree with me are
"obviously insane".  I realize that disagreements are an inevitable
result of having unique ways of thinking and having access to different
information and ideas.

I haven't noticed that I am hopelessly infected by "statist memes"; I
deplore them as much as anyone on this list.

I feel like a straw man about to be burned at the stake by you guys.

Please consider that perhaps I am not really the statist bastard you are
trying to make me out to be. 

Thank you.

Because it would be nice to have a life where I didn't have to spend half

created by those policies. Unfortunately I can't, because more and more of

Now maybe it's just that I'm not schizophrenic, but your four comments
here are clearly contradictory. According to you, if I believe in property
rights, I'm like a child who needs a psychological crutch and has no
control whatsoever of my life. Gosh, how respectful of you. Thanks a bunch.

Uh, because you can't eliminate property rights without forcing me to do
so as well? Because you can't have a society where everyone gets everything
for free without forcing us to work for you? Because communism and socialism
are totally impossible on a large scale without coercion?

Indeed. And if you throw out your silly utopian dreams you'll do a lot better

Pot meet Kettle. Kettle meet Pot. You seem to be projecting all your faults

that is the best Toohey I've read since Rand.

So which is it? In one paragraph you claim that eliminating copyright is
impractical, in the other you claim that copyright on digital data is
nonsense... as we're saying.

>At the same time, it's hard to imagine that the

>much as the book itself, 

I've known several authors in the past, and none of them were ever able to
live solely on the proceeds from book sales; AFAIR they got around $0.50
per book, with the vast majority of the purchase price going to the store
which sold it and the publisher. If people are willing to pay the author
an extra dollar for a signed copy, then the signature is worth far more
to the author than the book was.

But more importantly, you're ignoring the economics of digital distribution.
Suppose I want a copy of the latest novel by Joe Blow; what do I do: go to
www.joeblow.com and pay $0.50 for a copy direct from them, or go to Usenet,
post asking if someone has a copy to send to me and then arrange for them
to email it? I don't know about you, but I earn more than $0.50 every
minute, so it's literally not worth my time to bother trying to avoid paying
that price. And, incidentally, all the software I write is given away free
on the Web... works for us.

The only real benefit of copyright laws is to the publishers, the stores
and the few Stephen Kings of the world who can make millions from their 
work because of it. To the vast majority of authors, copyright is essentially
irrelevant, because their books are so rare that it's just easier to buy 
them than try to get a copy from someone else. Same for the music business,
where the economics are even worse for bands than for authors. 

>As long as it's clear that the
>only real intent of copyrights is to discourage people from making a
>*business opportunity* out of unauthorized copies

I don't have a particular problem with laws against *selling* unauthorized
copies, but that's an entirely seperate issue. I have no problem at all with
laws against selling unauthorized copies and claiming that they're 
authorized copies, but that's just plain old fraud.

I mean it's got us from microscopic organisms to smart apes who can get
off the planet, without stagnating or wiping ourselves out. In that sense
it's worked well; there may be better approaches, but so far we haven't
seen one.

No, you just need to demonstrate something better. So far every attempt 
has been a dismal failure and wasted billions of lives.

>Do you steal books from your local library?

No, but a lot of people do, particularly CDs and videos (my girlfriend
works in a library, so I get to hear the complaints). Libraries are fine
for people who respect property rights, but as soon as someone comes along
who doesn't respect property rights all that 'free' stuff starts to 
vanish.

Such as? You have a free market or you have central planning or you have
some bastardized system in between. What other possibilities are there?

This depends on your definition of something working. I'd like to see some
examples of how these governments work well.

Yes. Now explain how you can have an anarchy which restricts property
rights and free market transactions?

If I remember correctly, the original comment was something about how the
world at its current state could give everyone everything they wanted.
Clearly it can't. Of course a capitalist group would try hard to provide
a Jupiter-sized brain because they could make a profit at it.

>Only because someone takes more than his/her fair share, and damn
>everyone else.

Ah, and so we have to go to the Glorious Socialist Fair Share Determination
Committee so we can determine what my fair share is, I suppose? And if, oddly,
the GSFSD committee members decide that their fair share is ten times as 
large as mine, that'll be OK, right?

I work for a living, providing services which help many others improve their
lives. How exactly am I "shafting" them?

No, that's communism and socialism, or at least communism and socialism
as practiced in the real world; every person an obedient little cog in
the social machine, with their life pretty much determined from birth. In
capitalism we say "ok, someone has to clean the sewers, who's willing to
do it for $1 an hour? $5? $10?" and eventually someone stands up and offers
to do it for a mutually acceptable price. Cleaning the sewers still isn't
nice, but either we come to an agreement somewhere or it doesn't get done.
No-one is forced to do it.

>So capitalism does indeed have the answers to these problems - they are

Sorry, but this is utter crap. In authoritarian societies (e.g. all those
high-taxing socialist societies you like), someone takes something and 
someone else goes without. In capitalism both parties get something they
want (e.g. I get my sewers cleaned and the cleaners get money to do what
they want to do).

Again, nonsense. The free market (everyone wins) is far less hostile
than authoritarian societies (the government wins, everyone else loses).
I win every day by making money to spend on my desires, the company wins
by making profits, the customers win by getting something which is useful
to them, our competitors win because our competition forces them to release
better products which take some of our market share until we next pass them.
Who loses? Whereas the government wins by stealing 50% of my income, and I 
lose by having the government (or the Glorious Central Social Planning 
Committee or whatever you want to call it) steal 50% of my income.

No, it arose to allow the rich to steal from the poor and justify it, just
as socialism allows the politicians to steal from the poor and justify it.

As they should be. The freer the market, the better nations do, it's those
who try to prop up their economies artificially until their denial of
reality reaches catastrophic proportions who have problems.

Yes. Great, isn't it? I just wish that Soros had been able to kick the
UK out of the ERM back in the early nineties before I lost my job due 
to the vastly overpriced currency, rather than after. The government were
destroying the British economy trying to sustain their stupid policies,
and the market saved the economy by destroying their fantasies.

Yep. And most of that was due to corrupt governments attempting to 
artificially prop up their economies, not due to the EVIL WORLD MARKET. 
You can prop up any system of government you like for a while, but
eventually reality catches up with you. Governments really hate that, 
but that's tough luck to them.

No, the defence is:

a) it's what people do when they're free
b) you can't be free if you don't have a free market
c) it works better than anything else that's ever been tried

A desire for a free market is a natural consequence of a desire for
freedom; it's that simple. If you're not free to do what you want with 
your life and your possessions, then you're not free.

My refusal to commit violence upon you is part of my nature; you need
not bargain for it.  Your refusal to commit violence upon me is something
I require from you unconditionally, and will not pay for.  As for trading
"my willingness to find cooperative solutions to our conflicting desires"
for yours, that's exactly what I propose too.  That cooperative solution
is called free trade.  In what way is free trade, mediated by property
rights, not precisely what you say you want--a cooperative solution to
conflicting desires?  What other cooperative solution to conflicting
desires has ever existed, or might exist?

If everyone on the planet is an uploaded entity in a big network, then
perhaps we could just all enter our desires and our talents into a big
database, and the computers would calculate how each of us could get
everything ey wants for the least effort.  But in the world we are in,
with limited information and communication, there's a simple expedient
that accomplishes nearly the same thing--money.  We just use allow all
free individuals to place relative measures on their desires and talents,
and let them engage in free trade by unanimous consent, and it all works
out without the need for central planning.  It's really quite an
ingenious solution to the problem.

Someone pointed out to me a long time ago the comparatively gentle and

the Homo sapien need for utilitarian violence in the hunt, therefore do not
carry  predation into social action with regular folks. I find his view
compelling, and years of observation bear it out. Likewise, athletic experts
in the martial arts, having satisfied the urge for combative contact in a
socially acceptable way, display the least propensity for conflict, i.e.,
they don't seem to have a confrontative bone in their bodies. The wisdom of

Don't forget that most of the world seeks to rise to the level of $10,000.00
per capita populations. To do so, they'll have to deplete five times more
resources than developed nations have already done.

I'll drink to that! I think you've nailed the essential difficulty here...
and the dangerous part of the hypertechnocratic experiment. To the extent
Homo sapiens serves technology, rather than the reverse, we risk unleashing
a Frankensteinian superorganism. Not that it would have diabolical
superintelligence. No, it would not need that to wreck global havoc. Look
what the superorganism called Nazism did... and without the kind of
technology you mention. (Wilson, the biologist, also classifies religions as
superorganisms.)

Yes, "as stupid" and probably a lot more dangerous. Real science continues
to rely on peer review, critical analysis, and the occasional reality check
or wake up call. Wilson notes that scientists use imagination to create
science, and level-headed reason to test it, to verify it, and to make it

Let's not allow our emotions to subvert our science. I don't have much use
for "tree huggers" either (virulent or otherwise). Rhetoric in the pursuit
of extremism does not constitute a virtue. We have only one Earth. No one
owns the whole thing, and no one has the right to deplete it for whatever
ideology they favor. It doesn't make sense to kill the canary that might
warn of danger in the mine. (The dead canary's DNA can't serve the same
purpose.)

populations are higher than before white man came. We are hunting the moose
again (have been for over a decade now) to manage the herd, and restrictions
on keeping salmon that are caught are supposed to be lifted in a few years.


Excellent start. Now we just need to do the same for South America, Africa,

We used this series in college.  With Feynman I often found that the
chapters were easy to read and it seemed like I was following him, but
it was hard to apply what I had learned.  I seem to recall that there
was a separate book of exercises, perhaps by Leighton, cross-referenced
to his chapters?  I can't seem to find it online.  Maybe available from
the Caltech bookstore.

The MTW Gravitation is nice because it is marked into two tracks, and you
can stick with track one which gives you a good feel for the subject.

More accessible though is Spacetime Physics, by Taylor and Wheeler, which
discusses special relativity.  Like the MTW book it takes a geometric
approach.  It turns out that velocity boosts are exactly the same as
coordinate axis rotations, except using hyperbolic geometry rather
than Euclidian.  They have a lot of exercises to help pin down your
understanding, including discussions of many of the traditional paradoxes.

I agree that C++ is too messy and that Java is superior.  Personally I
would start with Java since that way you are working with objects from
the beginning; you would find it easy to then move to C since the syntax
is 80% the same.  Plus with Java you can make cool web applets from the
start.  I'm not sure what the best Java development system is though;
it would depend on your host.  But there are a lot of recommendations
online.

I'm sure you'll do well whatever path you follow.  It sounds like you
are off to a great start.  Don't forget to spend some time enjoying
life; learning is fun but there are a lot of other fun things to do in
your teens.

That does not follow, since it is not really a function of per capita
income but rather technology. If you build a steelwork or chemical
factory based on modern principles rather than old principles it
becomes more efficient and less polluting. That means, if developing
nations get the chance to build these modern systems (which do not
necessarily have to be much more expensive), then there is no need to
deplete much.

Maybe the best thing to do for the environment would be to export or
give China, Indonesia, India and similar nations as much advanced
technology as possible, making them jump past the most crude and
polluting stages. Partially this appears to have happened in some of
the south-east asian countries, but never completely. And of course a
lot of politics gets in the way - I guess most Americans would not
want to see their nation *help* another become a great power, even if
they would in the long run gain on it.

So who are we arguing against? If we look at the extropian principles
or transhumanist statement, it is clear that neither approves of
humans serving technology. Technocracy goes directly against the
extropian style.

It would be nice to see this approach applied to other areas more,
both economics, politics and society as a whole. Just imagine the
results when people could empirically compare the effects of different
policies in a clear manner.

I should amend my earlier statement. Not only has Homo sapiens begun the
process of global suicide (he didn't actually "decide" to do it -- he just
doesn't comprehend the consequence of his instinctually-driven ideology), he
has also begun the process of collective denial combined with a
determination to keep up appearances. Ubiquitious self-medication and drug
abuse in the West constitutes one symptom of this collective malady. In the
words of an earlier contributor to this list, "Anaesthetic offenses numb the
best defenses."

No problem.  The myth of limited natural resources has been debunked so
thoroughly on so many occasions that it is amazing anyone with any sense
could still believe it.  I highly recommend Julian Simon's works for a
detailed look at why the meme of limited resources doesn't describe the real
world.

So, we must preserve everything as it is or suffer dire consequences?
Someday we'll need those snail darter?  You should know better than that.
This whole idea was dreamed up by people who worship nature (often
literally) as an excuse to justify their desire to sacrifice humanity on the
alter of conservation.

There is no good reason to believe that their concerns are real.  The
species that we actually depend on for survival are in no danger at all.
Exotic species have some limited significance as sources for new drugs, but
that is rapidly diminishing as our ability to design such things improves.
The only real risks I see are to the tourism industries of the third world.

There are real arguments to be made in favor of ecological preservation, but
they rest purely on moral and/or esthetic grounds.  From a purely pragmatic
viewpoint, we can convert the entire planet into farms, ranches and shopping
malls without endangering ourselves in the slightest.

I would say that is up to the South Americans, the Africans, and the Asians.
In purely practical terms, the only thing we could do about it is conquer
them and force them to do things our way - something I doubt any of us would
support.

You're welcome to try and persuade them to clean up their act, of course,
and I wish you luck.  However, you ought to recognize the fact that is where
the battle is - America and Europe already believe in conservation, and we
already devote more resources to such projects than can be justified on
purely practical grounds.

> "racist"? What a stretch! You've gone silly on me..

I doubt it applies to you, but it does accurately describe the ideas of many
influential Green thinkers.  They hate humanity, and believe that animals
and plants are morally superior beings.  They believe that human needs must
be sacrificed in a quest to preserve every ecological system on Earth in a
state of eternal stasis, no matter what the cost to us may be.  If that
isn't racism (or, to turn around one of their favorite terms, "speciesism"),
what is?

Exactly. This is the core of the information economy, and why it is so
different from traditional economics: we become wealthier the more we
give away. Unlike the traditional material economies where altruism by
necessity had a negative utility for oneself, here it can have zero or
a positive utility, making it more likely.

A kind of ideas bank? I think there are some on the net already, but
the idea itself can likely be developed.

I'm not sure I could contribute to setting up the website (too much to
do), but I sure would contribute some ideas and discussion.

I think this is the way to go. Especially wind-up satelite
phones. Wind-up PCs and phones are more liberating here than TVs and
radios, since broadcasting is still a centralized process. Free access
to information and communication is a very liberating technology that
makes many current dictatorships untenable or at least weaker. It
doesn't necessarily topple them (that is in the end up to the
citizens) but it gives more power and ability to the individual
people.

Of course, dumping stuff like this is no miracle cure, you need to
provide good information through it, ideally ensure that the users can
control their own information and set up their own (virtual)
institutions. 

In the case of Serbia (not that I have the least interest in debating
that affair), there seems to be some evidence that most of the
population is being fed a highly biased view of what is happening
through state media (unlike us, who just get biased media - but at
least can choose between them :-) and are actually quite misinformed
about what is happening. Here widespread access would undermine the
propaganda. But it wouldn't necessarily change the core problem;
people in Greece, who have access to much freer information, are still
strongly pro-Serbian (for historical, political and cultural
reasons). People won't turn into rational, nice people by having
communications technology - but it likely makes it harder to suppress
rationality and easier to get useful information to and from
elsewhere.

This sounds like the world famous brand of american ethnocentrism
talking. Travel more, the world is a much more sophisticated place
then we normally think here in the U.S. I'm not throwing stones, I
see this lacking in myself as well.

television. There's nothing like it to promote longing in people

Actually, it is just the opposite.  It is a recognition of the fact that
people in the rest of the world have their own cultures, philosophies and
opinions about how things should be done.  They aren't going to turn their
lives upside down just because the American government (or the Europeans, or
the UN) wants them to.

If you believe, for example, that the destruction of the Brazilian rain
forest is evil and stupid, it does no good to rail against it to an audience
of Americans.  There is precious little we can do about it without resorting
to a massive application of force.  The people you need to convince live in
Brazil, and that is where you need to concentrate your efforts.

You should also recognize that the situation calls for more than just
proselytizing.  Most of the environmental degradation in the Third World is
not caused by evil western corporations trying to get rich on the backs of
the poor.  Instead, it is caused by huge numbers of impoverished people
trying to survive as best they can.  Telling them to stop will do no good -
they aren't going to let their children go hungry to preserve a few more
acres of forest.  What you need to do is give them an alternative way of
providing for themselves that doesn't destroy the land.

Of course, trying to actually do something effective about the situation
leads to a whole nest of practical problems, but that is a different issue.

Law enforcement agencies are moving to trucked commnication systems and 
radio scanners will incorporate trunk tracking as well. The H.R. 514, 
"Wireless Privacy Enhancement Act of 1999" will make it illegal for 
manufactureres to sell such equipment, or to sell any devices that "convert 
protected paging service transmissions to alphanumeric text." This bill is 
what the Feds are offering to enhance our privacy in lieu of strong 
encryption systems that they would have difficulty cracking. In other words: 
they can listen to us, but we can't listen to them. The bill is currently 
winding its way through Congress and will almost certainly become a law 
unless people make a fuss. You can read the bill at:

http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c106:H.R.514

they are go to:

Ah, amazing the sort of knee jerk reactions you can get to semantically 'hot' words. IMNSHO, it is as racist to regard an artificial intelligence as a) an inhuman unnatural object, and b) automatically a threat based on prejudice (a), as it is to regard someone of another color, religion, gender, or ethnicity as an inhuman or less than human and therefore a threat. Both reactions are pure xenophobia. Not very enlightened of you, J.R.

"To What End?," asks the biologist Wilson. "It is the custom of scholars
when addressing behavior and culture to speak variously of anthropological
explanations, psychological explanations, biological explanations, and other
explanations appropriate to the perspectives of individual disciplines. I
have argued that there is intrinsically only one class of explanation. It
traverses the scales of space, time, and complexity to unite the disparte
facts of the disciplines by consilience, the perception of a seamless web of
cause and effect." p. 266

You've made an illogical surmise. No one has implied that "we must preserve
everything as it is."
Read _Consilience_, then check back.

Concerns come from real people. You need not believe in the reality of real
people's concerns. But I hope you had no trouble believing your mother's

The arguments made for saving the life of planet Earth concern me less and
less as I witness the misdirection of intelligence that social engineering
has wrought. Try converting the Sahara desert or the Antarctic to farmland.
Then check back with me. (But not before.)

Yes, like we can leave it up to the Albanians, the Bosnians, the Haitians,

I doubt they ( the South Americans, the Africans, and the Asians) would

I hadn't considered the "influential Green thinkers." But now that you
mention it, yes, I see what you mean. Yes, those knuckleheads do cloud the
issues of import. Rest assured that the foothills of the Sierras and
Cascades (where I've lived these many years) don't harbor those kind. We've
mostly loggers and cowboys out here. And yes, I suppose quite a few of them
qualify as racists. Consequently, I don't go to the bars around here
(anymore).

If you ever find yourself in Northern California (Shasta county,
specifically), please stop by for a cold beer. We need people like you
around here.

Well, this has some implications.  It would seem unconstitutional.
Here is the issue, there is never a reason for anyone to listen to anyone else's
conversation unless they are directly involved in the conversation or it is a
public broadcast.

Law enforcement should be able to get access to telephone conversations and data
transfer if they have a warrant, but not otherwise.  To observe any telephone
conversation besides one's own and those that one has a privilege to observe
given by the people in a conversation, is a violation of rights.  Any time there
becomes government recording, there is to be notification.

When talking to service representatives of the phone company, you are notified
that the conversation is being recorded and then it is clear.  Any other
recording is a rights violation.

There is not reason for the equipment actually used to perform wiretaps to not
be available to law enforcement, but there should be checks and balances on its
use just like any other use of it.

These checks and balances should be available to be publicly monitored.  What
this would mean is that the prima facie elements of a case would have to be
established before any wiretapping.  Then, a warrant could be aquired,
conventionally, through a judge, then it would be constitutional to wiretap
someone.  To be actually constitutional, it might be necessary for there to be
notification.

I hope for your sake you use accurate figures. (The current state of my

The technology the US gave to Japan 70 years ago didn't really play out all

"Nice" you say? It would constitute a major change in human societal
evolution.
If you imagine the results when people empirically compare the effects of
different policies in an objective manner, you imagine consilience.

UCSC's INVENTON Software Creates Molecules in 3D
by Elisabeth Wechsler
A software package under development at the University of California, Santa
Cruz (UCSC) uses artificial intelligence techniques and a knowledge of
chemistry to "invent" molecules in 3D space -- something that has been
lacking to date, according to Professor Todd Wipke, of UCSC's Molecular
Engineering Laboratory.

"Chemists have no good algorithms for manually enumerating the molecules
that can satisfy a set of constraints in 3D," he said, in his March 5th
presentation at the NAS Computational Molecular Nanotechnology Workshop.
Wipke believes that "computers, when properly programmed, [can] be more
creative than chemists in the task of inventing new chemical structures."

Called INVENTON, the program automatically constructs chemical frameworks
that position atoms in a desired 3D arrangement, giving researchers new
ideas for building blocks. Wipke summarized the paradigm as: "Chemist
describes objectives and constraints. Computer formulates strategy and
tactics, then invents structures and ranks them. Chemist reviews resulting
candidates." More specifically, INVENTON creates molecules by adding
molecular fragments to span the space from one point to another. The points
are given in the problem description provided by the chemist or are
generated as subgoals. The molecular fragments come from a basis set
established by the investigator. INVENTON also can build structures from
individual atoms. Finally, the program ranks the candidate structures by
scoring functions selected by the chemist, Wipke explained.


Productive Approach To Design
"A computer program can invent molecules that have never been conceived of
and do not exist in any database anywhere," he commented. In its six years
of existence, INVENTON has designed structures in the domains of
nanotechnology (self-assembling molecules in nanoscale systems) and
pharmaceutical drugs (such as mimics of known drugs for cancer and enzyme
inhibitors for AIDS).
"Designing a system like this is a complex task -- one that requires really
logical thinking. AI methods are already being used by INVENTON to
prioritize tasks, and heuristic search is used to reduce the number of
`relevant' constraints." In addition, bringing "engineering principles
across boundaries to assist chemical design" has been useful, Wipke noted.

Automated molecular design will benefit from greater CPU speed, more
knowledge and understanding, and larger organized collections of chemical
information readable by computer, he said, adding that "having more complex
problems will accelerate our abilities to problem solve."


Collaboration with NAS
Collaborative work between Wipke's group at UCSC and Al Globus (NAS
applications and tools group) has included modifications to the search
strategy and solving simple initial problems. Current work is focused on
developing fragment libraries designed for nanotechnology and then applying
them to problems requiring very stiff molecules. A more difficult future
problem is taking advantage of the high degree of symmetry common in
nanotechnology problems and spanning space with molecular fragments that can
be repeated an indefinite number of times.

Yes, indeed. Power to the people puts the idea of immortality (can you live
forever?) in perspective.
But who gets to decide who will live forever? Obviously not everyone will
get to decide for themselves.

Do virtual institutions have less trouble setting up than other institutions
do? I ask because several of my correspondents deny that virtual categories
exist at all. (So far I've managed to ignore or sidestep them.)

They probably won't turn their lives around for extropianism either. Unless
we can provide some hard evidence that we've got something they can't do
without (for instance the ability to live forever). Otherwise, they'll fight
us with the same ferocity that they used against other invading ideologies.

Exellent point. Brazilia stands as a monument to the idiocy of ideological
excess -- not to mention its negative impact on the environment.

Right on. The concept of  Overpopulation does not register with them.

Different issues ought not to faze those who aspire to living forever, ought
they?

Hi,

About personal privacy, as often, I have some comments about what I just
wrote.

Well, that statement might seem a bit extreme.  By the same token,
people do not
know how much of what they think is private is not, and it should be
carefully
disclosed to them.

Maybe it is more so than any copying other than the original copy is
unconstitutional.  I mean, if it is a machine, not a human, and left
there with
the common expectation of being an answering machine, and someone leaves
a
message, that's totally constitutional.

All this machinery runs on equipment by people.

I think good government is a good thing.  I think it is good to advocate
good
government.

I like reading about Congress and the laws, they define how a
cooperative and
competitive society works.

Huh.  It's a good thing that we have a vigilant populace.  That way, can
observe
our open government.  Also, we can ensure, through our vote, and
campaign
contributions, public and popular interest in terms of our
representatives in
government.

'Manually'? Isn't there such a thing a combinatorial explosion? Are we

building molecular models  and docking them by hand?

All this is not exactly new. Look at Gasteiger's work, for

They don't tell whether the system does learn progressively or has to

Designer Molecules: Largest Protein Ever Created From Scratch Has 
Implications For Novel Drug Delivery And Diagnostics
For the last decade, scientists have been trying to accurately synthesize 
substances with shapes that mimic biological molecules, specifically 
proteins that drive important biochemical pathways in humans. So far, these 
attempts have made moderate strides, both in terms of size of the designed 
protein and the precision with which it folds from a string of amino acids 
to its final three-dimensional structure. Now, researchers at the University 
of Pennsylvania Medical Center have created the largest protein from 
scratch, with both a stable and predictable shape.
"The ability to do this really takes us out of the realm of tinkering with 
existing proteins to engineering entirely new proteins and polymers," says 
senior author William F. DeGrado, Ph.D., professor of biochemistry and 
biophysics. "We have shown that it is now possible to design a protein with 
a well-defined three-dimensional structure." The Penn group's findings 
appear in the May 11 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of 
Sciences.

DeGrado notes that implications of this advance in protein design could be 
as broad as those for natural proteins -- from manufacturing entirely new 
polymers for industrial catalysts to creating new pharmaceuticals.

To design a protein, scientists generally work backwards from nature in a 
two-step process. They first choose an existing three-dimensional protein 
structure and then, using complex computer programs, find a new sequence of 
amino acids that folds into the same shape as the natural protein. The Penn 
team's approach is one step removed from that. "We asked: Can we generate 
proteins that are inspired by nature but have no direct natural 
equivalent?," explains DeGrado.

The protein -- called alpha-3D -- was designed, produced, and characterized 
by Scott Walsh, a doctoral student in DeGrado's lab. Alpha-3D is a bundle of 
three counterclockwise-coiling helices whose general shape was inspired by a 
protein found in the common household bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. 
Alpha-3D is also three times larger than previously synthesized proteins.

"By designing larger proteins, we can make them more stable and thus easier 
to manipulate," says Walsh. The next step will be to build a specific 
function into the protein's structure. Currently, Walsh is retooling the 
surface of alpha-3D to cause it to bind to a variety of hormonal receptors. 
Natural proteins that do this are expensive to produce and suffer from 
limited shelf lives. Novel mimics of these proteins may have enhanced 
stability and potency.

This work was conducted in the Johnson Research Foundation, a funding and 
research organization within Penn's Department of Biochemistry and 
Biophysics that concentrates on the study of physics as it applies to 
medicine.

I was quite intrigued when I first heard of Apple's project and look forward to trying a production model out, despite my bias against being categorized with the newbie/aol set that still thinks that "Macs Rule!".

I dunno about a wind up one. I think matching a conventional one with a solar, wind, or micro-hydro setup would be sufficient, though I can foresee a business that is a combination health club/ISP, where the members keep the network running.... Apparently recent tests of stationary bike controlled TV's are having a positive impact on personal fitness...

Sometimes analogies can have a truth to them that goes beyond what
literally makes sense -- perhaps I didn't make that perfectly clear,
before. If company X develops an information product, named "Y", only to
have that product stolen by a free riding competitor, then in such a
case the word "stolen" doesn't really have its most usual meaning, i.e.,
the meaning of corporation X being deprived of the use of something
*tangible*. In effect, the complaint of the "X" folks would be that
their expense in developing product "Y" has been ruined, as the market
has been taken over, effortlessly, by someone else, thus leaving no one
with any real incentive to make the effort of developing such products
in the future. What's really been stolen is something intangible, namely
the market for a product that wouldn't have existed without company X,
and *yes*, it certainly can work out that X is deprived of a market,
which should have been theirs!

The point is, the "X" people may have a valid claim by reason of having
made a specific investment in creating information that people are
willing to buy. Thus, the use of words like "steal" and "pirate" for
copyright infringements -- and, again, note the limitations of the
analogy between stealing an actual "something" on the one hand and
"stealing" a marketable info package on the other. If an end user copies
an info package for a friend, he can give it away, and keep it, both,
but it certainly isn't clear if he's "cut into" a well deserved "company
X market" by that act alone.

Suppose your very first search for this novel turns up a "pirate" site
that gives away the novel for free, or perhaps just at the cost of
viewing an ad or two -- and, say it's unauthorized and returns no cash
to the author? Wouldn't you see that as cutting into a legitimate market
"turf" for the writer and/or his business associates, perhaps even to
the point of discouraging any further quality writing in that type of
market?

As for free software, I don't know your business situation, but if you
can put out handy and useful information for free, and make money on
associated needs or services, then more power to you. I'd still have to
think there might also be a need for marketable info -- so are you
saying that you wish to take something away from the marketers of
shareware, let's say?

Isn't a law against selling unauthorized copies just the same thing as
copyright law, to all practical intents and purposes? If unauthorized
copying for the sake of making commerce is a crime and a fraud, why
then, we are quite in agreement, it would seem! Myself, I can make fun
of attitudes that seem to take "piracy" too literally, but I can still
see that there's probably a legitimate business rationale for preventing
fraudulent copying. What I like to see, really, is the use of technology
and business to actually develop things that people need or want, but
stealing away the results of some particular marketable effort wouldn't
seem to advance that end.

UCLA or Davis?  Basic enough, right?  I need to decide which one I'd like to 
go to by June 1st.  I'd really appreciate any advice or recommendations.  My 
major is philosophy (I plan to focus on logic, analytic philosophy, and 
philosophy of science).  I've already finished my first two years of general 
ed. so I'll be jumping into my major related work right away this fall.  
Thanks in advance for any helpful suggestions, as I know there are sure to 
be some.

Actually, there is one thing you can do: buy the rain forests. Of course,
that would require that the eco-fanatics spend some of their own money,
whereas they only like to spend other peoples'.

*** << END
Lloyd Said:  No, F. Mann, you are missing the point entirely in an
ultra-reductionist, nominalist manner.

Mann Responded:  You made certain points which set me thinking, resulting
in my making different points, because I don't agree with
your points. To jump to the conclusion that I "missed
your point" because I made different points is fallacious
thinking.

Lloyd Sez:  No, I challenged your ideas and instead of
arguing effectively, you simply restated your opions which
I already read and understood.

Mann Said:  To achieve level-3 freedom it's imperative that you develop
the thinking skills and virtues of ultra-reductionism and
nominalism.

Lloyd Sez:  No, ultra-reductionism considers personal
identity and consciousness to be illusions.  Nominalism
is a dead end that ultimately denies approaching truth
through the scientific method.

Mann Said:  (I'm not suggesting that you even attempt to
advance to level-3 freedom. That may not be appropriate
for you. But this discussion may assist others to advance
to level-3 freedom.)

Lloyd Sez:  The above is a silly, gratuitous insult.  The argument
from intimidation.

Mann Said:  From a level-3 perspective the "Vatican social organism"
notion is a negative peme (and "reme" = religious meme)
in your head. The basic mental mechanism which gives
rise to such pemes/remes is anthropomorphism --
'#TL05AB: ANTHROPOMORPHISM AND RELATED PHENOMENA'
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl05ab.htm>.


Lloyd Responds:  The Vatican Social Organism is a meme complex in the
mind of its members, those individuals subsumed and controlled
by the Vatican meme broadcasters.  In my mind it is a theory about
a possible external existent.  Recognizing that a macrobe or social
organism exists is not the same as being captured in its meme field.

Lloyd Goes On to Say:  Anthropomorphism can be a useful heuristic method in
developing and
clarifying hypotheses and theories.  I agree that it does not prove the
truth of any particular theory.  Only the scientific method can increase
or decrease an individual's confidence that a theory approaches external
truth.

"Lloyd Miller" <lloyd@a-albionic.com>:

    Mr. Mann, I wrote all this to counteract your
assumption that collectives are delusional. Contrary
to what you have written, the individualist need not
deny the reality of collectives in order to refuse to
be part of them. Because the collective's pemes and
memes are real in the minds of others the collectives
are also real. The individualist need not join in.
However, this is not easy and requires a lifelong struggle
as one can unconsciously accept many memes and pemes.
People are born in collectives and rapidly become
infested with the memes propagated by the collective's
memetic field. Only after decades of stuggle a la
Gurdjieff can anyone hope to be an individual in direct
contact with the evidence of reality, unfiltered by the
social organism.

  Denial of the objective existence of collectives is
denial of reality, often a vain positing of one's own
individuality....just as the individual has a reality
beyond the reality of electro-chemically manipulated
cells and organs, collectives have an existence beyond
the actions of individuals human beings, including
"Masters" or the "Ruling Class."

  By the way, it is nearly universal that individualists
have considered collectives delusional a la Stirner
though without being as thorough going. I say unto you:
Pretending collectives don't exist doesn't work.

>    Mr. Mann, I wrote all this to counteract your
>assumption that collectives are delusional.

Mann Responds:  The above isn't my assumption. That which I contend is
illusional occurs in people's heads. In other words, it's
not "collectives" which are illusional. It's the *notions*
in people's heads about certain "collectives existing" --
or even being volitional entities -- that are illusions.

Lloyd Responds:  I never said that the mere presence of an
idea of a collective in a person's head means the collective exists.
By the scientific method we can test which social collectives actually
exist by virture of a functioning memetic complex in an operating
set of individual minds.

Lloyd Said Earlier:  Contrary to what you have written, the individualist
need
not deny the reality of collectives in order to refuse to
be part of them.

Mann Responded:  Actually, a distinction needs to be made. I believe that
my body exists as a collective. There are real collectives
and there are illusions in people's heads.

The individual at level-3 freedom realizes that the fact
that millions of people think and behave as if certain
"collectives" are real doesn't make "them" so. From the
level-3 perspective, in these cases, there's nothing to
be part of or not part of. It's an issue of ceasing to
think, communicate, and behave like the ontological
collectivists (but pretending to do so, when that's
deemed appropriate).

Lloyd Responds:    As I stated before, if a set of individuals
are significantly manipulated by a meme complex which
issues from the power center of a social organism, ie. like
the Vatican, Washington, Grand Lodge of the Masons, etc.
then, I am arguing, that social organism exists.  As an individualist,
however, of course, I can refuse to be part of it...I can say no
to the Borg....there is no need to deny its existence to be free
of its memes.  Of course, my idea or theory about the existence
of any particular macrobe could be wrong.  As with any theory
only the scientific method can increase or decrease my confidence
about the possible existence of any particular macrobe.  For instance,
I am far more confident that the Vatican and Washington centered
macrobes exist than I am of the Grand Lodge of England Masonic
macrobe, to say nothing the the mythical [in my opinion]  "Bavarian
Illuminati" macrobe.

Lloyd Said Earlier:  Because the collective's pemes and memes are real in
the
minds of others the collectives are also real.

Mann Responded:  This is a fallacious form of argument and phenomenon known
as hypostatization -- see '#TL07A: The Anatomy of Slavespeak'
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.htm>. It's like arguing
that because people have a "Santa Claus" meme in their heads,
therefore "Santa Claus is real."

Lloyd Responds:  Come on, Mann!  You must know I didn't mean
that any idea in the mind of an individual creates a reality.  Only
the scientific method can increase confidence that ideas have external
referents.

Mann went on to say:  Also it's not the "collective's
pemes and memes"; only individual humans have memes/pemes in
their minds. (Of course, they also record their memes/pemes
and spread them using communication artifices.)

Lloyd Responds:  Fine...that is your theory.  However, I am suggesting
an alternate theory that may explain our sense data better.  The social
organisms (collectives) exist and maintain their power by manipulating its
subsumed
individuals to extend its memes via human communication.  Of course,
I think the social organism establishes, spreads, and protects its meme
structure through human intermediaries....though who knows?  There
could be other mechanisms as well [Subspace signals or Morphic Resonance?]

Lloyd Said Earlier:  The individualist need not join in. However, this not
easy
>and requires a life long struggle as one can unconsciously
>accept many memes and pemes. People are born in collectives
>and rapidly become infested with the memes propagated by the
>collective's memetic field.

Mann Responded:  No. People are born on beds in hospitals and homes
(mostly).
The memes they get infected with are propagated by parents,
teachers, preachers, politicians, journalists, etc. -- i.e.,
by individual human beings (often using communication artifices).

Lloyd Responded:  Your theory.  Mine is that the parents consciously
or unconsciously act as agents for the macrobe in imposing memes
on their offspring.

Lloyd Said Earlier:  Only after decades of struggle a la Gurdjieff can
anyone hope
>to be an individual in direct contact with the evidence of
>reality, unfiltered by the social organism.

Mann Responded:  Reality isn't "filtered by the social organism," but by the
memes/pemes in the individual mind. Maybe further perusal of
'Beelzebub's Tales to his Grandson' (by Gurdjieff), to the
point of overcoming the "kundabuffer" is necessary.

Lloyd Responds:  Gurdjieff mentions in Tales to His Grandson many
times that man unconsciously serves "higher purposes"...in my theory
the social organism, Borg, Macrobe, or Metazon.

Lloyd Said Earlier:  Denial of the objective existence of collectives is
denial
>of reality, often a vain positing of ones own individuality...

Mann Responded:  The level-3 individualist doesn't deny "the objective
existence
of collectives." On the contrary, he contends that the *notion*
of "the objective existence of certain imagined collectives" in
the ontological collectivist's mind is illusional.

Lloyd Responds:  Great!  It is just a matter of determining which ones are
real and
which ones are not.  However, this implies you are really not an
ultra-reductionist
nor a nominalist.

Lloyd Said Earlier:  ...just as the individual has a reality beyond the
reality
>of electro-chemically manipulated cells and organs, collectives
>have an existence beyond the actions of individual human beings,
>including "Masters" or the "Ruling Class."

Mann Responded:  This is a fallacious argument by analogy. The phemomenon of
my
cells, etc. forming a collective known as my body doesn't imply
that the same phenomenon applies to whatever supposed "collectives"
you care to imagine.

Lloyd Responds:  It should be obvious that I was not making an argument,
but only clarifying my theory.  Analogy is a valid heuristic method of
developing
and clarifying hypotheses and theories.  I never meant to imply and analogy
proves anything...it illustrates.  Only the scientific method can increase
or
decrease confidence that a mental representation corresponds to an external
reality

Lloyd Said Earlier:  By the way, it is nearly universal that individualists
>have considered collectives delusional a la Stirner
>though without being as thorough going. I say unto you:
>Pretending collectives don't exist doesn't work.

Mann Responded:  I agree with you that "pretending collectives don't exist
doesn't work." That's why I wouldn't dream of doing so.

In fact, pretending that "collectives exist" is sometimes
necessary for optimum survival. I don't argue with the
armed cop who thinks he's a "government official enforcing
the law." When I think it's appropriate I certainly pretend
that "collectives exist."----Frederick Mann

Lloyd's Final Shot:  Great!  We agree on goals.  I would just
ask you to keep my alternate theoretical framework in mind
and see if it doesn't work better than yours in undestanding
and handling reality.   I don't have to pretend vicious individual
devouring macrobes exist.  I just have to pretend to be part
of them occasionally!
macrobes exist....

The question you'll really have to ask is,

"Do you want fries with that?"

Sorry, that was a cheapshot, but I just couldn't resist ;)

Actually I worded this poorly, it was the opinion you were

Here we are fighting over harvesting the last of the old growth
timber in the U.S., but telling the Brazillian's they must not
harvest all of their's. If I was them, I'd tell us to F*** off.

I don't agree, much of the degradation is related to more advanced
economies utilizing the people and resources of the third world for
their own gain, plus since we don't utilize
environmental/ecological technologies, we're the last one's who
should tell anyone about it. Fortunately South America has an
excellent example of it's own.... Gaviotas.

Agreed, I'm just one of those silly people who's headed for the

anyone interested.   ;)

I agree about the router, my point is that we need to remember that
routers can be small, those of us who manage forests of Cisco 75xx
routers tend to forget that.

The pedal powered T.V. is a great idea, I was unaware anyone had
actually built one. I proposed it a couple of years ago to an
engineer friend who was concerned about his kid not getting enough
exercise, and watching to much T.V. I've always intended to get
around to building one for myself.

Extropy Industries anyone?

Yes.  Of course, I don't think the Brazilian government would let us do it
anyway - they have pretty restrictive views about foreign ownership of
anything that big.

Arguing about the "ends" of an entire civilization is one of the most
useless exercises I can imagine.  Civilizations don't have goals, purposes,
desires or ends - those are attributes of individuals.

If the author seriously believes that resource depletion and ecological
catastrophe are urgent survival issues for mankind, he is so far out of
touch with reality that I'm not particularly interested in his opinions.  If
his book happens to be devoted to proving that we should actually be
concerned about these things (using hard evidence, not anecdotes and
hysteria), I might give it a look just to make sure there isn't some new
evidence I've missed.  If, however, he takes these things as given, then
there is no reason for me to waste my time.

Playing word games does nothing to support your position.  There is no
scientific basis for the belief that current or anticipated levels of
ecological damage pose any danger whatsoever to mankind's survival. If you
(or Wilson) think otherwise, let's see some evidence.

The Antarctic isn't worth bothering with (although we could cover it with
indoor farms and/or hydroponics facilities if we really wanted to).
Irrigating and fertilizing the Sahara would require a few trillion dollars
worth of nuclear power plants, chemical plants and heavy equipment, but it
is perfectly doable.

Of course, this is totally irrelevant to my point, which was that we can
easily survive the destruction of virtually every species of life on the
planet.  All we need for survival is a few hundred species of domestic
animals, a few thousand species of plants, and the various insects and
microorganisms that will naturally survive in any environment where these
species are preserved.

Even the most extreme eco-destruction scenario won't make things as bad as
that.  Relatively modest preservation efforts are enough to ensure that a
large majority of the ecology survives even after an area becomes heavily
populated.  The species that don't make it are not important to our
survival.

Now, as I said before, I don't think that means we should just let
everything die.  It simply means that we must be honest enough to argue for
preservation on moral grounds instead of making up bogus threats.

When I saw the desire was to be "philosophical" (off the
record was my major at University of Denver) I was ready to
say the same thing as Doug, but seriously, I spoke with one
of the students here from California and she indicated that
Davis would be a "nice" place, UCLA might have a good
Philosopy Dept, but the atmosphere will be "large city."
Her recommendation was to check out Santa Cruz, about 1 hour
South of San Francisco.  She said that some of her friends
were Philosophy Majors and they were there.

Just more information to sort through...

Hunters probably do more to preserve resources than do eco-alarmists like Al
Gore. A private group of duck hunters called Ducks Unlimited has reclaimed
or set aside many acres of tule and wetlands in which ducks thrive. Of
course, since we will all have the option of uploading any day now, it
doesn't really matter. We can hunt ducks in the virtual reality of the
Superorganism's brain when we upload ourselves (and the ducks, of course).

The Amazon rain forest is being destroyed by peasants clearing land for
farms.  Wildlife extinction in Africa is largely a result of local farmers
and ranchers clearing out "vermin" to protect their crops and herds
(although foreign hunters are also factor in some cases).  The devastation
on the Indian subcontinent is a direct result of overpopulation.  Most third
World countries don't make any efforts at all to limit pollution, so local
industry tends to be very dirty regardless of who owns it.  Is there some
other area I've missed?

Meanwhile, in America most types of pollution have been decreasing for about
a century now.  We have more mature forest than we did at the turn of the
century, and we've set aside a significant fraction of the country as a
permanent nature preserve.  Every industry in the country is subject to
reams of environmental regulation, and we spend tens of billions of dollars
a year on research aimed at figuring out how to do a better job of
protecting the environment.

To mind, these facts lead inevitably to the conclusion that the real work of
environmentalism is in the third world.  America is in good shape already,
and things will naturally tend to improve as our understanding of
conservation issues increases.  Places like Brazil and Bangladesh, OTOH, are
headed for an experiment in complete ecological destruction if nothing is
done.

The natural question, then, is what can be done?  I see the following
options:
1) We can preach at them.  People in the really poor countries won't listen,
of course, because they can't change what they are doing without starving
themselves.  We might make some headway in South Korea, Taiwan, and other
recently-industrialized nations, but that isn't where the big problems are.

2) We can use treaties, economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure to try to
make problem countries change their ways.  This, of course, is exactly the
kind of paternalistic neo-colonialism that they hate, so it isn't going to
make us any friends.  It also doesn't address the problem, so it isn't
likely to help.

3) We can invade the offending countries, shoot anyone who resists, march
all those peasants, farmers and ranchers back out of the wilderness at
gunpoint, and set up puppet governments that will practice conservation.  I
hope we can all agree that this 'solution' is worse than the problem.

4) We can ask ourselves *why* these people are destroying their own land,
and look for ways to change these underlying factors.  This is potentially a
very productive approach, since it involves spreading knowledge, technology,
freedom and extropian ideas to some of the most impoverished people in the
world.  However, it requires a lot of hard work and a real understanding of
how politics, economics and social systems actually work.  It isn't
something you can do by holding conferences in exotic cities, preaching on
TV, or even starting a government program.

Right, but individuals (except for sociopaths) seek to maintain the
continuance of civilization. Collectively, we can refer to the effort to
sustain the prosperity of economic populations as "civilization" which is
the sense in which I think some writers mean it.

Yes, indeed. Of course after withdrawing a few trillion from our bank

We can virtually survive the virtual destruction of virtually every species,
right. But actuality remains virtually unimpressed.

I think young people need to worry about eco-destruction more than old folks

about this. Let the kids handle it.

That sounds very generous of you. Virtual morality has its own charm, I
suppose.


Some readers of _Consilience_ have commented:

Reading this book helped me put different kinds of knowledge together to
form a unified vision of life. As a member of humankind, we should not
imprison ourslves in a cave of practical skills and forget that well-rounded
knowledge is also good for our soul apart from its practical use. Another
book I am reading is as great for the same purpose. It uses adventure
stories in Virtual Reality to convey ideas about the nature of reality and
society, and convinces me that we humans together could be much more
creative and intelletually more powerful than we usually think. If you enjoy
reading this book, you might as well enjoy reading that one. Title: "Get
Real: A Philosophical Adventure in Virtual Reality."

The biologist Edward O. Wilson is a rare scientist: having over a long
career made signal contributions to population genetics, evolutionary
biology, entomology, and ethology, he has also steeped himself in
philosophy, the humanities, and the social sciences. The result of his
lifelong, wide-ranging investigations is Consilience (the word means "a
jumping together," in this case of the many branches of human knowledge), a
wonderfully broad study that encourages scholars to bridge the many gaps
that yawn [yeah, it can be slow reading in places. --J. R. ] between and
within the cultures of science and the arts. No such gaps should exist,
Wilson maintains, for the sciences, humanities, and arts have a common goal:
to give understanding a purpose, to lend to us all "a conviction, far deeper
than a mere working proposition, that the world is orderly and can be
explained by a small number of natural laws." In making his synthetic
argument, Wilson examines the ways (rightly and wrongly) in which science is
done, puzzles over the postmodernist debates now sweeping academia, and
proposes thought-provoking ideas about religion and human nature. He turns
to the great evolutionary biologists and the scholars of the Enlightenment
for case studies of science properly conducted, considers the life cycles of
ants and mountain lions, and presses, again and again, for rigor and vigor
to be brought to bear on our search for meaning. The time is right, he
suggests, for us to understand more fully that quest for knowledge, for
"Homo sapiens, the first truly free species, is about to decommission
natural selection, the force that made us.... Soon we must look deep within
ourselves and decide what we wish to become." Wilson's wisdom, eloquently
expressed in the pages of this grand and lively summing-up, will be of much
help in that search.

A brilliant, and insightful argument for the unity of all knowledge and the
need to search for consiliencethe proof that everything in our world is
organized in terms of a small number of basic laws of physics that comprise
the principles underlying every branch of learning. Wilson argues that there
is, intrinsically, only one class of explanation that unites the facts of
all disciplines by consiliencethe perception of a seamless web of cause and
effect. This book shines forth with groundbreaking concepts; it is 'big
bang' thinking at its best. It will appeal to all those who enjoy stretching
and challenging their mind, and are seeking to think on the cutting-edge,

It is rare that an accomplished scientist is able to muster the
philosophical acumen, the interdisciplinary prescience, and the literary
music to put together such a tour-de-force as this. On top of it all, he
retains enough of the piquancy of the modern idiom to make it click. This
book may take its place among Wealth of Nations, Democracy in America, and
other mind-changing dissertations as forks in the intellectual road of our
planet. C. P. Snow's Two Cultures advanced this hypothesis -- that science
and the humanities are diminished as long as they are insulated from each
other -- but the latter's sound and common-sense presentation was just a
lieder in the face of Wilson's symphony. "Literature" is what the critics of
the next century make it; I predict they will be raving about this one.

Readers, the point of the book is not consilience for its own sake, it's the
last chapter- "To What End". I have read quite a few of Wilson's other books
including On Human Nature, Sociobiology (all of it), Biophilia, Naturalist,
as well as others. I give him five stars because he says what I would like
to say if I had the wisdom, eloquence, and status, but this time he says it
better than ever. And it's not hard reading for those accostomed to large
intensive doses of scientific nonfiction. By bringing together the
scientific disciplines and humanities, the hope is that we might be able to
step outside of our "norms of reaction" in order to behave in ways for which
we are NOT programmed. To be able to realize not only why snakes and spiders
seem creepy to us, but also when and why we are treating our fellow man and
the planet like shit. That way maybe we can STOP. Don't forget the Professor
Wilson's lilypads in a pond: On the first day there is only one. Every day
the number doubles. On day 30 the pond is full. On which day was the pond
half empty ?

Wilson quite simply places into prose what we as reasonable beings should
have grasped all along, that there exists a reality that is independent of
human "sophistication". Are we so arrogant as to truly believe that we
create reality as we go along? I cannot accpet this. The problems of our
world will not be solved by the specialists, but by those individuals and
groups that understand that every particle in this universe is governed by
the same laws, from the basic laws of physics to the most intricate
biological systems. These laws do not and cannot conflict, only compliment.
Wilson just has the foresight to glimpse the future, for better or worse...

Wilson's prose is superior. Lacking the pseudo-intellectual arrogance found
among many academics today, he instead humbly conveys the case for the unity
of knowledge. Rather than claim he has found the complete answer, he
encourages the readers to delve into their own minds and experiences to find
further support for consilience. The credit given to the founders of modern
thought is a fitting introduction. Wilson's plea for humanity to become more
environmentally aware for our own sake is a timely conclusion.

Consilience is a work in progress, to be shaped and pushed forward by all
humankind. An excellent work for the dawn of the next millenium.

A book long overdue. Follows Bateson book on "unity". We need to see the
connectivity of all branches of nature and knowledge-there is so much wisdom
for humanity to gather from this process-to live in peace with our
environment and ourselves.

Consilience is a magnificent work, worthy of a Nobel Prize
Having finished Wilson's Consilience last night, I can honestly say that no
book has affected the way I think or the way I view society and science as
this one has. Wilson puts it all together for us. Consilience is the center
that defines the circle that is knowledge.

"Still, scientific theories are a product of imagination--informed
imagination. They reach beyond their grasp to predict the existence of
previously unsuspected phenomena. They generate hypotheses, disciplined
guesses about unexplored topics whose parameters the theories help to
define. The best theories generate the most fruitful hypotheses, which
translate cleanly into questions that can be answered by observation and
experiment. Theories and their progeny hypotheses compete for the available
data, which comprise the limiting resource in the ecology of scientific
knowledge. The survivors in this tumultous environment are the Darwinian
victors, welcomed into the canon, settling in our minds, guiding us to
further exploration of physical reality, more surprises. And yes, more
poetry."

If you have the vocabulary to easily grasp the author's message in that
paragraph, you will probably enjoy this book.

Consilience, the title word (not in the average dictionary), means,
according to one review, a "jumping together," but in my old 1913 dictionary
is defined as "the coming into agreement of generalizations from widely
differing inductions" and thus the author's theme is that it is time for the
various scientific disciplines to share with each other in those areas of
mutual interest. And he points out that many of the most momentous
disciplines have a great many areas of overlapping interest.

Edward O. Wilson was born in a good year, 1929, which is also the year of my
birth. He was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and received his B.S. and M.S.
from the University of Alabama, and in 1955, his Ph.D. in biology from
Harvard, where he has since taught.

He is the author of two Pulitzer prize-winning books, "On Human Nature,"
1978, and "The Ants," 1990. His specialty, throughout his career as a
scientist, has been ants, on ! which he is probably the world's foremost
expert.

But, as this book shows, he has not neglected other areas of human
knowledge. Indeed, he might well be classed as a "generalist," for his wide
range of interest and accumulated knowledge. Indeed, two chapters, "The
Mind," and "Ethics and Religion," held me enthralled, although I am still
trying to decide how to disagree with him.

He makes a seemingly air-tight case for the mind's being simply a result,
mechanical necessity, if you will, of the brain's electro-chemical
processes. All of which is carefully documented and researched, labeled and
identified.

My problem with that is the phenomenon of awareness: self-knowledge. I know
that I exist. If awareness is only a by-product of chemistry, electricity
and physics, then the creation is surely greater than its creator. The brick
overshadows the bricklayer.

I have similar problems with his thoughts on religion, specifically: God.

Wilson is a nominal Baptist, and calls himself a Deist, rather than a
Theist. An empiricist, rather than a transcendentalist. And, he admits that
he might be wrong.

But, the purpose of this review is not to argue with him. In the first
place, his formal educational credentials far exceed mine, and in the second
place, I would not wish to detract from his book. It is the kind of book
that you find once or twice in a decade: one that holds your interest with
reasoned argument, and in which the author is worthy of your complete
respect. His arguments are cogent, well-reasoned and careful, and the result
of a long lifetime of careful observation.

And that, alone, is refreshing in this age when every half-educated,
semi-literate ignoramus eagerly exercises his right to loudly proclaim an
opinion on any and every subject that crosses his mind, no matter how
transiently, in seemingly inverse proportion to the amount of data he has on
the subject.

Those who are blessed with a decent vocabulary and an inquiring mind will
enjoy this book,! whether you find yourself in total agreement with the
author, or not. Those described in the last paragraph would be better off to
save their money.

Most of the land being cleared by peasants in Brazil is to raise
cattle for export to american fast food chains. Gold fever has also
taken it's toll.

Kenya in 1976 had 1.1 million elephants, then under advisement from
animal right's advocates they banned sport hunting, and lost 1
million elephants to poaching (hunting has been restored). South
Africa and Botswanna both have always had legal hunting and have to
cull thousands of elephants every year. South Africa has not lost
an elephant to poachers since 1986.

Last time I looked Ducks Unlimited owned over 300,000 acres of
prime wetland habitat, PETA owned 0.

I agree with the problems of overpopulation.

Maybe Humanity's lack of a guiding philosophy has contributed to the fact that
more than 800 million people are malnourished, large segments of the population
continue to suffer from preventable diseases, and over 30 million people will
die each year from starvation or preventable diseases. Additionally, plant and
animal extinction, deforestation, soil erosion, ozone depletion, and other major
environmental problems are occurring. See
http://www.worldgame.org/wwwproject/what-b.html

Without a goal, happenstance determines a traveler's destination. Instead of
leaving its fate up to chance, Humanity should select its own destination for
its journey through time. Humanity as a whole should have a guiding philosophy.

I know nothing about the quality of the philosophy programs, so I'll restrict 
myself to the areas.

Davis is a small university city in farming country.  It's quieter, and 
cheaper, but it get cold in the winter and hot in the summer.

UCLA is smack in the middle of the hippest parts of LA.  It's expensive, 
crowded, and has lots of traffic, but there's a lot to do and it almost 
doesn't have weather.

FWIW, I interviewed at the biology department at UCLA in March.  They put on 
a great show, making UCLA look like it guaranteed a career and was a lot of 
fun for graduate students.  Several grad students told me "It's not just a 
show, it really is a lot of fun here.  That's why I've been hare seven years 
and I'm not done yet"  :-)

And just maybe individuals could solve all of these problems easily
if "humanity" (in the form of governments) would just get the fuck out
of the way and let the individuals do what needs to be done, and
probably make a nice profit while doing it.

If you look back over what I've written on this thread, you may notice the
fact that my comments address claims *you* have endorsed.  Since you have
yet to offer a substantive response to anything I've said, I must assume
that either you can't support them or you aren't interested in discussing
them.  Either way, it appears that there is no point in pursuing the topic.

So far as the book is concerned, your comments make it sound like yet
another "we have to sacrifice everything to save the planet or we'll all
die" tract, with a health dose of luddite technophobia thrown in for good
measure.  Of course I wouldn't waste time reading something like that - I've
got a 3-foot stack of productive reading I'm working through right now, and
that's as small as my to-read list is likely to get in the next decade.

The review you quote paints a very different picture.  While not one of the
ideas mentioned therein is actually new, the idea of combining them into a
coherent whole has enough promise to be worth looking into.  Anyone who
addresses that many topics in one book probably has something interesting to
say about something.

So, which picture is correct?  Is _Concilience_ a scholarly work devoted to
the time-honored goal of connecting all of human knowledge into a coherent
whole?  Or is it another environmental doomsday scenario?

Actually, it is the attempt to impose a unified vision on everyone that
generally causes such ills.

People are different, and thus will naturally have different goals,
philosophies, and outlooks on life.  You can attempt to persuade others to
accept your vision, but you can't reasonably expect to persuade *everyone* -
after all, other people are doing their own persuasion, and their goals will
often conflict with yours.

The only way to create a unified vision for an entire society is to resort
to force.  You must seize the reigns of power, outlaw and suppress rival
viewpoints, and require adherence to your chosen philosophy at gunpoint.
The result is predictable - no matter how noble the original ideas were,
your revolution will end up being run by the smartest, most unscrupulous
thugs in the country.  From there you take a quick road to whatever form of
authoritarianism they find most convenient.

IMO, we are much better off recognizing that no one has all the answers,
there is no "one, true way", and no one can be trusted to make all of our
decisions for us.  Freedom does not cure all ills, but it cures more of them
than anything else that has ever been tried.

Governments are not humanity, but just institutions created by individuals.

Yes, that's why I mentioned it in the first place.

What makes you think there's a difference?

So which is the problem - the fact that McDonald's will buy cheap beef, or
the fact that the Brazilians are willing to clear-cut their rain forest to
raise cattle?  I'd say the latter.

I know - one more example of how well socialist solutions work.  :-)

But it only matters for a tiny fraction of the ecology.  We've got lots of
30-60 year old timber, which is plenty old enough to form a habitat for
virtually the entire ecosystem.  It would be nice if we could also save that
last 1% that needs an authentic old-growth forest, but that isn't in the
same league as the major problems in other parts of the world.

Well, what exactly do you mean by "environmentally sound".  Pollution levels
are falling, conservation efforts are growing, and every reasonable effort
is being made to avoid causing damage (along with a lot of unreasonable
efforts).  I don't see that it would make sense to do more.  It makes more
sense to devote our limited financial resources to developing advanced
technology (which could free us from many of the tradeoffs we currently
face) than to spend even more money trying to preserve a tiny fraction of
the ecosphere that happens to be very vulnerable to perturbations.

Again, what exactly do you think we should be doing that we don't?  We are
already well past the point of diminishing returns where environmental
spending is concerned.

On the topic of saving the planet:

For all of you anarchist/libertarians/objectivists/etc. who feel that animal
and plant species are worth keeping around but decry the Green movement as
socialist and de-humanist, I offer you the following link:

http://www.esl.com.au/

Earth Sanctuaries Limited is an Australian corporation dedicated to
preserving the unique wildlife and ecosystems of Australia through the use
of pure, unadulterated capitalism (well, as much as they can get away with
in what is basically a socialist country). They sell shares of stock to fund
their efforts, and use the proceeds to buy land for sanctuaries. They also
make decent money through eco-tourism. The biggest hinderance they have is
that the Australian government is so concerned about protecting its unique
wildlife that it won't allow ESL to put monetary values on its animals or
sell them. For example, Japan has offered to purchase a platypus for one
million dollars, but ESL is not allowed to sell one. The platypus, BTW, is
not endangered.

They do excellent work and care very deeply both for the environment and
individual rights to property.

Those of us who profess to care about these things but haven't gotten
involved in groups like Greenpeace (for obvious reasons) should put our
money where our mouth is and support this free-market effort to preserve
highly endangered species (such as the Bilby, of which there are around 17
left, several of which were bred at ESL).

And if you don't care, I or no one else has the right to force you to. I
also don't think that the world will end or even care if bilbies disappear.
But I do.

Its funny, much of the remaining old growth in the US is actually in PRIVATE hands, because the government has allowed the logging of the old growth that it owns but is  not in National Parks. The logging companies get their hands on the private lands when the state increases the property tax assessment on the land (because its old growth its obviously worth more), and the owner cannot justify paying the greatly increased taxes, so they either sell it or log a greater percentage of it. Private forests are typically managed far better than public forest here.

The old growth here in NH was gone long ago. The old magnificent white pine was nearly exterminated by the agents of the British Royal Navy. There are less than a few dozen trees here that still have the King's Cross engraved in the tree. The other species were pretty much stripped by the 1880's. At the time, 90% of NH was cleared. Now less than 10% of NH is cleared. Thats a significant regrowth, and there are areas that are starting to reassert old growth characteristics, especially as wet as its been the last three years.

At least 75% of the forestland that was cut in the US in the last century has now grown back, which proves my original assertion: ecological catastrophes are temporary. The current earth-first nuts are just as spoiled and demanding of instantaneous results that they can't have as the brats of the consumer culture.

Yes, if we spend more money than is cost effective at this point in time on ecological recovery, the drag on the economy actually causes more pollution and ecological disruption than it prevents or mitigates.

I was excited over this news. I think the thylacine would be a great

A monocultural block of trees is not a forest, and to be fair under
your definition, South America should be free to destroy all but 1%
of the rainforest.

I agree things are better than they were, but we are a long way
from being in balance with our ecosystem. We agree that the answer
is more/better technology rather than less. The Bioneers are a good
example.

I'm saying that having had our way with our ecosystem and arguing
over doing in the last 1%, we're in no position to tell other
people what they should be doing.

Lead by example.

While no two humans are exactly the same, we are all of one race, the human
race, and we all share the experience of life in an essentially identical carbon
based life form structure. We all work for continuing survival while in this
structure, and hope for a happy, safe, and good life for ourselves and loved
ones. Therefore, everyone has a common desire for the best life attainable.
Since visions of the best life attainable are as numerous as the number of
people, the only universally acceptable definition would be, "the ability of
each person to live as they desire". Humans could voluntarily coordinate their
efforts to obtain that ability.


> IMO, we are much better off recognizing that no one has all the answers,

True. Therefore, humanity should devote some more resources toward finding the
answers.

With the right knowledge all illness can be cured. With the right knowledge
pollution can be eliminated. With the right knowledge all tangible and
intangible human needs and desires can be fulfilled. With the right knowledge,
any problem can be solved, and any desired result can be achieved. With the
right knowledge everyone can have a high quality of life, a heaven on earth, a
Utopia. Therefore, knowledge is the key to a better world. If humanity
recognized this reality, and devoted more resources toward knowledge, we could
accelerate the pace at which we reach a better world.

The three basic ways of interacting with knowledge, are: 1) dissemination from
accessing stored information, through teaching, or from other methods of
communication; 2) use through actions based on awareness of knowledge; and 3)
acquisition of new knowledge from research, through experience, or from other
avenues of discovery. Humanity has achieved proficient methods for dissemination
of information and simply needs to better utilize the same in order to
facilitate the use of knowledge. Yet, less than 2% of global productivity is
devoted toward finding new knowledge (research and development). Clearly
Humanity could and should be investing more in its future.

Cheers,

True, although it also introduces some extra noise in the
communication since they will try to hurt you by exaggerating bad
points or even making them up. Moderation is best, even when angering
people.

Myself, I try to avoid angering people because they lose their ability
to think flexibly when angry. In many ways making people angry is a
kind of coercion of their thinking (even if it is sometimes necessary
to prevent them coercing you). Of course, this could be just a
rationalization for me being a wussy conflict-aversive Swede :-)

The problem here is that "the best life attainable" is something
people disagree on, both due to different views on what it is and how
it can be achieved. There are people who are completely convinced that
the best way of achieve it is a socialist planned economy, and others
who think that the best life attainable is comitting suicide to reach
the higher energy state of the nice aliens. Between these extremes,
there are still significant differences, many of which are due to
values (do you value living close to nature over having technological
progress?) - which cannot be resolved and must be accepted. In
addition, these differences in value also make certain solutions
problematic: there are many people who think it is ethically
unacceptable with genetically modified organisms, even if they could
help improve crops and farming.

This is part of it. Knowledge gives us the base to act from, but we
need to be able to interface our various views well too. Knowledge can
help here too, but in the end I think we will find some irreducible
differences in value.

Definitely. But I wonder if we really have achived efficient methods
of disseminating information and teaching knowledge.

The Joys of a Classic Canadian Shore Lunch

by Mike Schoonveld 
- -----------------------------------------------------------------

No one knows who was the first to invent the meal or how it became
a Canadian tradition, but there is no finer feast available to
humans on this continent than the Canadian Shore Lunch. 
It may not be the most nutritious or healthy of meals, but there's
no denying it's delicious beyond description. 

Shore lunch is much more than just stopping along a lake and frying
up the morning's catch. Perhaps it started that way, but it has
developed into a ritual as much as a meal, and each part of the
ritual helps make up the shore lunch experience. 

The lunch site should always be on an exposed shoreline or on an
island in the lake. There should be trees nearby to assure plenty
of firewood, but the site itself should be on exposed granite of
the Canadian Shield. The spruce, aspen, birch, and other trees
along the lake shores of north-country lakes are more scenic than
functional as shade trees, and bugs and blackflies live in what
shade they produce. Regardless, summer days in the bush don't gain
their full heat until midafternoon anyway, so a lunch in the sun
always feels good. 

The cook fire is a snap to build. Several long-dead trees, four or
five inches in diameter, are gathered from the woods behind the
lunch site and arranged on the granite, some pointing one way, some
the other, with their butt ends overlapping. The fire is started
where the overlap occurs. As the fire burns the ends down it's a
simple matter to push the unburned portion of the logs farther into
the fire. 

Don't worry about gathering tinder, kindling, or finding the driest
firewood. A splash of gas from the outboard motor tank as a 
fire-starting aid is as much part of the shore lunch ritual as
cooking the pork and beans in the can. 

Besides the beans, the simple menu includes fried potatoes and
onions and batter-dipped fish filets, cooked in cast iron skillets.
What you drink is optional. Some choose a can of pop or beer,
others opt for a fire-boiled pot of coffee on chilly days. I
usually am happy with plain water, dipped straight from the lake
with a tin cup. There's nothing like being able to drink the water
from the lake you are fishing to prove you are in the wilderness. 

The fire isn't allowed to burn down to coals as we were taught in
Boy Scouts. This is a meal cooked by men following the tradition:
"When it's smoking it's cooking, when it's black it's done."
Actually, the type of trees burned in shore lunch cook fires don't
produce long-lasting coals like oak and hickory fires in the
Midwest do. 

Besides, no one likes waiting for fires to burn down to coals
before starting to cook. This is a lunch break, which though
enjoyable while it lasts, needs to end within a reasonable time
since there are more fish to be caught in the afternoon hours. 

The traditional shore lunch always features walleye. I've
substituted northern pike, smallmouth bass, perch, and lake trout
on occasion--and though good, they weren't the same. Walleye are
the best. 

While the campfire is started, the fish are filleted. Keeping with 
tradition, use a boat paddle for the fillet table and you'll be
doing shore lunch properly. 

Once the fish are cleaned, cast iron skillets are placed on the
fire (the burning logs balance the heavy loads nicely), and a brick
of lard is dropped into each fry pan to melt. (Lard is as
traditional as walleye. A northwoods vacation is about forgetting
the everyday cares of the world, and worries about cholesterol,
saturated or unsaturated fats, and the like are part of what I like
to forget while I'm there. Substitute vegetable shortening if you
must--but don't expect the results to be the same.) 

While the lard is melting, the potatoes and onions are sliced, and
once they are bubbling away in the hot grease, prepare the fish
batter. Each fishing guide has his own secret recipe--usually
containing bread or cracker crumbs, evaporated milk, salt, pepper,
and secret ingredients which may range from rye whiskey to cayenne
pepper. Cans of pork and beans are opened and set near the fire--be
sure to leave the lid attached to the can, it becomes the handle to
the tin-can cookpot. The potatoes and onions take a bit longer to
cook than the fish, but by the time the fillets are battered, the
spuds will have gotten a good head start. When the pieces of fish
start turning brown along their edges, it's time to turn them over
in the hot grease, and in another minute or two they'll be ready to
eat. 

Clean-up is a snap. Either burn the lard in the fire before dousing
it or simply dump it into a depression in the granite for bears to
clean up. The empty bean cans and other items are carried out and
the fire is extinguished with lake water. 

Once you've experienced a Canadian Shore Lunch, you understand how 
eating meals is more than just providing sustenance to your body,
and you appreciate more fully the call of the northland, the call
of the wilderness.

SETI@home is a commensal SETI sky survey at the National
Astronomy and Ionospheric Center's 305 meter radio telescope in
Arecibo, Puerto Rico. The sky survey covers a 2.5 MHz bandwidth
centered at 1420 MHz, as many researchers have suggested the 21 cm
Hydrogen line as the most likely band for intentional interstellar
transmissions to be lurking. The survey covers 28% of the sky
(declinations ranging from +1 to +35 degrees) with a sensitivity of
3E-25 W/m2. SETI@home observations will span a total of two years,
during which most of the sky will be observed two or three times.
Observations began in October 1998. 

Much of the SETI@home data analysis is accomplished using
distributed computing with the help of hundreds of thousands of
participants and their internet connected computers (Sullivan et al
1997).

Hello Jon,
I agree that knowledge is important.  Yet it seems there is another element
necessary; which is the ability to utilize knowledge rationally.  How many people
have the knowledge that smoking (or overeating, or not exercising, or drinking
excessively, or over-use of various other drugs) will decrease the quality and
length of their lives, yet continue to do so?  I think that for a large number of
problems causing human misery, knowledge of a cure already exists but is not put
into practice.  In many areas one can identify short-term incentives for people to
ignore knowledge that would help them in the long run, but in others I am
mystified.  In the health examples, it is very depressing to think that most people
do not possess whatever it is that would enable them to resist the momentary
pleasure of a cigarette (or whatever) in light of the knowledge they surely possess
of its longer-term consequences.

If more people were more willing to accept even unpleasant truths as reality, and
then behave as though those truths were really real, many of humanity's problems
would evaporate almost without trace.  Unfortunately, I see no signs of imminent
rampant rationality.

Regards,
- Steve

What should my computer be doing in its spare time?

Until an hour or so ago it was running the Great Internet Mersenne Prime
search. Currently it's running SETI@home.

My overburdened PC will take about two months to determine if
2^7196767-1 is prime. After that it will move on to another assigned
number.  The GIMPS program, running contiually as a low priority
background process, runs a number of iterations equal to the power being
tested. It seems to take an average of .6 seconds for each iteration,
but this time increases dramatically if it's running something heavy
like WebTrends. If it runs SETI@Home, the time per iteration goes up to
about 20 seconds. If it finds a million digit prime EFF will give me
$50,000. If it finds any new mersenne prime it will not only beep at me
but the team I'm with will throw a party in my honor.

The SETI@home software can be configured to run all the time, or as a
screensaver. It's resource intensive (using 15 megs RAM) and has a major
impact on my PC's performance. It appears to be running FFTs on 107.4
seconds of data recorded at Arecibo Radio Observatory early in January
of this year. It says it's 2.642% done after running 2 hours and 44
minutes. I'm not aware if there's any prizes for discovering signals
from an alien intelligence.

I have some doubts that an advanced alien civilization would be
communicating with radio, and think perhaps that if my PC finds anything
at all, it will be alien losers who missed out on their civilization's
singularity.

Comment are appreciated.

Thanks,
    -Mike

Enzyme Required To Prolong Life In Worms Identified By Researchers At 
Columbia; Key Enzyme Appears To Protect Animal Cells From Oxidative Damage
Researchers at Columbia University have discovered an enzyme that is 
required to prolong the life span of microscopic roundworms and that strains 
of long-lived worms appear to produce in greater quantity than normal.
They believe the enzyme, called cytosolic catalase, protects cells from 
oxidative damage, considered a key element in the aging process in all 
animals, including humans. Because oxidative damage has been implicated in 
Alzheimer's and Lou Gehrig's disease, the work may prompt medical 
researchers to ask new questions about such nervous system diseases.

"Our work demonstrates that oxidative damage is an important determinant of 
life span, and control of such damage might affect the life span of other 
organisms," said Martin Chalfie, professor of biological sciences at 
Columbia and leader of the team that produced the research, which is 
described in the May 13 issue of the British journal Nature.

The research was carried out in Caenorhabditis elegans, a soil worm about 
1/25 of an inch long that is a common experimental animal. The tiny worm has 
been useful to aging research because its normal three-week life span can be 
extended by environmental factors. In situations of overcrowding, food 
shortages or both, the emerging worm goes into a dormant period that can 
last as long as two months. If food is provided within that time, the animal 
emerges from dormancy and goes on to live its normal three weeks.

Scientists studying a possible genetic component to life span have been 
fascinated by this extended larval phase, called the dauer stage. "Dauer" 
means "lasting" in German. Several scientific teams have found mutations 
that send the worm into the dauer state at elevated temperatures. But even 
at normal temperatures and without going into the dauer stage, these mutant 
adults live two to four times longer than non-mutants. Yet these same 
mutants, if also bred to lack cytosolic catalase, died after three weeks, 
the Columbia researchers report.

"Scientists in the past have found mutations in C. elegans that affect the 
development of dauer larva and also prolong adult life," Professor Chalfie 
said. "However, until this paper it was not clear how that was accomplished. 
We believe we have found a key component."

That key component is cytosolic catalase, a protein that is also called 
CTL-1, which protects cells in the long-lived mutant worms from oxidative 
damage, thereby keeping them healthy. Mutant adult worms with long life 
spans exhibited elevated levels of the enzyme, as did non-mutants in the 
dauer stage, the Columbia team reports, but cells in normal adults do not.

"Our explanation for the long life spans in the mutant worms is that the 
catalase is protecting the cells from oxidative damage and keeping them 
healthy," Professor Chalfie said.

Oxidative damage occurs when oxygen-based compounds react with components of 
cells, modifying them and in some cases making them harmful to the cell. 
Such oxygen species -- peroxides, hydroxides and superoxides -- can be 
produced both in chemical reactions in the cell and from reactions between 
oxygen and ultraviolet light, a component of sunlight. Anti-oxidants such as 
vitamin E are thought to provide some protection against these molecules.

Some chemical reactions in cells produce hydrogen peroxide, but those 
reactions are confined to subcellular compartments, called peroxisomes, that 
contain catalases to rid the cell of this harmful product. Until the 
Columbia paper, animal cells were thought to have only peroxisomal catalase, 
though cytosolic catalase had been seen in both plants and yeast. The new 
catalase just identified, the first such enzyme found in animals, resides in 
the cell fluid, not within a specific compartment. In this more general 
location, the cytosolic catalase could act as a kind of surveillance system, 
removing harmful peroxides from throughout the cell. The research team 
dubbed the catalase CTL-1, and named the gene that produces it ctl-l.

Because the cells in adult roundworms do not divide, the research may be 
applicable to non-dividing cells in other animals, such as human nerve 
cells. Damage from oxidative stress has been implicated in nervous system 
diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
or Lou Gehrig's disease. Vitamin E is sometimes administered to combat 
Alzheimer's.

Past work on the dauer larvae suggested that a series of genes might control 
dauer formation and longevity. Professor Chalfie said there is as yet no 
evidence for any particular gene that controls life span either in worms or 
in humans, and that the Columbia research shows that cytosolic catalase 
simply protects cells from oxidative damage. In this view, the key to longer 
life spans would simply be to keep cells as healthy as possible by avoiding 
such hazards, rather than by activating some component of the genome.

"Our work suggests that the catalase pathway does not control adult 
longevity, but rather that when the pathway is disrupted, adults live 
longer," Professor Chalfie said. "In worms, genes do control the dauers to 
make them healthy, but there is no evidence so far that genes regulate life 
span in adults. The catalase genes are needed to make healthy, long-lived 
dauers, and in the mutants they are being inappropriately expressed to make 
adults live longer."

How could animals have acquired a gene that would have allowed them to live 
longer? An evolutionary argument can be made that acquiring a gene to extend 
adult life after reproduction would be difficult, if not impossible, 
Professor Chalfie said. However, a gene that would extend the dauer period, 
a dormancy period before reproductive maturity, might convey a selective 
advantage to the animal. Another explanation is that extended longevity in 
worms is a part of a more general mechanism that is a response to 
starvation, during which animals produce enzymes, such as cytosolic 
catalase, that protect cells.

The research team that made the discovery included James Taub, a graduate 
student, and Jonathan Rothblatt, a biologist, who had studied C. elegans 
catalases at Dartmouth but left to join the Chalfie laboratory. Columbia 
undergraduates Rafaz Hoque and Joe F. Lau contributed to the work, as did 
postdoctoral fellows Jang Hee Hahn and Charles Ma.

The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and by the 
American Cancer Society. Some strains of roundworm were received from the 
Caenorhabditis Genetics Center, which is funded by the NIH National Center 
for Research Resources.

World's First Cloned Pig to Be Born Within Months
Xinhua English Newswire

The world's first cloned pig should be born within months, British 
scientists predicted Thursday.

Researchers at Geron Bio-Med, a commercial spin-off of the Scotland-based 
Roslin Institute which produced Dolly the Sheep, told BBC they believed that 
cloned pigs will arrive by early 2000 at the latest.

Professor Ian Wilmutt, who helped develop the cloning technology known as 
nuclear transfer that produced Dolly, said he was hopeful of seeing cloned 
piglets "later this year or early in the new millennium".

The scientists hoped that eventually they could modify the technology to 
make other pig clones whose organs can be transplanted into humans.

Currently there are many more patients needing a transplant than there are 
donor organs available, and scientists believe pigs could fill this tissue 
gap.

Geron Bio-Med also believes its cloning technology is the key to producing 
animal tissue that is safe to use in humans, which the company hopes would 
help overcome the problems of rejection in organ transplant.

I agree that SETI may ultimately be seen as 'electromagnetic chauvinism',
and that if any signals we do find there, will be of aliens around our level
of development.  This would certainly narrow even further the odds of
detecting anything.  But even still, the discovery that there *are* other
intelligent civilizations out there, will be one of the greatest discoveries
of all time.  The complete relativity between our culture and theirs and the
mutual knowledge shared, could  be of immeasurable value.  I'd place my bets
and spare computer time on SETI@home, or you can have it continuing its
search for another prime number (yawn).

I think both projects are pretty useless.
I am running GIMPS out of curiosity and for a chance to 
win $50K from EFF (I'd rather it had financed my Newsfilter
project).  Explanations why GIMPS is useful on their own
page are quite pathetic.

It's strange that nobody has found more productive tasks
that could be distributed among multiple computers.

SETI does sound like it has at least some chance to find
something of interest.  I'd be willing to bet anything
against aliens though.   And I wouldn't want it to slow
down my computer.

Anybody has suggestions for distributed computations that
would actually be useful?

Do you know any practical tasks that require high computational
power and can be easily parallelized?

Well, actually, transmitting the hugest Mersenne prime into
space may serve as a demonstration of the computational power
of the civilization [that was wasted to find this number].

So maybe the intergalactic ether is filled with numbers
representing solutions to various problems - hard enough to
be impressive and useless enough not to reveal anything of
value.

Should we look for Mersenne primes coded in the cosmic 
radiowaves?

Distributed genetic algorithms to try to find good solutions to
problems? But the set of interesting problems with easily calculated
fitness functions may be small; most of the really interesting
problems (like AI or making good search agents) have rather diffuse
fitness.

Until Thursday, both my computers were doing GIMPS.  I decided
to split them between GIMPS and SETI.  I calculated that the probability
of GIMPS finding a new prime (with more than a million decimal digits)
is about 68% before the end of the year.  With my computers doing
about 118 P90 CPU hours per day, I figured my chances of winning
the $50,000 is about 1 in 4000 (altho the EFF prize was not the reason
I was doing GIMPS).

GIMPS does not slow down one's computer.  It stays out of your
way.  Ive been running it for about 10 months now, and it has never
caused problems.  My early impression of SETI is that it does not
get out of your way as well as GIMPS, if you have it set to run
continuously.  It makes some apps jerky.

The amount of CPU time currently wasted is truely mind boggling.
In deciding between the two, look beyond oneself and consider these
comparisons between SETI and GIMPS:

If you find the next megaprime, you, personally, will go down in
the mathematical history books (and be 50k richer), but the significance
to humankind is negligible.  With SETI, the consequences of finding a
ET signal are incalculable.  We know the next megaprime is out there,
and it is close at hand.  With SETI we have no such reassurance.

On the other hand, the nondiscovery of ETI is perhaps just as
profound, for we get a new sense of how rare is intelligence.
Furthermore, every time we gaze into the starry night sky,
we can tell ourselves with a sweeping arm gesture:
aaaalllll of thaaaat... is ours.  Lets go get it!  All of it!  spike

Title
  Alterations in mood after changing to a
  low-fat diet.
Source
  British Journal of Nutrition.  79(1):23-30, 1998 Jan.
Abstract
  The effects on mood of reducing dietary fat
  while keeping the energy constant were examined in ten male and ten female
  healthy volunteers aged between 20 and 37 years. Each volunteer consumed a
  diet containing 41% energy as fat for 1
  month. For the second month half of the subjects changed to a
  low-fat diet (25% energy
  from fat) and the remainder continued to eat the
  diet containing 41% energy from fat.
  Changes in mood and blood lipid concentrations were assessed before, during
  and at the end of the study. Profile of mood states (POMS) ratings of
  anger-hostility significantly increased in the intervention group after 1
  month on the low-fat diet,
  while during the same period there was a slight decline in anger-hostility in
  the control subjects (group F 6.72; df 1.14; P = 0.021). Tension-anxiety
  ratings declined in the control group consuming the higher
  fat diet but did not change in the group
  consuming the low-fat diet
  (group F 6.34; df 1.14; P = 0.025). There was a decline in fasting
  concentrations of HDL-cholesterol after the
  low-fat diet and a small
  increase in subjects consuming the medium-fat
  diet (group F 4.96; df 1.12; P = 0.046), but no significant
  changes in concentrations of total serum cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol or
  triacylglycerol were observed. The results suggest that a change in
  dietary fat content from 41 to 25% energy
  may have adverse effects on mood. The alterations in mood appear to be
  unrelated to changes in fasting plasma cholesterol concentrations.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a
  very-low-fat
  diet with a low-fat
  diet supplemented with monounsaturated oil on plasma lipid
  levels in subjects with hypercholesterolemia. DESIGN: The 8-week study was
  divided into one 2-week baseline diet and two 3-week
  intervention periods in a randomized crossover design. SETTING: The study was
  conducted in an outpatient setting at the Deakin Institute of Human
  Nutrition, Deakin University, Geelong, Australia. SUBJECTS: Twenty-four
  free-living subjects with hypercholesterolemia participated in and completed
  the study. INTERVENTION: After a 2-week baseline period of a self-selected
  diet, subjects were assigned to one of two
  dietary interventions: a
  very-low-fat (10% of
  energy from fat), high-carbohydrate diet or
  a low-fat (26% of energy from
  fat) diet supplemented with olive oil and
  an olive oil-based margarine. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lipid measurements
  included total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein
  cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride
  concentrations. Plasma cholesteryl esters were measured to monitor
  compliance. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: A paired t test was used to assess
  differences between treatment periods for each subject. The dependence of the
  difference between treatment periods on the covariates of age, sex, initial
  cholesterol concentration, and energy intake was analyzed using repeated
  measures and analysis of covariance. RESULTS: The
  low-fat diet supplemented
  with monounsaturated fat resulted in significantly less
  high-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering than the
  very-low-fat
  diet (P=.005). Both interventions resulted in significant
  reductions in both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and
  total cholesterol compared with the baseline diet.
  APPLICATIONS: This study suggests that a
  low-fat diet enriched with
  olive oil provides advantages over a
  very-low-fat
  diet in the control of serum lipoproteins among persons with
  hypercholesterolemia.

I can relate to your 'dilemma'. I'm 25, currently in junior college, 2 yrs out of the military. I have about 500 ideas scrawled out on notebook paper, thrown haphazardly in a worn folder, but still organized. Some of my ideas I'm pretty sure no one else has thought of. I've 'invented' products, mechanisms, and various devices which can all make life easier. I try look at things in twisted ways to see how they might function. Right now, I'm surfing all the UFO and ET sights, not that I care about the reported anomalies, just to learn the ins and outs of magnetic levitation, antigravity, blast electricity, etc. If my ideas have any relevance I of course would like to get paid so I can do more research. I'm not comfortable at all submitting any of my ideas to some fly by night company for a small fee, or going through the red-tape beauracracies. Any advice is greatfully accepted.

Well, the low-fat diet at the same time has many advantages,
for mental and physical performance, general health, and
longevity.  And the negative mood effects can probably be
easily removed with some mild mood elevators like 5-HTP
and St. John's Wort, or walks in the park, or music, or
whatever.

The first month on a high-fat diet one may spend in a better
mood, but eventually it may bring one to an unsightly state
where his mood can't be easily improved...

It seems strange that somebody would conduct a long and costly
experiment finding out results of a simple-minded strategy.

Why not research what can actually work, and give that advice
to people?  "If you have any problems with mood on a low fat-diet,
try to turn up the lights, listen to good music, and have more sex."

This article gave people a choice between being fat/unhealthy and being
depressed.

The reason why these projects are popular is because of the curiosity
factor, and because they are both goals which have no direct profit
motive. If you want to get thousands or millions of people doing
parallel processing for something, the motivator is the idea of finding
"real live aliens", or the X-factor. If you were actually making a
profit off of the work their computers were doing they'd obviously want
to get paid for it...

I beg to differ.

Some months ago I made a post concerning the Atkins diet...(hi protein...low 
carbohydrate)...it was met with considerable derision.

Consequently I did a little research.  

There is another doctor who has done similar investigations.  He has also 
written a book.  It's entitled "Protein Power" by Drs. Eades (husband and 
wife)...

Url = http://www.eatprotein.com/

There is atkins as mentioned..

There is another dr. whose book I haven't read yet...his title is called "The 
Zone"...

What I've gleaned from all of this is summarized in the Eades book. 

 Briefly he says that for ten thousand generations man was a meat eater who 
supplimented his diet with ocassional veggies...(Hunter Gatherer)...then the 
agricultural revolution occured and our nutritional problems began.

He supports this by talking extensively about the egyptians.(also a great 
number of footnotes and a bibliography)  It seems significant information can 
be gathered by examining egyptian mummies of which there a suprisingly large 
number.  Supposedly the egyptians had many of the same problems we 
do....(heart disease...obesity...etc etc).....which their predescessors (the 
hunter gathers.......) did not..

I suggest that anyone interested read Dr. Eades book.

Oh..by the way...it works.

I'm down to 225 from 280...in several months... And when I eat carbohydrates 
(except for beer...which is where I get almost all of the carbs I eat...and 
then I go to sleep)...I feel bad..

My normal diet is eggs...steak...milk....cheese...all the bad things.(and 
beer of course..but I try to be moderate)


My brother is on a similar diet...with similar results.  He has more money 
than I have as well as access to medical services I don't.  He's had his 
blood composition monitored.  Such things as triglycerides...cholesterol 
levels...and things I've no clue as to what they are...have all improved  
considerably.

Of course...youre milage may vary..

I agree. However, seti@home at least provides a detailed map of the
radio skies. I'd rather wish they'd look for peculiarly white RF
sources but I guess technical difficulties detecting them are 
prohibitive. The signal strength will be very low, and the signals 
are probably highly directed.

Well, due to the nature of the links the task must require essentially 
zero communication. Distributing slices of search space where results
take a great long while to compute and collecting the compact results
is a pretty strong constraint.

It doesn't, since it's very nice -- at least the Linux version is. 
It takes 10 MBytes RAM to run though.

Yes. Huge distributed GAs to find the best mutation function for
mutating machine code and FPGA cells and mapping rules of 3d CA 
spaces. All computationally expensive yet requiring little bandwidth.

Maybe, if $50K was promised to be shared between the person
who finds the number and a person who let him know about the
project, there would be a lot more people in it.
This referral scheme may sound non-kosher for a public project,
but it's still the same money that is targeted for the same
purpose, right?  Except that it will work better...

Why not utilizing open-ended evolution? It would be rather difficult
to code, though.

Cyborg Seeks Community

Meet one of the creators of wearable computing and join him in his search 
for like-minded folks to live in an augmented reality.

By Steve Mann

People find me peculiar. They think its odd that I spend most of my waking 
hours wearing eight or nine Internet-connected computers sewn into my 
clothing and that I wear opaque wrap-around glasses day and night, inside 
and outdoors. They find it odd that to sustain wireless communications 
during my travels, I will climb to the hotel roof to rig my room with an 
antenna and Internet connection. They wonder why I sometimes seem detached 
and lost, but at other times I exhibit vast knowledge of their specialty. A 
physicist once said he felt that I had the intelligence of a dozen experts 
in his discipline; a few minutes later, someone else said they thought I was 
mentally handicapped.

Despite the peculiar glances I draw, I wouldnt live any other way. I have 
melded technology with my person and achieved a higher state of awareness 
than would otherwise be possible. I see the world as images imprinted onto 
my retina by rays of light controlled by several computers, which in turn 
are controlled by cameras concealed inside my glasses.

Every morning I decide how I will see the world that day. Sometimes I give 
myself eyes in the back of my head. Other days I add a sixth sense, such as 
the ability to feel objects at a distance. If Im going to ride my bicycle, 
Ill want to feel the cars and trucks pressing against my back, even when 
they are a few hundred feet away.

Things appear different to me than they do to other people. I see some items 
as hyperobjects that I can click on and bring to life. I can choose 
stroboscopic vision to freeze the motion of rotating automobile tires and 
see how many bolts are on the wheels of a car going over 60 miles per hour, 
as if it were motionless. I can block out the view of particular 
objectssparing me the distraction, for example, of the vast sea of 
advertising around me.

I live in a videographic world, as if my entire life were a television show. 
And many people assume that by living my life through the screen, I do 
exactly what television leads us to dotune out reality. In fact, WearComp 
has quite the opposite effect: Visual filters help me concentrate on what is 
important, heightening my sensitivity and setting my imagination free. I do 
of course have occasion to remove my computational prostheses, as when I 
sleep, shower or splash around in the ocean.

In addition to having the Internet and massive databases and video at my 
beck and call most of the time, I am also connected to others. While I am 
grocery shopping, my wifewho may be at home or in her officesees exactly 
what I see and helps me pick out vegetables. She can imprint images onto my 
retina while she is seeing what I see. I hope to add to the population of 
similarly equipped people; last fall at the University of Toronto, I taught 
what I believe to be the worlds first course for cyborgs (see sidebar 
School for Cyborgs).

Much of my passion has been fueled by a desire to restore some balance of 
privacy in a world where individuals are increasingly affronted by 
government surveillance and corporate encroachments. In fact, one goal of my 
work was to challenge the notion of totalitarian video surveillancethe 
now-common practice of a corporate or governmental establishment wishing to 
know everything about everyone in the establishment while revealing nothing 
about itself. Many department stores, for example, use large numbers of 
hidden cameras and yet prohibit customers from taking pictures.

I attempted to draw attention to this phenomenon of unreciprocated video 
surveillance in Shooting Back, a documentary I made during my day-to-day 
life in several different countries over a period of many years. Whenever I 
found myself in a store or some other establishment with electronic eyes 
perusing the premises, I asked its management why they were taking pictures 
of me without my permission. They would typically ask me why I was so 
paranoid and tell me that only criminals are afraid of cameras. Of course I 
was covertly recording this response using my own hidden eyetap video 
camera. Then I would pull an ordinary camcorder out of my satchel and give 
them a chance to explain their position for the record. (The camcorder was 
simply a prop, of course, as the eyetap camera had been capturing the 
scene.) The same people who claimed that only criminals were afraid of 
cameras had an instantly paranoid (and sometimes violent) reaction to my 
camcorder. Shooting Back was, I believe, the first documentary to be 
transmitted in real time to the World Wide Web while it was shot. (Selected 
portions of Shooting Back may be viewed at 
http://wearcam.org/shootingback.html.)

Ahead of My Time

Growing up during the 1960s and early 1970s, I always seemed to be creating 
things before their time. I grew up in Hamilton, Ontarioa city on the 
western tip of Lake Ontario about 100 kilometers from Toronto. I came by 
this inclination naturally; during the early 1950s, my father had built what 
was perhaps the first wearable radio. (He had pursued radio as a hobby since 
his childhood.) He had taught me quite a bit about electronic circuits by 
the time I started kindergarten. As a young child, I removed the head from a 
portable battery-powered dictating machine and replaced it with the head 
from a high-fidelity audio cassette deck. From this cassette transport 
mechanism, I built a system that enabled me to listen to music while walking 
around. While many people scoffed at this invention, I found it nice to be 
able to drown out background music while shopping, to assert my own idea of 
personal space, and to defend myself from theft of my solitude by the 
department stores with their Muzak.

In my teens I founded a concept of mediated reality, which I called 
lightspace. The goal of lightspace was to experience an altered perception 
of visual reality by exploring a large range of possible forms of 
illumination while observing a scene or object from different viewpoints. My 
work with lightspace led to the invention of my wearable computer. My desire 
to create photographic instruments that would function as true extensions of 
my mind and bodyand my desire to control these photographic instruments in 
new wayscreated a need for the ability to program complex sequences of 
events.

I began to take this matter seriously, building a digital computer from a 
large number of electronic components salvaged from an old telephone 
switching computer. I did much of this experimentation in the basement of a 
television repair shop where I spent much of my childhood as a volunteer, 
fixing TV sets. In this shop I built up a great deal of knowledge about 
electronic circuits.

The result of my early efforts was, in the early 1970s, a family of wearable 
computers I called WearComp0. Sometimes I took these cumbersome prototypes 
outside in search of spaces dark enough to explore the altered perception of 
visual reality I could create using portable battery-powered light sources. 
People would cross the street to avoid me, not knowing what to make of what 
must have looked to them like an alien creature. The rig was physically a 
burden, weighing as much or more than I did. After wearing one of these 
encumbrances from sundown (when it got dark enough to use them) to sunrise, 
my feet would be swollen, blistered and bleeding.

I continued to refine WearComp0 and its evolutionary successor, WearComp1. 
After much tinkering, I came up with WearComp2my first system that truly 
qualified as a wearable computer in the sense that it was not just a special 
purpose device. WearComp2 was field programmable, with a full-function input 
device (a keyboard and joystick for cursor control both built into the 
handle of an electronic flashgun), text and graphical displays, sound 
recording and playback (crude, home-brew analog-to-digital and 
digital-to-analog converters), and a wireless data connection to provide 
links to other computers. I completed this system in 1981, before most of 
the world realized that computers could be portable, much less wearable.

Though an advance over my earlier prototype, WearComp2 was still a burden to 
lug. I wanted to reduce its bulk and make it look more normal. This goal led 
me in 1982 to experiment with building components directly into clothing. I 
learned how to make flexible circuits that could be embedded into ordinary 
fabric. This work enabled me to make versions of WearComp that were not only 
more comfortable to walk around in but also less off-putting to others.

In spite of these advances, my life as a cyborg remained mostly solitary. I 
did connect quite literally (by serial data cable) with an understanding 
woman during my freshman year at McMaster University in my hometown of 
Hamilton. We faced unusual challenges in this configuration, such as having 
to choose which public restroom to use when we were joined. Thinking back, I 
imagine we must have made a comical sight, trying to negotiate doorways 
without snagging the cable that tethered us together.

Such relationships were rare, and it was seldom that I could get others to 
wear my seemingly strange contraptions. Many people were unable to get past 
my technological shell, which they apparently found more than a little odd. 
Still, multimediated reality had provided me with a unique vision of the 
world, and by the mid-1980s I had a following of people on the fringes of 
society who shared (or at least appreciated) my vision. I was invited to 
shoot pictures for album covers and hair ads. By 1985, I began to realize 
that it wasnt just the finished photographs people wanted; they also seemed 
to enjoy watching me take the pictures. Often I would be shooting in large 
warehouses, with audiences of hundreds of people. I began to realize that I 
had become a cyborg performance artist. By the end of the 1980s, however, I 
found myself yearning to return to my more substantive childhood passions 
for science, mathematics and electrical engineering.

While at McMaster, I added biosensors to the WearComp so that it could 
monitor my heart rate (as well as the full EKG waveform) and other 
physiological signals. I also invented the vibravesta garment studded 
with radar transceivers and vibrating elements. Wearing this vest made 
objects at a distance feel as if they were pressing against my body. I could 
close my eyes and walk down the hallway, confident that any wall or other 
obstacle would be felt as warning vibrations on the appropriate side of the 
vest. By sparing myself from the cognitive load of processing all that 
visual information, I found I was able to think more clearly.

In 1991, I brought my inventions to MIT as a PhD student. As a cyborg, 
uprooting myself from Canada was a formidable task, since I had installed my 
cyberbody in Canada over a period of many years. Going to MIT was a sudden 
move of my extended self.

First, I secretly climbed up onto the rooftops of buildings around the city 
to put in place the wireless data communications infrastructure I had 
brought with me from Canada. I had to quickly deploy my base stations at the 
top of elevator shafts or anywhere else I could find warm dry places. This 
way, whenever I wanted an Internet connection, these gateways would be ready 
to send the data to me, no matter where I waseven if I was in a basement or 
riding on the subway.

Although I kept in touch with my family through cyberspace, my first two 
years at MIT were lonely times IRLin real life. I was, after all, the only 
person there with a wearable computer. Then in 1993, at the request of a 
fellow student, a local engineer named Doug Platt built a wearable system. I 
was no longer the only cyborg at MIT.

It took some years to get other cyborgs at MIT, thus enabling the beginnings 
of a sense of community. Although I never succeeded in getting a large 
community outfitted with my high-speed packet radio systems, the cellular 
telephones that began to emerge provided another answer to the problem of 
connectivity.

By the end of 1995, my work was attracting serious academic interest. I was 
asked to write an article about my work for IEEE Computer, a publication of 
the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Computer Society. I 
also proposed an academic symposium on wearables and was referred to T. 
Michael Elliott, executive director of the Computer Society. I figured that 
such a conference would legitimize the field, which until then had consisted 
in many peoples minds of Steve, that crazy guy running around with a 
camera on his head. Elliott was enthusiastic about the idea and in 1996 the 
Computer Society responded with an overwhelming yes. This marked a turning 
point in my acceptance by my professional peers.

More than 700 people attended this first IEEE-sponsored symposium on 
wearable computing, held in Cambridge, Mass., in October 1997. A gala 
Wearables event the following day drew 3,000 people. In that same year I 
received my doctorate from MIT in wearable computing. This was a gratifying 
culmination: I had turned a childhood hobby and passion into an MIT project, 
the topic of a conference, and a PhD dissertation.

This past year I returned to Canada to pursue my work at the University of 
Toronto. Why Toronto? I had lived there in the mid-1980s, and the city had 
seemed very cyborg-friendly. I had sensed there a cosmopolitan diversity 
as well as a genuine warmth and openness that contrasted with the more 
cyborg-hostile and tense atmosphere of some large U.S. cities.

Wearing Well

Although I spent many years developing WearComp in relative isolation, I 
welcome efforts to commercialize wearable computers. At the vanguard is 
Xybernaut, based in Fairfax, Va. Xybernauts latest model is being 
manufactured by Sony, indicating that the Japanese electronics giant has an 
interest in what some believe will become the Walkman of computing. Last 
May, Xybernaut organized its own conference on wearable computing (and 
invited me to give the keynote address). I may also begin to license some 
embodiments of my original WearComp, as well as many of my more recent 
innovations, to companies who want to manufacture commercial systems. I 
think it will be especially important to make the cyborg outfit less 
cumbersomesomething thats long been a goal of mine. My latest version is 
quite sleek, and looks just like ordinary bifocal eyeglasses, with the 
eyetap point hidden along the cut line. Even when fully rigged, I can still 
play an acceptable game of squash.

I realize that some people see me and my invention as a potential 
threatlike the Borg of Star Trek fame: You will be assimilated. Clearly, 
there are important philosophical issues to be explored. Not only is there 
the danger of the technology being used to monitor people to make them into 
obedient productive cyborgs, but there is also the potential that people 
will become too dependent on this technology. My goal as a responsible 
inventor and engineer, however, has always been to encourage the development 
and manufacture of wearable computers as a means of personal, not 
institutional, empowerment. That will make worthwhile all the obstacles and 
challenges I have faced during my more than 20 years of developing this 
technology.

I hope that if I bring WearComp to market, anyone who wishes to will 
eventually be able to become a cyborg. Well live in a collaborative 
computer-mediated reality that will allow us to no longer need to 
distinguish between cyberspace and the real world. And then this cyborg will 
have lots of company.

I think that this would definitely be a cosmic filter. Civilizations
with insufficient computational power would never detect such
transmissions. They would seem to just be random data. Perhaps there is
a whole type of ascii which is nothing but prime based, and we are
totally ignoring it!

My own opinion is that such civlizations transmit in the oxygen
absorption wavelengths, to filter out non-spacefaring civilizations, so
the Aricebo data IMHO could be worthless.

I always thought that it's much more productive to
spend more time trying to figure out what it is that
SETI is looking for than scanning known frequencies
for not-well-thought-through patterns.

We already probably would send out signals that SETI
wouldn't be able to detect.  How can they detect signals
coming from entities whose mental architectures,
computational powers, and command over physical world
are dramatically different and superior to ours?

Why not create a good web of ideas about aliens instead?
Would cost a lot less money.  
Except that people are much more comfortable searching
for things they know.   Alas, ETI is not among them.

[Should we suggest a few ideas to GIMPS + SETI?]

It's statements like this that make me regard hi-protein diet advocates
with such derision.  (the authors, not you)

Hunter-gathers do not normally eat mostly meat diets.  Hunter-gatherer groups
from tropical and warm temperate regions (our only habitats up to the Upper
Paleolithic Revolution) eat predominantly vegetable diets with meat rarely
comprising more than 30% of the diet.  
(source: The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Human Evolution)
Although hi-meat diets of groups like eskimos and pastoralists demonstrate
humans can tolerate hi-meat diets, it certainly isn't our evolutionary
heritage.

The dieats hunter-gathers actually eat rather resemble the AHA 
recommendations - moderate fat, moderate meats, plenty of fruits and
vegetables, much fat polyunsatured.

Incidentally, a prior "meat diet" fad in the thirties bit the dust when the
practicioners started showing up with high rates of heart disease.  I can't
claim to have actually hunted down the refs for this as the UC Irvine
library basically only goes back to the fifties.

Low carb diets was the standard for diabetes for many years.  That shifted
more recently - in the 60's, I think, when it was shown that the low
carb diet exacerbated diabetic heart disease problems.  The recommended
diet for diabetes now is high complex carbohydrates with careful
control of timing and portions.

I have my own layman's opinions and hopes about these, and think that cancer 
will, indeed, prove more tractable than many now expect -- I'm still very 
hopeful that the research spurred by last year's publication of mouse 
research with angiostatin and endostatin has generally opened up a whole new 
avenue focusing on neovascularization.  This will, hopefully, prove to be a 
stop-gap, pending more fundamental understanding and manipulation of 
fundamental genetics.

Everything in moderation!

    If you take an objective look at many of the papers on diet (especially
for diabetics) it is clear that the large, well controlled studies show that
a balanced diet is usually the most effective one in lowering body fat
percentages and increasing wellness overall.  Unfortunately, we in western
countries sometimes have a skewed view of what a "balanced diet" actually
is.
    High levels of carbs are DEADLY!  The high carb diets previously
advocated by the ADA and the AHA have been shown to exacerbate most of the
problems experienced by most type II diabetics.  On the other hand, high
protein diets are not particularly healthy either.  High levels of protein
can cause ketosis (the Atkin's Diet actually seeks to cause this condition),
a condition which in addition to causing some biochemical changes which
aren't too healthy puts fat cells in a mode where they are more likely to
store fat.
    So, the consensus seems to be that high anything is not good for you.
Some of the current books on low carbs/ high protein are actually just a
balanced diet, it only appears different because the western diet is far too
high in fat and carb calories.  These books have not stated anything
revolutionary from a biochemical standpoint, it is just that the medical
community has had their head in the sand for about twenty years and these
people are just stating the obvious. (With the exception of Dr. Walford who
has been saying the same things for quite a while)
    I have not read Eades book so I can't comment on his strategies but I
have read some of Dr. Barry Sears' "Zone" series (It is NOT a high protein
diet by any means) and he is about as close to reflecting a good, practical
diet for weight loss and anti-aging as I have seen.  Unless of course if you
want to go in for caloric restriction, which is more effective, but terribly
spartan for my taste.  If you have the discipline, then Dr. Walford's
program is for you.  It also is a balanced diet, it just has much fewer
calories overall.
    Some links for you:
         Dr. Barry Sears site: www.enterthezone.com
         Dr. Roy Walford's site: www.walford.com
    I am assembling a bibliography on this topic right now.  It should be
available via the web in a couple of weeks.  I'll post when it goes up.

   Headline from the front page of the Saturday May 15,1999 issue of the
 Globe and Mail newspaper:

 "Reviving an Extinct Species

   Austrian Museum director Michael Archer examines an 1866 embryo of a
 Tasmanian Tiger, an extinct species that scientists hope to revive.
 Because the embryo was preserved in alcohol, its DNA remained intact.
 Scientists now hope to clone this embryo and others, thus bringing the
 species back to life."

   The article continues on page 2, and states that geneticists are now
 saying that this proposed species revival is not a joke, and that it
 could be done. The relevance to cryonicists is that any attempt to
 provide a lower cost alternative to current liquid nitrogen suspension
 will have to involve dehydration. None of the methods of chemical
 preservation (formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, etc) which involve storage in
 an aqueous medium truly prevent deterioration of tissue. Only methods
 which involve dehydration (alcohol storage, anhydrobiosis, etc) can have
 any hope of offering a viable alternative to low temperature storage.
   The following is a quote regarding glycerol treated bone marrow stored
 at dry ice temperatures from (Cryobiology 65-69 1970):

  "Smears of all human bone marrow samples stored for 3 to 9 years at Dry
 Ice temperatures revealed disruption of normal cellular architecture of
 the bone marrow cells. Virtually all cells showed nuclear vacuolation,
 pyknosis, and karyolysis. The only cells with intact architecture were
 lymphocytes and cells of erythroid series. Many of these contained
 nuclear vacuoles. In addition the smears contained numerous remnants of
 cells which could not be recognized as to type. Differential counts
 revealed that on the average only 5 to 10% of cells maintained distinct
 nuclear outlines. These cells were predominantly of lymphoid and
 erythroid series with occasional eosinophils and monocytes.
  Similar changes were observed in samples of human and dog bone marrow
 stored in liquid nitrogen for 1, 2, and 3 years. However, these changes
 were found only in about 5 to 10% of cells regardless of the time of
 storage. In an occasional smear, the proportion of damaged cells reached
 as high as 20%. The changes in liquid nitrogen-stored bone marrow were
 not confined to any specific cell types.
  ....
   The observations reported in this paper indicate that very severe
 changes have taken place in bone marrow stored for over 3 years in Dry
 Ice. It has been previously shown that bone marrow cells stored under
 identical conditions for periods of up to 1 year maintain their normal
 morphology.
   However changes became apparent by 2 years and were severe by 3."

That's kinda what I decided..

If you check the labels on our food...they contain a tremendous amout of 
carbs.  Trying to limit them is difficult.  Assuming that our metabolism 
wasn't evolved to deal with such a large amount then you can see how it can 
skew things..

I've been checking Nanovation's web site periodically for a while now.  They 
say they will have an IPO this summer.  I'd be very curious to hear 
assessments of their technology from folks who are more technically competent 
than me.

BTW, note that Microvision (www.mvis.com) (MVIS on NASDAQ) took a 25% jump 
last week that stuck on heavy trading (retaive to previous average trading 
days).  There's still plenty of run in that hoss, IMHO, so it's not too late 
to get in on one of the key early wearable technologies.

I'd appreciate extropic comments from anyone interested in enhancing our
senses, and what how this will affect our primal instincts, and, thus,
advance our insight and intra/interpersonal communications, for example.

	What types of brain enhancements might be designed to deal with the
relaying of new information gained from enhancing the senses (especially
smell and hearing).  How will the brain's cognitive capabilities sift
through the enhanced information and utilize expanded sensorial capabilities? 

	What types of intelligent agents will assist us in using enhanced
sensorial information to discern our environments more intelligently, and
how will this affect our communication skills?  Is it important to upgrade
the job of the early primitive brain so that it works nicely in conjunction
with enhanced senses to give it more spin, and what might be deployed to
develop and expanded insight and "gut" feelings from the input from
enhanced senses to better understanding of feelings, exploring empathy,
insight, to help us make better decisions with more information?

	Is 'gut feeling' important in the advancement of ourselves?
(Instinct/Intuition)

It seems to me that all CAs (cellular automata) are inherently
incompatible with the spirit of Special Relativity, at least in the
current formalism.  CAs have what we might call a One True Space of
Simultaneity, the prohibition of which was the entire point of having
Special Relativity in the first place.  The whole problem with CAs, that
the speed of light will appear different to different observers, derives
from the fact that there are absolute positions (the cells) and thus
absolute velocities.  Maybe you could alter the formalism so that the
cells didn't have absolute positions, but you'd still have the problem
that the number of cells between cell A and cell B, and thus the time
for light to go between them at one tick per cell, is absolute; and thus
the speed of light (relative to your own speed) is NOT.  In Special
Relativity, a fast-moving observer would have to see fewer cells and
slower ticks.

Maybe you could alter the formalism to fix that.  Frankly, I don't think
so.  CAs separate space and time into neat little independent Newtonian
coordinates.  I don't see how you can have one objectively correct
universal separation into discrete cells and not have neat little
Newtonian coordinates.  In Special Relativity spacetime is continuous,
and the transformation of some axis from space into time is also continuous.

One might say that Special Relativity says that "real" things occupy a
continuum between rules and data, while in Turing machines things are
separated into rules and data.  Another of the many reasons to
best-guess that the physical Universe is noncomputable.  And also a
rationale for Power-class technologies like Greg Bear's "descriptor
theory", or being able to change the laws of physics:  I think we'll
find that there's no rigid distinction between substance, law, and
metalaw, and that all three can be changed.  Well, now I'm getting
Eganic, so I better sign off.

That's a good point.  There are a couple of ways out, though.  The first
is to say that there *is* an absolute frame of space and time, but
that Lorentz transformations govern the relationships between moving
coordinate frames.  If you do this then it follows that the speed of
light is the same in all frames and that the absolute frame can't be
distinguished from other frames.  Technically they didn't need to reject
the luminiferous ether to accommodate the Michelson Morley experiment.
But the ether, or any absolute frame, becomes undetectable and so is
philosophically unattractive.  As you say, it is counter to the spirit
of SR even if perhaps technically compatible with the equations.

In that paper, http://xxx.lanl.gov/html/physics/9810010, the authors
emphasized the one aspect in which CAs are entirely compatible with
relativity, which is that they are inherently local.  The authors then
claimed to have a way to show that the speed of light would be the
same in all moving frames in their CA model, but I think they were just
talking through their hats.  (I'm surprised that a paper like this was
published in what I have found in the past to be a very reliable forum,
the LANL physics archive.)

I learned SR from the book I recommended earlier, Spacetime Physics,
and that book is permeated with the philosophical view that spacetime is
primary, that space and time are just different angles on the underlying
reality of spacetime.  (I mean this quite literally, different angles
in hyperbolic geometry.)

It does seem that the separation of space and time is inherent to the CA
model.  You could set up a four-dimensional CA array which might represent
spacetime in some sense, but then what would it mean for the CA to evolve?
You've already incorporated what we call "time" in the four dimensional
CA.  It just doesn't fit.

I wouldn't go this far.  I view relativity as being a concrete and really
rather prosaic theory, just one which does not map too well to our
mental models.  It is a problem with our minds, though, not a problem
with reality.  You have spacetime, you have matter, and you have rules
for how they influence each other.  Our conventional philosophical views
of the nature of reality are compatible with relativity, just not our
specific intuitions about how space and time behave.

A very interesting topic indeed.
The process of moving to different places has always been somewhat painful
for me.
I always try not to move too much... next year I will use distant learning
;))
And there is the old proverb : "the more you move, the less you learn".
(I've probably read that in Centuries by Attanasio ;)
Still we need to upgrade the relationship between our sensory-motor
abilities and what we learn as much as it is possible because it is probably
the most efficient way to do.
This could seem somewhat childish but i would like to see some kind of
remote sensory capabilities designed like in the game "descent". (a
doom-like but with 3 dimensions of freedom)
I would like to be able to control several descent-like probes (with
multitasking)
each robotic probes would have the ability to send me the information I
would need to feel in the place... audio and video woud be quite
sufficient... for the begining...
Such thing would be a major improvment for my learning... i would be able to
watch and interact with pals allowing such probes in their surrounding. So I
would not need to be limited to communicate only with networks users.
There is interesting questions about how to build such probes so that they
are secure in their environment and unable to harm people (using some kind
of GPS?)... how they would fly,..refuel capabilities, noise free, mass
production... ;))
I wonder how far away it is of the current technology. Of course there would
still exist social problems about such things ;(... a lot of "no probes"
allowed areas and the great majority would probably be quite reluctant to
that...

More practically, I would like to have the possibility of instantaneous
replay of all the experiences I had (video/audio).
perhaps some little cam on my head and wearable with huge memory storage
would be sufficient.
I would like, *at least*, to be able to search all my audio/video memories
like I search the web.
That could be develloped quite easily.


I'm sure i've not helped you much but remote sensing at distance is
something I would really like to have ;))

Well, thanks for agreeing with me about everything else, but...

Actually, I would probably say much the same thing if I came out of the
blue and made a statement like that.  The real reason I think that "laws
are stuff" is that back when I was trying to figure out how to define
"instantiation" for conscious entities, the one thing I kept running
into was the idea that you could define any sort of consciousness apart
from the algorithms composing it - two identical algorithms, one of
which was conscious, the other wasn't; consciousness as epiphenomenon. 
I hate this idea.  Any theory in which this idea shows up is wrong.

I intuit that the same holds true of reality.  A process which is "real"
will differ materially, in results and output, from a process which is
"not real".  Now, you can have one Turing algorithm which is "real" and
one that is "not real", and they'll both work exactly the same way;
reality is an optional add-on, just a matter of instantiation.  Thus I
don't believe in the Turing formalism.  It's no small wonder that the
Turing formalism can't answer questions about instantiation, or about
the First Cause, when it treats reality as an epiphenomenon.

Special Relativity keys into that, but only vaguely.  I could be wrong -
I probably am wrong - about the blur between Turing tick and Turing data
representing the blur between the laws of physics and material.  But
it's still one of the major intuitions, perhaps *the* intuition I use to
understand ontology:  Anything real can be detected, tested for, and
modified.  That goes for the laws of physics and the presence or absence
of "reality", just like it goes for anything else.

I've been thinking about how this would work for AIs.  You couldn't run
Elisson, but you could run a planetary EURISKO where everyone writes
their own heuristics.  On the first of every month, your spare CPU
cycles would go towards cracking that day's problem - the stock market,
say, or finding a new math theorem, or a VLSI circuit design, or
optimizing Debian Linux.  (This would be the price of licensing the
EURISKoid software; the makers could sell the planetary computing power
and open-source the software.)  And to answer your next question,
Intelligenesis's Webmind *is* a step in that direction, but it would
need a new programming language before it could do anything really useful.

Freeland, an Extropian outpost above Silicon Valley, is being offered for sale.

Situated in a private redwood grove in the 'emerald hills' above Redwood City, it was the site of a seminal extropian gathering in March of 1993, when the movement was smaller, younger, and, some say, more enthusiastic.  

At the time, several extropians expressed appreciation for the uncommonly secluded, private and tranquil setting.  I think it has many unusual features that will appeal to those freedom-loving types who want to be close to the valley.

This coming weekend, May 21-23, there will be an open house, and offers in the 550K range will be entertained.  I would rather that it stay in the 'family', so special consideration will be given to interested extropians.

Thanks for the bandwidth...

White house cracked

One of the web servers (www1) for the Whitehouse was cracked. According to 
information learned by HNN this crack took place at aprox 8:50am EST on May 
10th. (Other news outlets are claiming it happened at midnight EST on May 
9th) Unlike reports from about one month a ago that claimed whitehouse.gov 
was cracked this time there is enough viable evidence to support the 
allegation. CNN is reporting that whitehouse spokes people are blaming this 
on equipment failure. HNN has been able to secure a copy of the cracked 
page.


Here's the original page that was attacked;

http://www.whitehouse.gov/

And here's the left cracked page (per hacker news)

http://www.hackernews.com/archive/1999/whitehouse/gh.html


Also:
US Embassy and DOE web sites Cracked

In response to the recent NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade 
some people have started attacking web sites. The US Embassy in China, The 
DOE, and the Department of Interior are a few of the web sites that have had 
their web pages changed as a direct result of the bombings. Most of the 
slogans posted on the pages are extremely anti USA and NATO and and evoke 
Chinese nationalism and patriotism.

Interesting People is a list run by David Farber at the U of
Penn... as the name implies, membership is supposedly restricted
to "interesting people" as judged by Farber, who then send him
interesting tidbits regarding just about anything (but mostly
related to the net) that he sifts through and posts to the list.
Apparently someone on the list sent him your post, which he
distributed to all those "digerati". His home page is here:

Ah, okay I went to check it out. I see his IP networking community is 
restricted, so I emailed for more info.

Not really, I have the strong impression that what Einstein wanted was
the frame independence of physical laws, not to say anything about
space and simultaneity (which was the implications of the basic
postulates). If the physical laws behave different in one frame than
the others then relativity doesn't hold, but there could be a frame
that is special in some sense (like the CA "rest" frame) but this
special property cannot be detected from the inside of the world.

You could have a different grid, like a hyperbolic one where the CA
time does not correspond to the physical time. The cells would have a
connectivity that is not as simple as in ordinary euclidean CAs.

Unfortunately the archive is not peer-reviewed, so anybody can send in
stuff. I guess few real crackpots try to post to gr-qc eller hp-th,
but the physics subsection has shown a slow increase in the number of
unorthodox articles of varying quality.

You could have a 4D CA representing the whole of spacetime, and then the
evolution rule would correspond to a gradual refinement/convergence to
a stable state which corresponds to the entire history of the
universe.

My apologies for the wonderful last posting.  I realize it may be elegant in

Just found this today...

Can someone more knowledgeable than me take a look and give us an
opinion of whether this is really what it claims to be?

Looks legit to me, but what do I know?

There is an essay I like in Oliver Sachs' wonderful _The Man Who
Mistook His Wife for a Hat_ about a medical student with a transient
episode of "dog-like" smell. The description is evocative and really
shows the emotional impact of an amplified sense.  The cause in this
case was likely some drug use; as I mentioned in my April 1 "this
week's finds" dopamine is involved in smell regulation and drugs can
affect it.  I wonder if enhanced smell combined with pheromones under
voluntary control could be used to improve social interaction.

As for improving senses, there are likely three levels where they can
be improved. First, the sensors themselves can be amplified or
modified. Second, more attention spent on them - our sense of smell
isn't that bad really, but we seldom concentrate on it. Third,
processing can be improved. Maybe extra cortical processing, but also
more training in how to use the sense.

Overall, we need more attention as the world become more interesting.

I have always found skilled guides (or texts) essential for really
understanding art - they point out meaning and details of the artwork
that I would otherwise have missed, making it possible to really think
about it. Of course, great art is often obvious - it explains itself -
but when we learn more about something it becomes also more
accessible, new nuances appear and so on. Maybe the same would go for
enhanced senses: we need skilled guides who focus our attention to
particular nuances, suggests meanings and further associations so the
amplified world would not overwhelm us but would instead become more
comprehensible and expressive.

Why not? It is just that we need a better kind of gut feelings. One
little scene in Egan's _Diaspora_ which really delighted me was when a
character felt it had a great idea on "the tip of the tounge", just
waiting to burst into consciousness. So the character brought up a
visualization of its own mind and looked where the activation was -
aha! Maybe a similar kind of gut feeling - why do I feel bad about
that option? Let's take a look - aha, now I know why. Makes sense /
silly me, a mis-association again.

What person does not want the ability to live as they desire?

With a state of being that fulfills both sides of human duality (every human
consists of both a tangible physical existence and an intangible mental
existence).

Through some combination of machines, robots, computers, and/or other
technologies, humanity will have the ability to provide for all tangible
physical needs and desires. Nanotechnology is one such promising technology.
Molecular assemblers, microscopic machines, would build molecules by putting
atoms together. Just give this machine any type of matter, such as water, and it
can rearrange the atoms to make anything else, such as an apple, or gold. These
nanomachines can even make copies of themselves, so that once one is built,
Humanity can have all the nanomachines it wants. Every home could have a
machine, consisting of a very large quantity of these microscopic nanomachines,
to provide for all material needs. For example, if you want a glass of orange
juice simply tell the machine and it can use water from a water line connection
to make a glass filled with orange juice. When you are finished drinking the
juice, just put the glass in the machine, and the machine will turn the glass
back into clean water and send the water down the drain. People will never have
to shop again. New clothes, caviar, lobster, no problem, just tell the machine
to make whatever is wanted. These nanomachines will build miniature
super-computers, and robots of any desired size. People will not have to work
because these robots, computers and machines, will be able to perform any task
that needs to be done, or is desired to be done. However, if one desires to
work, these production methods can be used to create any work environment one
desires. Material poverty will be eliminated. Money, a medium of exchange for
material goods and services, will become obsolete, because every individual can
have all of their material needs and desires fulfilled by this unlimited
production capability. Taxes are no longer necessary. Nanomachines can patrol
the human body killing viruses, deleting any cancerous growths, and regenerating
damaged cells so that one never ages or gets sick. Pollution will not result
from this molecular manufacturing process, and these nanomachines can be
unleashed to clean up any preexisting pollution. There is no need to harvest
trees, or other natural resources, because nanomachines can make anything
desired. Animals will not have to be raised for slaughter to feed humans or
provide clothes, because nanomachines can make anything desired. This unlimited
production system just needs matter and energy to function These machines can
make solar panels and energy storage devices so efficient that the energy from
the sun will be the only power ever needed. The only other thing needed to run
the machines is some type of matter, which can be air, water, dirt, or anything
else that is plentiful. Fantastic engineering feats are possible, such as
see-through domes over cities to eliminate weather concerns, and an extensive
water piping system to eliminate drought and floods. Extraordinary amusement
parks and entertainment centers could be built with this technology. Space
exploration and colonization would be easily feasible with this technology. Etc.

Through some method or combination of methods, Humanity will have the ability to
provide for all  intangible mental needs and desires. Humanity will develop
methods to control and regulate feelings and emotions, increase intelligence,
and eliminate mental illness. People will have a mental heaven through
mind-shaping. People will have healthy minds free from any mental agony such as
depression, because all mental illness will be cured. Humans will discover how
to access and unleash the full capabilities and power of the brain, and thereby
reach levels of intelligence and thought that takes the essence of being to an
unimaginably complete state of existence. Humanity will be able to achieve
control of the brain so one can elect to have any feeling or emotion desired, or
elect to avoid any feeling or emotion. One will be able to have pure thought
unaffected by feelings or emotions, and unrestrained by sensory or other
limitations. Such mind-shaping methods may involve the use of chemicals and/or
genetic engineering to enhance the pleasure pathways of the brain, and block
negative feedback pathways. This would result is a perpetual state of happiness,
pleasure, and joy. Boredom, anger and other negative feelings and emotions will
no longer plague man. People will be happy about being in a state of happiness,
a perpetual love of everything. Humanity will develop sensory devices to enhance
mental abilities, and virtual reality systems for unlimited mental experiences.
Each individual will have the capability to completely control their thoughts,
and thereby be the god of their own universe, the king of their mental sphere of
existence.

Why do people with different values have to interface?  Instead of standard
rules for all places, humans could establish different rules for different
places so that each person can be in the type of place where there are rules of
conduct and behavior that suits their preference. The amount of technology one
wants in their life is purely a personal choice, and there should be technology
free zones for those who do not want technology in their lives. With the right
knowledge we can find ways for each person to live as they desire.

I said "proficient methods for dissemination". Computers offer an efficient and
economical way to store information, and the Internet provides a method for fast
and easy access to information. These methods are not being fully utilized. I
believe teaching can be made more efficient

Continual improvement is the highest good.

Which changes are considered improvements varies among individuals.

When making decisions, individuals attempt, with widely varying degrees
of success, to improve themselves and their environment.

The universe includes all individuals, and from its perspective, all its
parts are striving for their own versions of improvement.

If individuals become increasingly and continually successful at
improvement, they will continually approach their own ideals of goodness.

This process of successful improvement by individuals is the way the
universe (from its own perspective) becomes the highest good.

Civilization is a natural, biological phenomenon.
There is nothing in civilization that has not been a well established

To think of civilization as somehow "unnatural" shows a profound lack of

Prison Blues

Imagine yourself in this position. To your left is a sneak thief. To your
right a brute with a rap sheet of assaults and batteries. You are
surrounded
by a sea of humanity and dotted among this crowd are burglars, gang
members,
and at least a few rapists, all of whom claim they are innocent. Some in
the
crowd are slow, even stupid. Some are bright, but unlucky. Others, a
significant number, are just poor and fall somewhere in between.

You know you have unique talents, that you are different, even special,
but
in this huge facility you are lost in the crowd. You hope a guard will
recognize your value, your worth, and bestow upon you some privilege that
will let you exercise your innate skills. But, reality sets in. They have
jobs to do, regulations to adhere to. "Get back in line," they shout.
They
cannot give you special treatment. An institution like this is not able
to
let you explore and enhance those little qualities you possess. It
doesn't
matter that exercising that special talent will help you keep your
sanity.
That's not the purpose of this government institution.

Here the goals are simple. You are separated from society, segregated
from
the outside world. You are taught to respect and fear authority. You are
trained to be a model citizen, one that snaps to attention and follows
orders without question, though the orders rarely make any sense or have
any
relation to what you are actually doing. You are here to have your
individuality washed away. You are here to learn regimentation.

The outside world beckons to you. You can see it over the walls. Freedom.
Oh, how you wish you were there. You know you could keep a job. You know
you
could do the right thing and learn the ropes quickly, if given a chance.
But, you know that chance won't come. You are here for ten years. Ten
years.
Even so, you know you're lucky, in a fashion, because you got two years
knocked off for good behavior and hard work.

Until then your days are regimented, guarded, enclosed. A monotonous tone
sounds and you go to your first work station. Another sounds, you go to
your
second, your third, and so on. Finally, that cherished tone sounds and
you
get to go to the yard and breathe fresh air and listen to the world over
the
fences and beyond the wall. Welcome to public school.

He should have referred to them as "government schools" and mentioned

Besides the fact that you can go home at the end of the day, what is the
real difference 'twixt  gov't schools and gov't prisons?

This is an interesting question, and I would also pose the flipside
question: how is our intellectual and spiritual growth impacted as we
progress to an operational mode of doing more and more filtering and less
"immersive" processing of stimuli?  I.e. will we become more efficient
information processors at the expense of deeper meaning and understanding?
If this is true, and we become wide but shallow, it would almost certainly
affect our interactions. 

It's not that I believe these two "modes" can't exist together in an
intelligent being.  I think it would be quite effective to learn first
principals and then subsequently be able to filter out the the vast amounts
of redundant and useless information.  Unfortunately, it is all too common
to go for the quick fix and forego the deeper understanding.

Getting back to the original question, it would seem the choices for sensory
expansion are:

1. Enhance existing sensory capability, e.g. hearing more in the existing
audible range.

2. Extend capabilities to other parts of the spectrum for an existing
sensory capability, e.g. seeing in infrared.

3. Add an essentially new sensory capability, e.g. ?

For choices 2 and 3, there is also the choice of mapping the out-of-band
stimuli into the existing range or sequestering an unused (hopefully) part
of the brain and training it for the new sensory system.

    > 	What types of intelligent agents will assist us in

This would be more inline with the former, i.e. the agents would work with
the augmentation hardware to filter the information and map it into the
baseband of an existing sensory system.

This would be more inline with the latter, where the brain would get more
raw input but would have to process it "natively".

A cognitive enhancement I can think of that would cross various categories
is the capability to visualize effectively in multiple dimensions.

    > 
    > 	Is 'gut feeling' important in the advancement of ourselves?
    > (Instinct/Intuition) 

As I understand it there is still a school of thought that maintains that
all cognitive thought is essentially retrospect.  In this case everything is
"intuition", some just gets explained immediately afterwards. Regardless of
whether you believe that, it can probably be agreed that the 'gut instinct'
is the result of a subconscious result that has not been adequately
explained by the conscious.  It may be:
- A hardwired reaction
- An emotion-based response
- A logical conclusion that has not been effectively elucidated.

In each case, the result may be valid or invalid and useful or not useful.
It is also highly possible they really aren't distinct mechanism of the
subsconcious, just have different origins or labels.

The issue isn't that people want to live as they desire, it is that
their desires are not always compatible and sometimes mutually
exclusive. The desires of an ultra-green person who wants an Earth
free from humans is not compatible with the desires of the catholic
priest who thinks "multiply and fruitful" is a direct order from God.

And what about the people who seriously think this would be *bad*?
There are memes around that suggests hardships are good for you, and
that introduction of better material support will have spiritual bad
effects. I think and you seem to think they are utterly wrong, but
some people do hold this view.

Beware Nano Claus! Nanotechnology is certainly interesting and has the
potential (if it can be built) to change the world. But it is not
magic, it has limitations and practical constraints that will become
important.

Ok. But how do you tell it what orange juice is? Just because it could
physically build something doesn't mean it can do it. Somebody has to
write the program for orange juice - and that will likely cost you
something.

Then there is the issue of matter. Nanotech won't transmute elements,
and if you rely on tap water to get the atoms for your orange juice
you will have to wait for a long while until breakfast is ready
(unless your tap water is some kind of sewage). You will need a source
of material, and to get efficiency in the system it has to be well
defined and preprocessed. And to do the extraction of atoms, molecular
construction and information processing you will need energy - a
significant amount of energy, which will have to come from somewhere.

The problem here is that you assume that just because you have the
tools that could do something, it will be easy and efficient to
do. AI, robots, cell-repair, easy-to-use and safe nanocompilers,
orange juice - all that takes plenty of intelligence and skill to
design, test and market, as well as matter and energy. A nanotech
economy would be very different from the current economy (and a lot of
stuff like caviar might very well exist in a public domain form), but
it wouldn't be a place where fried sparrows jumped into your mouth. A
steak might be cheap, but having the steak cooked by a real chef in a
nice restaurant with ambience will not be for free.

How do we know this?

...

I agree with you about these things. But it won't mean that every
intangible need will be satisfied. New needs will appear, and some
people might opt out of these enhancement, for example due to
religious reasons ("God wanted us to feel miserable!").

Exactly my view. The trouble is, Ludwig the Luddite thinks *nobody*
should have advanced technology, and Sophie Socialist thinks she and
her friends are the only moral group to distribute the property among
the masses. Many people even think that everybody should follow the
same ethics. It is the ideologies and views that think they have to be
all encompassing that are the problem.

Still, I think it is possible to achieve a stable meta-society that
enables different views to co-exist reasonably well. That is an
important goal of transhumanism.

That statement is so totally tautological that it's worthless; by definition,
people desire their desires.

Yehaaa!! I want my own universe and I want it now. Gimme, gimme, gimme...

Yow! Not just lead into gold folks, but *WATER* into gold.

Machine, I want a Jupiter-sized brain. No, I don't care if you have to
dismantle all my neighbors and the rest of the planet to build it, just
get on and do it. You are there to provide for all my material needs, and
I expect you to do it.

Why is it that these utopias which are going to provide for all our needs
are always proposed by people whose idea of 'needs' isn't very imaginative?

Do you have a clue about chemistry? Hint: Water is also known as H20 because
it consists of Hydrogen atoms and Oxygen atoms. You have a hard time making
a glass out of hydrogen and oxygen.

So you replace human work with SI work? What are you going to do when those

some kind of carbon chauvinist?

We don't send them out, essentially. It seems more prudent to look out 
for signatures they cannot avoid than for signals that 'meant' to be
found -- I don't think that looking around the hydrogen line is
extremely smart. There is a lot of hydrogen out there...

I have improved my senses quite significantly over the past few years.
It seems that our senses detect much more than we usually are consciously
aware of.
We routinely ignore most of our sensory world and instead focus on
whatever aspects of it we choose to be interested in.
Learning to pay attention to more of the details of sensory experience is
the key to enhancing your senses.
Learn to pay attention to that which you judge to be "irrelevant detail".
Notice the subtleties of texture of all the objects around you, not just
the general shape, color and position of the objects.
Learn to listen carefully to all the subtle sounds around you.
Pay attention to your senses, and you will automatically develop a
greater capacity to pay attention to your senses.
Continue this practice for years, and you will notice a profound
difference.
Even after a few days or weeks of intense sensory focus, and the
difference in the quality of your sensory experiences will be evident.
It is important to pay attention to as much as you possibly can, to let
yourself be immersed in your sensory world.
Going for walks alone to practice paying attention to your senses can be
very helpful.
There are many other exercises that can be done to deliberately improve
your senses.
It's mostly a matter of practicing using your senses.
When you find yourself daydreaming, simply switch your focus to your
senses.
Work on seeing all the details of things you see; eventually you will see
them with no effort.
All your senses can be improved simply by learning to pay greater
attention to the information that they already detect.

The effects of enhanced senses include the experience of a richer, more
detailed world, a greater awareness of that which is usually ignored, an
increasingly accurate perception of one's world, and many other benefits.

I reeallly like this idea.  In fact, I love this idea.  I think that's
the most brilliant foundation for a Theory of Everything I've ever
heard.  Better than string theory, twistors, Moravec or even Egan.

I don't think it's *true*, mind you.  But I bet if a real physicist were
to shake it a bit all sorts of interesting things would fall out.

Wow! Thanks! That was the best compliment I have heard in the long time.

Yes. I doodled a bit with it, and given the physical laws we observe
it seems possible to set up some constraints on the CA rule.

If the enhanced senses are the result of near-term enhancements such as
wear-
able computers/sensors, people will need to train themselves to
multitask between
multiple screens.  The best solution at this level of enhancement is a
sort of synesthesia, presenting the new data as a
visual, audio or tactile signal, since we
already have a fair amount of bandwidth
for these sensory channels.  Please see the 'cyborg in search of
community' thread
for a more indepth discussion on this level of enhancement.

In the somewhat longer term involving implanted sensors, the need would
be for some onboard processor interfaced to the nervous system to
provide the bandwidth needed;  this would be in addition to the sort of
synesthesia/multitasking approach
held over from wearables.

In the longer term involving enhancements from genetic redesign from the
ground up,
there are 2 levels of difficulty:

those born with the enhancements (designer offspring) will probably just
adapt to their new sense modes without thinking about it, like learning
to speak, walk, etc.  The plasticity of the brain at that stage of life
should be all they need.

those who are upgraded later in life (us)
will probably still require an extra processor to handle the increased
data.  It
will probably be possible to return the brain to a state of plasticity
like that of a newborn, enabling  a similar learning experience, but I
wonder if that increased plasticity would preserve the older connections
which, to some extent at least, constitute our identities.  Perhaps the
old patterns would be backed up onto the implanted processor (didn't
Greg Egan
do a couple of stories along these lines?)

Either way, the subjective experience of a being with such an inherently
different sensorium is a bit difficult to imagine.  To
be given a new sense as an adul without an upgrade in processing power
would produce problems akin to those experienced by the fellow in 'At
First Sight'
(blind from birth, sight restored as an adult, extreme difficulty
adjusting led to the real-life person whose tory this was to reteat into
an hysterical blindness).

Dear Jon,

I'm glad you're excited about the prospects of the future.  We all are.  But you're
preaching to the choir.  I hope that no more than 1% of the list doesn't already 
know this stuff.

There are some important gotchas in what you've written, however.  Which, 
again, were discussed to death on the list eight years ago. 

(1)  Middle-of-the-road nanotechnology is not alchemy.  

>Just give this machine any type of matter, such as water, and it
>can rearrange the atoms to make anything else, such as an apple, or gold. 

Unless you're relying on the trivial traces of carbon, gold, etc. that may be present in
tap water, you will not get apples or gold from rearranging atoms.  There are far-out
speculations about sub-nano technology that works on quarks, but it's still bad
science fiction for now.

(2)  You have many generalizations about the social consequences of nanotech
that much of the group would disagree with.

>People will never have to shop again. 
>People will not have to work 
>Material poverty will be eliminated. 
>Money, a medium of exchange for material goods and services, will become obsolete,
>Taxes are no longer necessary. 
>all mental illness will be cured. 

Pointing out just a few of the fallacies:

a. There is no limit to how much material wealth someone might want.  Only a few of
    us can have brains the size of Jupiter in this solar system.
b. Unless sub-nano tech comes along and is cheap, rare elements are still valuable.
c. Information is always of value.
d. Location is still unique (although arguably less important).
e. Personal service is still relevant.
f. Nanotech and associated developments are not a guarantee against busy-bodies who 
   want to control others "for their own good" and other human behavioral pathologies.

Little green mice that are a glowing tribute to science
Daily Mail

SCIENTISTS have created green mice using a revolutionary new genetic 
engineering technique revealed yesterday.

The mice developed their unusual colour after a fluorescent gene taken from 
jellyfish was injected into their cells. When illuminated by ultraviolet 
light, scientists found that the creatures glowed green.

The green gene, however, was merely a marker. It was being used to 
demonstrate that a new technique using sperm cells to transfer genetic 
material worked.

It proved that scientists at the University of Hawaii had created a simpler 
and more straightforward method, which was reported yesterday in the journal 
Science, than the one previously used.

Usually when scientists want to modify an animal they inject DNA into the 
nucleus of a fertilised egg cell, which then develops into an embryo 
containing the new gene.

The method works well in mice but is more difficult in larger mammals such 
as cows and pigs. Their fertilised egg cells are opaque, making the nucleus 
harder to find.

The new technique, however, involves a form of in-vitro fertilisation.

In it, sperm heads whose cell coats have been disrupted by freezing or 
treating with chemicals are mixed with DNA.

That mixture is then injected into an unfertilised egg cell using an IVF 
technique called intracytoplasmic sperm injection.

Some of the DNA penetrates the sperm heads, which fertilise the egg and 
consequently incorporate the new genetic material.

'The great thing about this method is that it is very straightforward. It 
may prove to be more efficient,' said Professor Tony Perry, one of the 
research team.

The technique could have major implications for the use of mouse models to 
study human genes and the breeding of genetically engineered pigs whose 
organs can be transplanted into humans.

I don't know about that.  Certainly I challenge the phrase "bad" science
fiction, because it's been done well a couple of times... but that's not
the point.

I know of at least two instances of sub-molecular technology.  (1)
artificial atoms; (2) sculpted quantum states.  (Unfortunately my links
appear to be broken - sorry, guys!  (1) is changing the shape of a
single atom's wavefunction, and (2) is doing some kind of custom stuff
on probability distributions, I think.  Anyone have a valid link?)

Not hydrogen-into-gold (does jon have any idea how much energy that
would release? it'd be orders of magnitude more than an equivalent
thermonuclear hydrogen-to-helium), not even close, but it strikes me as
a good reason to believe that nucleus-manipulating "atomic
picotechnology" would be an active frontier once atom-manipulating
"molecular nanotechnology" matured.

What the heck does he - does *any* race with that kind of technology -
want with gold, anyway?

The fun part is that sculpting electron clouds like the recent
theoretical ideas suggest could even be useful - lots of potential for
odd chemistry, atomic manipulation, quantum computation and
everything. It doesn't have to involve the nucleus to be interesting.

Nice conductor. One of the few metals where you can see relativistic
effects visibly (I seem to recall; it was a while since I read up on
why gold and copper look like they do, I might be wrong here).

Actually, it wouldn't be orders of magnitude more. It might actually take quite a bit of extra energy to complete. The energy break-even point for fusion is at the level of iron. Gold is decidedly further up the elemental scale than that, in the area of lead (the common byproduct of the uranium fission series). It might be simpler to tailor high level element isotopes that will degrade into gold. I doubt it is that simple though, or nature would have produced a lot more gold than there is.

> What the heck does he - does *any* race with that kind of technology -

gold is the best metallic electrical conductor, its easily alloyable and malleable, which is of obvious use to any technologist.

IMHO he would be far smarter to want to develop nanotechnology that burrows and swims for the expressed purpose of recovering gold from deep down and laying golden eggs on the Earth's surface. The gold content of the manganese nodules that litter the Abyssal Plains of the deep oceans is of immense value. Getting all that metal to the surface is another issue entirely, and one that may have no real cost effective need for the time being, now that the Russian economy and its resources are open to the west. When I was a child, gold was over $800.00 an ounce (over 20 years ago). Friday the spot price of gold was a mere $277 and change.  The Russians are dumping gold and other precious metals on the world market to keep their economy afloat, and their mines are only getting bigger.

I recall in Larry Niven's _A Gift from Earth_, the inhabitants of the planet Plateau used specially bred worms that burrowed for specific metals, refining and excreting them.

Actually, the binding energy curve changes slope around iron (56|26 Fe, I
seem to recall) and fusing nuclei heavier than iron actually consumes
energy. See for example
http://www.ucdsb.on.ca/tiss/stretton/chem2/nuc03.htm (which calls out Au
specifically).

If Ufog or some other generic smart-matter scenario, ever becomes common then probably much matter that is not being actively used will be held in common. Ufog-rentum?

Thanks.  I've been out of the loop for a while, and missed these.  (Catching
up now, asap.)

Perhaps, but I hazard that people will be trying to change the shape of 
a single atom's wavefunction any day now, if they aren't already.  And
that they will succeed well before the first molecular assembler is built.

Why?  Scientists vs. engineers.  Subatomic tinkering is a natural next
step for people who are tired of drawing pictures with xenon atoms
and don't care about the "trivial implementation details" in achieving
commercial nanotech.

The only time I've read the phrase "artificial atom" was in discussions of
quantum dots, where multiple silicon atoms and their cohorts are arranged to
shape an electron's view of the world.  So a dot with one electron is an
artificial hydrogen atom, and there was vague talk about being able to make
higher artificial 'atoms' or molecules.  Wait, maybe that's what you mean by
(2).  Well, I've never seen them separate.  

I remember something recent about writing information into the electron
cloud of an atom.
 
Both are still entirely QED based -- pure electron manipulation.  I've never
read of a hint of practical nucleonic technology.  We can smash things
inefficiently, or use natural fissiles, and maybe someday we'll be able to
usefully fuse H, and that's it out to the current horizon.

As others have said, nope.  H is at the top of the potential energy curve, iron
is at the bottom (I don't know if some trans-transuranic could be lower.)
Just going to helium takes you 3/4 of the way down the well.  From the chart
lubkin posted, Au is perhaps halfway between He and Fe.

Yes, but by your understanding everything that biological entities do _is_
natural.  Ergo, of what use is the term?

In my view, people use "natural" in three ways.  One is the technical sense,
i.e., something is natural if it is part of the natural world.  By this view,
anything that is, from rocks to space shuttles is natural.  The things that
would be unnatural would be things that exist outside of the natural
world, outside of reality.

Another is the more common place usage, which just means whatever
the user of the term believes to be normal or acceptable.  Under this
usage, to the average Americans, e.g., polygamy is not natural, while
monogamy is.

The third is to mean not human made.  By this definition, rocks are
natural, but space shuttles are not.  This is perhaps as commonly if not
more commonly used by most people.

Huxley was probably implicitly thinking in terms of the third usage, but
the lines were blurry because in the time he was operating most
people considered there to be a strong separation between the
realm of human society and everything else.  In essense, if we look
at it this way, we can see Huxley, who didn't have the benefit of
ethological studies and the like, likening human civilization -- the
only one we know of at any rate -- as something sui generis.  To
use a metaphor, it's almost like someone comparing prokaryotes
to eukaryotes.  The differences might astound her so much that
she fails to remember the similarities and continuities.

Aside from that, it's just one quote.  We'd have to read the context
to know what the heck he's rambling on about.

Anyway, take a deep breath...   This too shall pass.

Cheers!

What use is the term indeed? It's become feel good term which means
absolutely nothing. See also "Organic".

Umm, have you got another metaphor to explain this one? I seem to be

Mark said (also out of context):
And what do you do when you don't have enough resources (e.g. I want to 
a Jupiter-sized brain to run universe simulations, and I want it *now*),

And also said (you guessed it, out of context)
Machine, I want a Jupiter-sized brain. No, I don't care if you have to
dismantle all my neighbors and the rest of the planet to build it, just
get on and do it. You are there to provide for all my material needs,
and
I expect you to do it.

I'm a bit worried about all this talk of Jupiter sized brains (although
I'm guilty of it myself). 

Wouldn't such a thing be a target? If someone was annoying you who was
dependent on a Jupiter sized brain, then wouldn't you be tempted to lob
a couple of fusion bombs at it (sorry all you pacifists out there). 

Also, in my experience, computers have been getting *smaller* as time
wends its way towards whatever it wends its way towards. While we're all
doing this "my brain's bigger than yours" stuff, transhumans might be
more impressed by tiny, weeny little brains. "I've got the new
google-flops processor(s) running my brain, it's made out of quarks, and
is the size of the head of a match - oh wait, I've dropped it, hey,
guys, can you help me find my brain, it's here somewhere, no, don't step
there, aaarrgghhhh *gurgle*).

Anyway, surely it would play hell with your neck muscles.

This is just the sculpting of the quantum wave function of the electrons orbiting the nuclei using laser pulses and feedback. Its very useful for tailoring the catalyzation of chemical reactions to allow for in process quality control, eliminating impurities and unwanted alternate reactions. It does not change the actual properties of the matter itself. The sort of wave functions we are talking about it to change the wave function of the nucleus itself to change the elemental properties (atomic number, mass, isotope, etc). I don't know if the atom lasers developed from Bose-Einstein condensates would be useful for this. Anyone?

Universal Assemblers
These second-generation nanomachines - built of more than just proteins - 
will do all that proteins can do, and more. In particular, some will serve 
as improved devices for assembling molecular structures. Able to tolerate 
acid or vacuum, freezing or baking, depending on design, enzyme-like 
second-generation machines will be able to use as "tools" almost any of the 
reactive molecules used by chemists - but they will wield them with the 
precision of programmed machines. They will be able to bond atoms together 
in virtually any stable pattern, adding a few at a time to the surface of a 
workpiece until a complex structure is complete. Think of such nanomachines 
as assemblers.

Because assemblers will let us place atoms in almost any reasonable 
arrangement (as discussed in the Notes), they will let us build almost 
anything that the laws of nature allow to exist. In particular, they will 
let us build almost anything we can design - including more assemblers. The 
consequences of this will be profound, because our crude tools have let us 
explore only a small part of the range of possibilities that natural law 
permits. Assemblers will open a world of new technologies.

Advances in the technologies of medicine, space, computation, and production 
- and warfare - all depend on our ability to arrange atoms. With assemblers, 
we will be able to remake our world or destroy it. So at this point it seems 
wise to step back and look at the prospect as clearly as we can, so we can 
be sure that assemblers and nanotechnology are not a mere futurological 
mirage.

>From Drexler book Engines of Creation

As nanotechnology moves beyond reliance on proteins, it will grow more 
ordinary from an engineer's point of view. Molecules will be assembled like 
the components of an erector set, and well-bonded parts will stay put. Just 
as ordinary tools can build ordinary machines from parts, so molecular tools 
will bond molecules together to make tiny gears, motors, levers, and 
casings, and assemble them to make complex machines.

Parts containing only a few atoms will be lumpy, but engineers can work with 
lumpy parts if they have smooth bearings to support them. Conveniently 
enough, some bonds between atoms make fine bearings; a part can be mounted 
by means of a single chemical bond that will let it turn freely and 
smoothly. Since a bearing can be made using only two atoms (and since moving 
parts need have only a few atoms), nanomachines can indeed have mechanical 
components of molecular size.

How will these better machines be built? Over the years, engineers have used 
technology to improve technology. They have used metal tools to shape metal 
into better tools, and computers to design and program better computers. 
They will likewise use protein nanomachines to build better nanomachines. 
Enzymes show the way: they assemble large molecules by "grabbing" small 
molecules from the water around them, then holding them together so that a 
bond forms. Enzymes assemble DNA, RNA, proteins, fats, hormones, and 
chlorophyll in this way - indeed, virtually the whole range of molecules 
found in living things.

Biochemical engineers, then, will construct new enzymes to assemble new 
patterns of atoms. For example, they might make an enzyme-like machine which 
will add carbon atoms to a small spot, layer on layer. If bonded correctly, 
the atoms will build up to form a fine, flexible diamond fiber having over 
fifty times as much strength as the same weight of aluminum. Aerospace 
companies will line up to buy such fibers by the ton to make advanced 
composites. (This shows one small reason why military competition will drive 
molecular technology forward, as it has driven so many fields in the past.)

But the great advance will come when protein machines are able to make 
structures more complex than mere fibers. These programmable protein 
machines will resemble ribosomes programmed by RNA, or the older generation 
of automated machine tools programmed by punched tapes. They will open a new 
world of possibilities, letting engineers escape the limitations of proteins 
to build rugged, compact machines with straightforward designs.

Engineered proteins will split and join molecules as enzymes do. Existing 
proteins bind a variety of smaller molecules, using them as chemical tools; 
newly engineered proteins will use all these tools and more.

Further, organic chemists have shown that chemical reactions can produce 
remarkable results even without nanomachines to guide the molecules. 
Chemists have no direct control over the tumbling motions of molecules in a 
liquid, and so the molecules are free to react in any way they can, 
depending on how they bump together. Yet chemists nonetheless coax reacting 
molecules to form regular structures such as cubic and dodecahedral 
molecules, and to form unlikely-seeming structures such as molecular rings 
with highly strained bonds. Molecular machines will have still greater 
versatility in bondmaking, because they can use similar molecular motions to 
make bonds, but can guide these motions in ways that chemists cannot.

Indeed, because chemists cannot yet direct molecular motions, they can 
seldom assemble complex molecules according to specific plans. The largest 
molecules they can make with specific, complex patterns are all linear 
chains. Chemists form these patterns (as in gene machines) by adding 
molecules in sequence, one at a time, to a growing chain. With only one 
possible bonding site per chain, they can be sure to add the next piece in 
the right place.

But if a rounded, lumpy molecule has (say) a hundred hydrogen atoms on its 
surface, how can chemists split off just one particular atom (the one five 
up and three across from the bump on the front) to add something in its 
place? Stirring simple chemicals together will seldom do the job, because 
small molecules can seldom select specific places to react with a large 
molecule. But protein machines will be more choosy.

A flexible, programmable protein machine will grasp a large molecule (the 
workpiece) while bringing a small molecule up against it in just the right 
place. Like an enzyme, it will then bond the molecules together. By bonding 
molecule after molecule to the workpiece, the machine will assemble a larger 
and larger structure while keeping complete control of how its atoms are 
arranged. This is the key ability that chemists have lacked.

Like ribosomes, such nanomachines can work under the direction of molecular 
tapes. Unlike ribosomes, they will handle a wide variety of small molecules 
(not just amino acids) and will join them to the workpiece anywhere desired, 
not just to the end of a chain. Protein machines will thus combine the 
splitting and joining abilities of enzymes with the programmability of 
ribosomes. But whereas ribosomes can build only the loose folds of a 
protein, these protein machines will build small, solid objects of metal, 
ceramic, or diamond - invisibly small, but rugged.

Where our fingers of flesh are likely to bruise or burn, we turn to steel 
tongs. Where protein machines are likely to crush or disintegrate, we will 
turn to nanomachines made of tougher stuff.

This step forward, the ability to push atoms around, is the basic first step 
towards building molecular machines (nanotechnology). The problem left now, 
is how do we bond these together, to build? Moving down to the subatomic 
level, may or may not be the next step. Top down or to bottoms up, should we 
skip? Why not keep delving into all aspects? I think there is a lot more to 
learn at the atomic level, aside from abandoning it.

>From Engines of creation (K. Eric Drexler)
______________________________________________________________________
° Will the uncertainty principle of quantum physics make molecular machines 
unworkable?

This principle states (among other things) that particles can't be pinned 
down in an exact location for any length of time. It limits what molecular 
machines can do, just as it limits what anything else can do. Nonetheless, 
calculations show that the uncertainty principle places few important limits 
on how well atoms can be held in place, at least for the purposes outlined 
here. The uncertainty principle makes electron positions quite fuzzy, and in 
fact this fuzziness determines the very size and structure of atoms. An atom 
as a whole, however, has a comparatively definite position set by its 
comparatively massive nucleus. If atoms didn't stay put fairly well, 
molecules would not exist. One needn't study quantum mechanics to trust 
these conclusions, because molecular machines in the cell demonstrate that 
molecular machines work.

______________________________________________________________________

Cells replicate. Their machines copy their DNA, which directs their 
ribosomal machinery to build other machines from simpler molecules. These 
machines and molecules are held in a fluid-filled bag. Its membrane lets in 
fuel molecules and parts for more nanomachines, DNA, membrane, and so forth; 
it lets out spent fuel and scrapped components. A cell replicates by copying 
the parts inside its membrane bag, sorting them into two clumps, and then 
pinching the bag in two. Artificial replicators could be built to work in a 
similar way, but using assemblers instead of ribosomes. In this way, we 
could build cell-like replicators that are not limited to molecular 
machinery made from the soft, moist folds of protein molecules.

______________________________________________________________________

Some of these replicators will not resemble cells at all, but will instead 
resemble factories shrunk to cellular size. They will contain nanomachines 
mounted on a molecular framework and conveyor belts to move parts from 
machine to machine. Outside, they will have a set of assembler arms for 
building replicas of themselves, an atom or a section at a time.

In the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, silver is listed as having a
higher electrical conductivity than gold as well as a higher thermal
conductivity, but the differences are not large.

"Knowing the path is not the same as walking the path."

In many science-fiction novels, psychoses and neuroses are presented as a 
things of the past, and the humans of the future are shown to be much more 
sane and psychologically balanced than those of today.

Has any good novel ever tried to envision what a psychotherapy of the future 
would look like, or what conditions would make this general increase in 
sanity possible?

I remember being fascinated by Van Vogt's "World of A", and the idea that a 
kind of mental discipline (in this case, general semantics) could make people 
much more rational, psychologically healthy and even intelligent than the 
average individual. This led me to read Korzybski's "Science and Sanity" in 
my late teens and subscribe to the periodical of the general semantics 
society.

My infatuation with this movement soon subsided, but I have retained the 
ideal of such a mental panacea.

Has such a preventive psychiatry been depicted in science-fiction, or has any 
current psychologist tried to develop one?

Sincerely,

Jean-Francois Virey,
Douai, France.

An interesting movie regarding this I think is Gattaca. In it,
the people can choose what types of kids to have, and as per
Eliezer's ideas, you can't have it all... they pick skills for
their kids that focus on mastery of science and math and also
physical stats. The result seems to be people lacking "deepness"

It does, but who knows?

I would certainly try it out for less secure communications to see their
intentions.

They use the Thawte Consulting cc, Cape Town, South Africa as their CA.
This makes it minimally securer for those of you who feel that the USA

I'm rather surprised at that, I'll have to check my electrical engineering texts...And I forgot the other advantage that gold has over silver: it doesn't corrode.

My impression was that was more of an artifact of their knowing their 'destiny' of comfort and success. The genetic screening process automatically filtered out much competition from the less genetically well endowed classes, making pressure to succeed less. Character is based more on the shit you wade through than the sunshine you wallow in.

The most obvious recent example, I'd guess, is Greg Bear's impressive QUEEN
OF ANGELS (where the rich are routinely `therapied'), and its sequel SLANT
(or /), where this process is breaking down - or being evaded - and causing
major problems.

Theodore Sturgeon, of course, was greatly interested in such issues back in
the fifties (`The Other Man', etc).  And dear old uber-Ron, after all,
started as an sf hack, and lured van Vogt in his wake... (which might have
steered a lot of sensible people away from the topic).

The description in L. Ron Hubbard's book Dianetics reminds me very much of
the "cognitive therapy", which, apparently, rather successfully cleared up
some humans' mental problems, such as climical depression.

Highly doubtful.  It's potentially the best *explanatory* system, in the
broad.  But it offers very little of practical benefit, as yet.
Transmitter-modulators and cognitive/emotional discursive methods are not
incredibly effective, but they are the coal-face for intervention.
Speculations about life in the Pleistocene, however engaing and brilliant,
don't help a depressive get out of the trough.

	Resolving Conflicts Peacefully

	The fact that different people have different and often conflicting
desires for themselves and their world has been a problem for all of
human history.  This issue continues to become more urgent as the
population increases and the conflicts become more numerous and
widespread.  How humans respond to this increasingly tense situation will
have long-lasting effects.  

	Humans have often responded to their conflicts with violence, and many
people are conditioned to believe that this is an appropriate and
expected response to conflict.  Of course, the mountains of historical
evidence are at least as high as the mountains of dead bodies, that
violence only increases the levels of hostility between humans as well as
the body count from our perpetual wars.  

	Resolving conflicts peacefully is the first lesson of martial arts,
because angry humans are so dangerous.  Humans must learn this lesson
well, for their own safety.  Resolving conflicts peacefully is a lesson
that can be practiced every day, anytime a conflict arises.  

	The skills of diplomacy are important survival skills, and it is
important that people are deliberately taught these skills.  Diplomacy
can be taught in schools; it can be taught in movies and television
shows; it can be taught to anyone we personally have conflicts with, by
our own examples of diplomacy.  Diplomacy can be taught in many ways, and
it is important that we utilize as many methods as necessary to ensure a
peaceful world.

	Human life is valuable.  Acts of violence show profound ignorance of

I suppose it depends on what you're trying to accomplish.  Remember, I
don't give a damn about stopping depression.  Quite the opposite.  *All*
I care about is raising intelligence - in this case, that aspect of
intelligence known as self-awareness.  For that, you want to be able to
sort out which parts of your thinking are really *you* and which parts
are some script that hasn't been valid in 10,000 years.  I find
evolutionary psychology to be extraordinarily useful in keeping a clean mind.

Question:

The concept of memes seems to be quite useful in organizing thinking
about ideas and beliefs and how they spread. But I have never seen or
heard of any scientific models which have explicitly incorporated memes
as a unit of analysis. Does anyone know whether it has been done, and
what the results were?

It seems to me that "memetic modelling" should help sociologists and
especially linguists tremendously by formalizing their own theories, and yet
I have never seen any of it. Why?

A tautology is essentially a way of pointing out the obvious.  I don't
see why this is "worthless".  What is obvious to some is not obvious to
others.  In fact, I am constantly amazed at people's general lack of
awareness of obvious facts.  I have also noticed that people often
respond in anger when the obvious is pointed out to them.  I wonder if
this response explains the general lack of awareness of the obvious.

I would dispute that on the basis that theories of social status and
depression suggest intervention quite opposite to those currently practiced
by "counselors".

The biggest trouble with therapy is that is is chronically insulated  from
reality via such linguistic non-senses as validating all positions on the
basis that they are "news of difference" (told to me by a senior academic
just last week as justification for including psychoanalysis as a year III
paper at this institution).

Also, and perhaps more apposite, in recent discussions with the chief
research psychologist of a large maximum security hospital, i learned that
he is applying  "Speculations about life in the Pleistocene" not only in
therapy but also in diagnosis and research.

Even if the outcome of this is an acceptance that nothing can be done bar
gene transplants (and that is not the case), we would still have more
validity pretending that discussing "widlers" or desensitizing our eye
movements are effective interventions.

Using biological psychology (not evolutionary psychology which is full of PC
cop outs) is far far better than the alternative clinical "philosophies"
which are designed specifically to insulate knowledge claims from reality
tests (read for instance of Freud's own  falsification of critical case
studies (Frederick C. Crews (1998). Unauthorized Freud : Doubters Confront a
Legend

mark, now you're just being silly (although you do make a good point).  I
wonder, though, how optimistic you are about the future.  It seems like
you attack anyone who proposes that things will turn out very well for
everyone.  Or perhaps you simply disagree with the means they propose for
things turning out well for everyone.

Cognitive therapy makes a lot of sense really, and I think it is
useful for transhumanists to learn a bit about it. The basic idea is
to find out what thought-patterns you have, and do something about the
inefficient/destructive ones. Then you can of course coat it with
jargon and religion like Hubbard did, but the basic ideas are the
important bit.

Nobody is suggesting that we abandon nuclear chemistry, but it doesn't
seem likely to produce the same benefits that molecular nanotechnology
promises and appears to be less easy to achieve. Hence more interest
in molecular nanotechnology.

A fascinating and attractive idea.  Because I ride my bicycle on the
street often, and because I have frequently been reminded of the fact
that large numbers of motorists drive as though I am not there, I have
often longed for this ability.  But, like always, I must make do with
what I have, so I have spent a lot of time developing my sense of hearing
and my ability to generate a rough model of my surroundings based on
auditory information.  Now when I hear cars around me, I have a much
better knowledge of where they are, how fast they are moving and which
direction they are moving.

Technological augmentation of sensory abilities is certainly exciting,
and so is the fuller development and utilization of our existing senses. 
We are not ready for the new until we can excell with what we already

Walter John Williams' _Aristoi_ has an interesting take on
things. Beside having a stable, wealthy society where every child is
wanted (due to a low reproduction rate) which of course in itself
promotes mental health to a large extent, people used various mental
techniques to control their emotions and thinking. From an early age
they learned tricks like meditation, posture and other mental
exercises, as well as having a language/symbolism that had been
deliberately designed to make discussing psychological states and
techniques easy. In addition, people had deliberately created multiple
personalities - the various aspects of the psyche could be separated
(through more or less radical means, ranging from hypnosis to
gruelling rituals) and then employed as semi-independent
subpersonalities connected to AI.

Walter John Williams' _Aristoi_ has an interesting take on
things. Beside having a stable, wealthy society where every child is
wanted (due to a low reproduction rate) which of course in itself
promotes mental health to a large extent, people used various mental
techniques to control their emotions and thinking. From an early age
they learned tricks like meditation, posture and other mental
exercises, as well as having a language/symbolism that had been
deliberately designed to make discussing psychological states and
techniques easy. In addition, people had deliberately created multiple
personalities - the various aspects of the psyche could be separated
(through more or less radical means, ranging from hypnosis to
gruelling rituals) and then employed as semi-independent
subpersonalities connected to AI.

Yes, a huge system is a visible target if there are nasty people
around. Whether this is a big problem or not is a function of the
number of nasties, the offensive strength they can wield and the
defensive strength of the jupiter brain. A complicated problem.

But a jupiter-sized brain is not likely unless there is a strong need
for very fast and dense communications. A more likely structure
(assuming just molecular nanotechnology) is a cluster of
asteroid-sized systems. And distribution, redundancy and
error-correction would make it much less vulnerable.

:-) Actually, there are a limit to how small brains can become. At the
very least Bekenstein's bound on the information density, but more
likely due to stuff like quantum noise and physical properties of the
materials we can get. And once this is reached, the brains will start
to grow. Whether they ever become macroscopic (and somebody can ever
afford the luxury of having a jupiter brain for itself rather than
distributing across the networks) is another matter.

Being blessed/cursed with mental illness myself (bipolar disorder),
sanity doesn't come as automatically for me as it seems to come for
others.  Having worked for years on becoming more sane, I have had to
take advantage of many forms of mental discipline to remain sane in spite
of pretty much always feeling like I am on some sort of psychedelic drug.

Learning how to focus deeply on the reality of the current moment has
been of immense help to me in my efforts to develop greater sanity. 
Engaging in lots of problem solving activities has also helped me develop
a feeling of confidence that none of my problems are insurmountable (so
that I don't give up on my own sanity).  Engaging in lots of
communication with others has helped me refine my thinking and has helped
me utilize the solutions that others have discovered to their own,
similar problems.  I try everything that I think will work, and I work to
improve all methods I try.

Yes, though it would take a lot more than a couple of fusion bombs to do
anything more than annoy it; just look at how little damage Jupiter
suffered from those cometary impacts a while back.

Personally I'm not terribly interested in Jupiter-sized brains myself, I'm
just pointing out that the utopians who tell us that everyone will have all
their needs and desires fulfilled obviously don't have a clue as to just
how much some people will desire. What they're really saying is 'I don't
have very big needs and desires, so if I multiply that by n billion then
we can easily meet everyone's needs and desires, if only they think just
like me'. Then, of course, they have to stop anyone with greater needs and
desires from acting upon them because that would tear their utopia apart.

Of course the J-brain would have appropriate defenses (like a massive cloud
of nanites and other bots surrounding it), so you'd need a lot more than a 
couple of fusion bombs to destroy it, certainly if you want to survive the
encounter.

Right, and that's why you need if not a big brain, then at least a big *head*
(so that no-one will step on it, or more realistically so that it isn't disassembled
by a couple of stray nanites, vaporized by a laser beam etc.)

Agreed. Since the future is an unknown quantity, one can currently only
speculate as to which technologies will provide the desired human capabilities
for the best life for all. Subsequently, all potential beneficial methodologies
should be explored. The ability to take the base materials from a group of any
type of atom, and rearrange the same to form any other type of atoms is
something that should be pursued.

You can't push atoms around, unless they are noble gases absorbed to a 
cold surface. If you had a naked atom (radical) trying to bond it to 
something would be the least of your worries. In fact this is the
reason you can't work with single atoms (with the possible exclusion 
of shooting cold radicals down a buckytube upon a surface), but have 
to use reactive moieties. They are either an analogon of a monomer, 
or get reactivated in a cycle after deposition. The abstract deposited 
species may indeed be an atom, but this doesn't mean you are pushing 
atoms around.

But how much? Antigravity would be very beneficial, but there are
obviously a lot of very hard work needed to be done to get it
practical - if it is possible at all, which we do not know. How much
should we pursue it compared to (say) cryonics or a better search
engine?

In the end, it is a question of how much we chose to invest in what -
put everything on a safe bet, distribute it among likely candidate
technologies, take a chance and invest in far-off stuff? The most
extropian solution would of course be a self-organized, flexible
method that encourages rational estimates; idea futures is one such
idea (just read the online excerpts of EarthWeb, some nice portrayal
there of how it might work), plain investment another. Some people
believe strongly in certain technologies and would invest in them,
others play it safe.

The total of all Human actions determines whether the world is like a heaven on
earth, or a living hell. Everyone makes a vote as to the type of world we have

You sure transfer text via SSL, but what happens with your mail on the

I'm not being silly; this utopian fantasy is itself just as silly as the
Christian utopian fantasy, and I see no reason why enslaved SIs would
willingly support humans who just sit on their ass all day watching TV.
The more work you move from humans to machines, the smarter the machines
become relative to the humans, until eventually the humans are simply
obsolete.

Fairly, provided we can get out of the current phase of rampant busybodyism
without catastrophic results.

Things cannot turn out very well for everyone, because people have different
desires which contradict each other; often when one person wins another 
loses. Personally I find most of the recent utopias suggested on the list
hideous.

>Or perhaps you simply disagree with the means they propose for

I'm not interested in optimism, I'm interested in rational optimism; in
fact I'd say that irrational optimism ('let's just ban [insert whatever
the peril of the day is today] and everything will be wonderful') is one
of the greatest problems we have today. Again, the recent utopias are
irrational and try to skim over their fundamental problems in their rush
to be optimistic.

Thanks. My belief is that since everyone desires a good life, we should make the
same a common goal, and devote some more resources toward finding the knowledge
to make it a reality for all.

There could be other solutions such as development of manmade materials that

True. But if all mental and physical desires are fulfilled who would be in the
market to purchase the same, and what incremental value would one charge if they
have all mental and physical desires fulfilled?

True. But won't future abilities allow for the replication of the same?

The achievement of a higher level of increased conscious-being may eliminate
such behavioral pathologies. If not, people so disposed will have to find
alternative remedies such as playing dictator in virtual reality.

The universe is infinite and therefore has enough room to handle a Jupiter-sized
brain for everyone if so desired. Once we figure out how the human brain works,
see http://www-hbp.scripps.edu/home.html  and how to achieve full mental
satisfaction, we will better understand what effect such full mental
satisfaction will have on current paradigms such as material desire, and
therefore know which technologies to give priority toward in order to satisfy
the same. Of course if we find the ability to reach a place beyond Utopia
(Entopia), where humans exist in a state of pure energy, then all these material
world issues become academic.

Jon

And what of those whose idea of a 'good life' does not involve spending

Humanity *is* limited to this solar system for decades to come; and even
if we do leave it we won't be able to acquire resources fast enough in
other solar systems to allow everyone to have everything they could desire.

"If no-one wanted anything, who would want anything?" Duh.

You think the Israelis and Arabs will be happy to each have a duplicate

Many of the tasks you want to eliminate will require human-level sentience.
What exactly is the benefit of enslaving a human-level sentience made of
silicon so that a human-level sentience made of goop doesn't have to do
the work?

And if they refuse to do it in VR and choose to become a dictator for
real?

 Efficiency of funds spent on R&D could be increased through a global research
consortium that monitors all such activity to help coordinate and guide all R&D
efforts. Such a system could eliminate wasteful duplication of effort, and
provide a mechanism for sharing of available research knowledge with and between
the
different R&D undertakings. The consortium could fund a committee of experts to
track promising technologies and provide guidance in spending allocations.

Silver has been touted as having the highest electrical and thermal
conductivity of any metal, though it is only 5.8% more electrically
conductive than copper, copper being 33.5% more electrically conductive
than gold, at room temperature, so the differences are not dramatic.


Silver, gold and a number of other metals are commonly used as electrical
contact faces, both for switch contacts and connector contacts.  Gold may
be preferred where currents are low enough that the contact face does not
have to be large, or where the voltage levels are extremely low and
unlikely to be able to punch through corrosion when the contacts touch.  



Mercury-wetted contacts are probably the best for carrying extremely low
level signals; they also have the property that they make and break
cleanly (no intermittency from contact bounce) due to the surface tension
of the mercury.  For health reasons, mercury contacts have to be
encapsulated, which drives up cost, so they are seldom used.


Silver, when used for electrical contacts, has the fortuitous property
that silver tarnish (aka silver sulfide, aka argentite, aka Ag2S) is
sufficiently conductive (resistivity = 1.5 to 2.0 x 10E-3 ohm-m) that a
thin layer of tarnish is not a problem in most applications.


Oddly enough, the price of gold is 50 times that of silver, whereas the
stockpile quantities of the two metals are about equal, at least within a
factor of two or three.

 I was watching "Sci-Tech" on the Discovery channel this weekend and saw
something cool. They have developed a new medication for people with
narcolepsy (sp) that allows them to stay awake for 12 hours per dose. The
Army ran some tests on it and found that troops given the drug can stay
alert up to 72 hours without sleep!
 A group of solders were given repetitive tasks to do on a computer during
the study to test their mental alertness, and it was shown that although
they began to feel physically tired after about 24-30 hours, their
decision making ability did not start to degrade until the third day
without sleep.
 Some researchers are concerned that long term exposer to the drug will
interfere with normal sleep cycles, but so far no adverse side effects have
been found.
 
 Pretty cool, eh?

I really haven't looked into the details of their scheme at
all, but from what I understand it is based on a Java client
that basically operates in a similiar fashion to a PGP client...
I don't think unencrypted messages are stored anywhere. It
is encrypted by one client, sent to their servers (in Vancouver
I believe), and just held there in their encrypted form until
the recipient views it on their client. The only service they
are providing besides the client software is a web-based email
system like any other. But I could be totally wrong. There was
a thread on this on Slashdot a few days ago with plenty of
comments if you want to read that.

I am curious why you think it is hideous that I desire to share the value

I happen to realize that my future and the futures of everyone on the

persuade others to help people succeed, those helped may go on to
generate ideas and technologies that I will benefit from.  As an
individual, my most effecient and powerful means of getting what I want
in the world is to share my valuable ideas with others who have similar
goals and who will use my ideas to further our mutual goals.

I don't see why you find my generosity "hideous".  Unless you have
already determined that none of my ideas are of value to you, it seems
like it would be in your own best interest to encourage me to share my
ideas freely, as I have planned, rather than trying to intimidate me with
your insults.

If I gave you an idea that you could market and make millions of dollars,
would you still consider my promotion of generosity "hideous"?  Why are
you so against me simply sharing what I have and encouraging others to do
the same?

We can do better than that.  How about sonar-based vision?  Distribute a
network of sensors through your clothing (or skin, with better tech), and
you can easily collect enough data for that.  You don't even need an
emitter - you can use background noise as 'illumination', if you have enough
computer power.

Map the results onto your visual field, and you gain the ability to see
through solid matter.  You could use color coding to indicate physical
properties of what you are looking at (density & rigidity are pretty easy to
measure this way).

How about a general visualization enhancement?  Set it up so that when you
picture something in your mind the data is interpreted by a computer, which
stores it in memory and echoes it back to you.  As you imagine more details
the computer adds them to the existing model, and when you shift your mental
viewpoint it echoes back the appropriate data.  If you can get the feedback
to work right this could vastly improve your ability to visualize complex
objects - a very useful ability for engineers, artists and VR designers.

High-speed evolution in a test tube: Biotechnology's new wave
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
AP Medical Writer

SEATTLE (AP) - Biotechnology companies are causing a revolution in 
evolution: conducting high-speed evolution inside test tubes to improve 
micro-organisms in ways Mother Nature never would, and thus create a range 
of super-products.

Called "directed evolution," proponents say the process could prove one of 
the most important steps in biotechnology since genetic engineering.

The idea is to discover in nature substances that perform in a certain way 
but have drawbacks, like a cancer-fighting protein that can only be used in 
small doses because of side effects, and force them to rapidly evolve to be 
better - everything from super laundry detergents to novel drugs.

"It's optimizing the best nature can provide," explained Jay Short, 
president of Diversa Inc., which is trying to improve blood transfusions 
with the process.

The first commercial product derived from directed evolution is an enzyme 
that fights tough laundry stains better than a previous detergent 
ingredient.

But at a meeting of 5,000 biotechnologists this week, companies outlined 
numerous others under study - from anticancer drugs and better vaccines to a 
fade-resistant laundry enzyme that promises to let people wash a red shirt 
together with underwear and socks without the socks turning pink.

In biotechnology, "the process until now has been: Here are genes from 
nature, and what can I do to squash these into a workable commercial 
product?" said Russell Howard, president of Maxygen Inc., a leader in the 
field.

But redesigning genes or the proteins they produce to fit a specific need is 
very difficult and expensive, because scientists simply don't understand 
enough about how these complex substances work, said directed evolution 
pioneer Frances Arnold of the California Institute of Technology.

Nature pressures species to adapt, forcing diversification and survival of 
the fittest.

With directed evolution, biotechnologists use various laboratory methods to 
pressure genes to mutate in thousands of ways, doing in days or weeks what 
can take nature years. It took decades for certain bacteria to evolve to 
resist antibiotics, for instance, but companies can in days create new 
super-germs to test new antibiotics.

Sometimes they cause mutations nature never would - creating enzymes that 
can withstand mixing with strong chemicals or boiling temperatures, for 
example.

Then, in a high-tech twist on how farmers breed better animals and plants, 
scientists can pick the most promising newly evolved genes and combine them 
into even better "daughter genes" that produce new drugs or biochemicals.

"We're breeding at the molecular level," explained Arnold.

"If you don't use this technology, then you're at the whim of trying to find 
an enzyme in nature that does what you want," added Glenn Nedwin, president 
of Novo Nordisk Biotech, maker of that evolved detergent ingredient.

In the pipeline:

-Diversa is evolving enzymes to strip certain molecules from blood, thus 
converting Type A and Type B blood donations into the Type O blood that 
almost everyone can use.

-A recent Maxygen experiment suggests it could improve by a stunning 
200,000-fold the potency of alpha interferon, an important cancer and 
anti-viral drug that has dose-limiting toxicity. Now it is searching for 
drug companies to work with in improving such drugs.

-Maxygen recently received $20 million in government funding for directed 
evolution, mostly to create better vaccines for the military.

-Moving faster are biochemicals. Novo Nordisk has evolved an enzyme found in 
mushrooms to deactivate dyes released in water, meaning it could prevent a 
red shirt from staining white laundry.

-Arnold evolved an enzyme to help synthesize antibiotics more cheaply and 
with less pollution.

-Diversa is finalizing an enzyme to make chicken feed manufacturing cheaper 
and less polluting, because makers would no longer have to add phosphate.

-University of Illinois scientists just reported a way to evolve certain 
immune system cells to better fight autoimmune diseases, even AIDS. Also 
under study are anti-cancer drugs and enzymes to strengthen chemotherapy.

Though I agree with little he writes, David always provokes more
thought than anger in me, so I find his input valuable.  Unlike many
of the other left-leaning list dwellers here, he often has unique
insights (though nonetheless wrong:) and is not just a brainwashed
mouthpiece for someone else's agenda or cultural pejudice.  And even
when he is deliberately provocative, he is eloquently so and with
purpose.  Killfiling him reveals more about the listener's mental
fragility than David's value in the discussion.

Killfilling, despite the word, has little to do with anger.

Can you provide an example of such an unique insight?

He's eloquent, yes. Provocative, no. Boring, very much yes.

 > fragility than David's value in the discussion.

Time/attention is one of the scarcest resources we have. Mental
fragility has little to do with tolerancy to redundant egocentrical 
rants.

In the Sci-Fi novel _Xenocide_, by Orson Scott Card, one of the characters
suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder. In the book, the citizens
consider actions related to this disorder "the will of the gods." This
book is the third book of a quartet, and I'm not sure you want to read
_Ender's Game_ and _Speaker of the Dead_ in order to understand some stuff
in this book (although they are both excellent books).

Not quite. You can always get cashiered from the military, and if you are bad enough, expelled from government schools. The only ways to get kicked out of a prison are to either do your time, or be even worse to get sent to a worse prison.

Hehehehe... I hope you are aware that you have given half of the
oldtimers a heart attack. Fancy hearing that view on this list :-)

Seriously, this proposal is seriously flawed by its centralism: beside
the obvious problem of corruption and waste (which increases at least
proportionally to the amount of money/resources a central bureaucracy
handles) the consortium would also have little incentive to be good at
what it is doing; if research doesn't progress as fast as it could,
the consortium would just shrug and say that it needs more
resources. The problem of generally predicting which areas will become
useful is likely impossible to solve in practice and in principle, the
centralized structure will limit the information flow to the expert
comittees. 

This is not just a matter of opinion or organisational theory,
experience seems to have borne out that centrally planned research
initiatives have been less efficient than free research (the obvious
example is Soviet research, although the EU framework programs are
looking more and more worrying too).

It is better to have groups that independently select what to study
and invest in, based on their knowledge (which they have a strong
incentive to do the most with, since it is their money). Collaboration
and avoiding duplication can be achieved in a decentralized fashion
such as the current scientific networking or net databases of "who's
doing what".

Thanks Craig. To pre-empt anyone who might compare my aphorism to the boys in Littleton as boys who waded through a lot of shit and didn't seem to have much character:

People are like iron. Tempered in the furnace and hammered on the anvil of life's experience, one either becomes like steel or shatters. Today's society only seems to care about turning out 'pig iron' for people, wishing to protect us from rather than prepare us for the tempering process which so many try to deny exists.

But if you get expelled from government schools for being bad enough,
isn't there a strong probability that you'll eventually end up in prison
anyway?

be knocked down, survival of the fittest, stand up straight, shoulders

head up, listen to me when I'm talking to you soldier!

Actually, If you're going to be hammered on an anvil, wouldn't iron

I have re-read everything I have written on this list for the past month,
and I honestly don't understand why so many of you are so upset by what I
have written.  I noticed two or three things I wrote that were meant to
be mildly offensive, but that was in response to what I viewed as extreme
and unfounded hostility towards me.  I would appreciate it if those who
have been offended by me would read over what I have written and let me
know what I did to upset them so much.  I have no wish to be offensive,
and I am quite surprised by the reaction I am getting from many of you.  

I feel that I have been unjustly accused by many on this list, and I
would appreciate a detailed explanation, based on what I have posted to
the list, of why so many are so upset at me.  I honestly don't know what
I am writing that has offended so many.  

Thank you for your feedback,

David_Musick@juno.com

Title
  Age-associated decline in ascorbic acid concentration,
  recycling, and biosynthesis in rat hepatocytes--reversal with
  (R)-alpha-lipoic acid supplementation.
Source
  FASEB Journal.  12(12):1183-9, 1998 Sep.
Abstract
  Ascorbic acid recycling from dehydroascorbic
  acid and biosynthesis from gulono-1,4-lactone were used as
  measures of cellular response capacity to increased oxidative stress induced
  by tert-butylhydroperoxide. The hepatic ascorbic acid
  concentration was 54% lower in cells from old rats when compared to cells
  isolated from young rats (P<0.0005). Freshly isolated hepatocytes from old
  rats exhibited a significantly decreased ascorbic acid
  recycling capacity in response to oxidative stress (P<0.005) compared to
  cells from young rats. Ascorbic acid synthesis in these
  cells from old animals was unaffected by various concentrations of
  tert-butylhydroperoxide, but amounted to only approximately half of the
  biosynthetic rate when compared to cells from young animals (P<0.001). Cells
  from young animals were not significantly affected by the
  tert-butylhydroperoxide treatments. The results demonstrate a declining
  ability with age to respond to increased oxidative stress. (R)-alpha-Lipoic
  acid, a mitochondrial coenzyme, is a powerful antioxidant. A
  two-week dietary supplementation of old animals with 0.5% (R)-alpha-lipoic
  acid prior to cell isolation almost completely reversed the
  age-associated effects on ascorbic acid concentration
  (P<0.0001), recycling (P<0.05) and biosynthesis after oxidative stress. These
  results provide further evidence for the potential of alpha-lipoic
  acid in treatment of diseases related to oxidative stress.
  Furthermore, the study extends the value of ascorbic acid as
  a biomarker of oxidative stress.

Utility Fog: The Stuff that Dreams are Made Of


Nanotechnology is based on the concept of tiny, self-replicating robots. The 
Utility Fog is a very simple extension of the idea: Suppose, instead of 
building the object you want atom by atom, the tiny robots linked their arms 
together to form a solid mass in the shape of the object you wanted? Then, 
when you got tired of that avant-garde coffeetable, the robots could simply 
shift around a little and you'd have an elegant Queen Anne piece instead.

The color and reflectivity of an object are results of its properties as an 
antenna in the micron wavelength region. Each robot could have an "antenna 
arm" that it could manipulate to vary those properties, and thus the surface 
of a Utility Fog object could look just about however you wanted it to. A 
"thin film" of robots could act as a video screen, varying their optical 
properties in real time.

Rather than paint the walls, coat them with Utility Fog and they can be a 
different color every day, or act as a floor-to-ceiling TV. Indeed, make the 
entire wall of the Fog and you can change the floor plan of your house to 
suit the occasion. Make the floor of it and never gets dirty, looks like 
hardwood but feels like foam rubber, and extrudes furniture in any form you 
desire. Indeed, your whole domestic environment can be constructed from 
Utility Fog; it can form any object you want (except food) and whenever you 
don't want an object any more, the robots that formed it spread out and form 
part of the floor again.

You may as well make your car of Utility Fog, too; then you can have a "new" 
one every day. But better than that, the *interior* of the car is filled 
with robots as well as its shell. You'll need to wear holographic 
"eyephones" to see, but the Fog will hold them up in front of your eyes and 
they'll feel and look as if they weren't there. Although heavier than air, 
the Fog is programmed to simulate its physical properties, so you can't feel 
it: when you move your arm, it flows out of the way. Except when there's a 
crash! Then it forms an instant form-fitting "seatbelt" protecting every 
inch of your body. You can take a 100-mph impact without messing your hair.

But you'll never have a 100-mph impact, or any other kind. Remember that 
each of these robots contains a fair-sized computer. They already have to be 
able to talk to each other and coordinate actions in a quite sophisticated 
way (even the original nano-assemblers have to, to build any macroscopic 
object). You can simply cover the road with a thick layer of robots. Then 
your car "calls ahead" and makes a reservation for every position in time 
and space it will occupy during the trip.

As long as you're covering the roads with Fog you may as well make it thick 
enough to hold the cars up so they can cross intersections at different 
levels. But now your car is no longer a specific set of robots, but a 
*pattern* in the road robots that moves along like a wave, just as a picture 
of a car moves across the pixels of a video screen. The appearance of the 
car at this point is completely arbitrary, and could even be dispensed 
with--all the road Fog is transparent, and you appear to fly along 
unsupported.

If you filled your house in with Fog this way, furniture no longer need be 
extruded from the floor; it can appear instantly as a pattern formed out of 
the "air" robots. Non-Fog objects can float around at will the way you did 
in your "car". But what's more, your surroundings can take on the 
appearance, and feel, of any other environment they can communicate with. 
Say you want to visit a friend; you both set your houses to an identical 
pattern. Then a Fog replica of him appears in your house, and one of you 
appears in his. The "air" fog around you can measure your actions so your 
simulacrum copies them exactly.

The pattern you both set your houses to could be anything, including a 
computer-generated illusion. In this way, Utility Fog can act as a 
transparent interface between "cyberspace" and physical reality.




Tech Specs
Active, polymorphic material ("Utility Fog") can be designed as a 
conglomeration of 100-micron robotic cells ("foglets"). Such robots could be 
built withthe techniques of molecular nanotechnology (see Drexler, 
"Nanosystems", Wiley, 1992). Using designs from that source, controllers 
with processing capabilities of 1000 MIPS per cubic micron, and electric 
motors with power densities of one milliwatt per cubic micron are assumed.

Each Foglet has twelve arms, arranged as the faces of a dodecahedron. The 
central body of the foglet is roughly spherical, 10 microns in diameter. The 
arms are 5 microns in diameter and 50 microns long. A convex hull of the 
foglet approximates a 100-micron sphere. Each Foglet will weigh about 20 
micrograms and contain about 5 quadrillion atoms. Its mechanical motions 
will have a precision of about a micron.

The arms telescope rather than having joints. The arms swivel on a universal 
joint at the base, and the gripper at the end can rotate about the arm's 
axis. The gripper is a hexagonal structure with three fingers, mounted on 
alternating faces of the hexagon. Two Foglets "grasp hands" in an 
interleaved six-finger grip. Since the fingers are designed to match the end 
of the other arm, this provides a relatively rigid connection; forces are 
only transmitted axially through the grip. When at rest, foglets form a 
lattice whose structure is that of a face-centered cubic crystal (i.e. an 
octet truss).

For a mass of Utility Fog to flow from one shape to another, or to exert 
dynamic forces (as in manipulating objects), a laminar flow field for the 
deformation is calculated. The foglets in each lamina remain attached to 
each other, but "walk" hand over hand across the adjacent layers. Although 
each layer can only move at a speed differential of 5 m/s with its neighbor, 
the cumulative shear rate in a reasonable thickness of Fog is considerable, 
up to 500 m/s per centimeter of thickness.

The atomically-precise crystals of the foglets' structural members will have 
a tensile strength of at least 100,000 psi. As an open lattice, the foglets 
occupy only about 3% of the volume they encompass. When locked in place, the 
Fog has a more or less anisotropic tensile strength of 1000 psi. In motion, 
this is reduced to about 500 if measured perpendicular to the shear plane. 
As a bulk material it has a density of 0.2 g/cc.

Without altering the lattice connectivity, Fog can contract by up to about 
40% in any linear dimension, reducing its overall volume by a factor of 
five. (This is done by retracting all arms simultaneously.) Selective 
application of this technique allows Fog to simulate shapes and flow fields 
to a precision considerably greater than 100 microns.

An appropriate mass of Utility Fog can be programmed to simulate most of the 
physical properties of any macroscopic object (including air and water), to 
roughly the same precision those properties are measured by human senses. 
The major exceptions are taste, smell, and transparency. The latter an be 
overcome with holographic "eyephones" if a person is to be completely 
embedded in Fog.

Consider the application of Utility Fog to a task such as telepresence. The 
worksite is enclosed in a cloud of Fog, which simulates the hands of the 
operators to assemble the parts and manipulate tools. The operator is 
likewise completely embedded in Fog. Here, the Fog simulates the objects 
that are at the worksite, and allows the operator to manipulate them.

The Fog can also support the operator in such a way as to simulate 
weightlessness, if desired. Alternatively, the Fog at the worksite could 
simulate the effect of gravity on the objects there (in any desired 
direction).

 I was watching "Sci-Tech" on the Discovery channel this weekend and saw
something cool. They have developed a new medication for people with
narcolepsy (sp) that allows them to stay awake for 12 hours per dose. The
Army ran some tests on it and found that troops given the drug can stay
alert up to 72 hours without sleep!
 A group of solders were given repetitive tasks to do on a computer during
the study to test their mental alertness, and it was shown that although
they began to feel physically tired after about 24-30 hours, their
decision making ability did not start to degrade until the third day
without sleep.
 Some researchers are concerned that long term exposer to the drug will
interfere with normal sleep cycles, but so far no adverse side effects have
been found.

 Pretty cool, eh?

Excellent ideas! How about linking yourself up to "spy" satelites, so
that you can "see" anywhere that you think about (above ground). Our
vision is interpreted into a 3d model (2D+, but hey), by our brains
infering missing information from other knowledge. Why not enhance that
ability, filling in with information from satelites: the 3D image you
infer from looking at an object might be a lot more realistic, if your
inferences come from real, live data which can see the "back" of the
object at the same time that you are looking at the "front". You
wouldn't "see" in any more detail, you'd just have a better feeling for
depth.

How about a bit of group mind stuff (warning, warning) to enhance this
further: Say that you can build a GIS that contains the sum of human
knowledge of what the world looks like at any time. Then, if you are
connected to such a database, your vision could be filled in with data
from such a system. You might want to look through walls or not,
depending on how you feel at any time (your vision still needs to map to
the 2 and a bit D model that your mind can handle). But you could
visualise any spot on the globe, and actually "see" it. What's on the
other side of the mountain? I'll just visualise it as if I was on the
other side... right, its the other side of the mountain. Oh. 

Where would this info come from? Everyone who was hooked up could also
be recording into the GIS whenever they looked at anything (although you
would need to be able to turn this recording off whenever you wished
to). You might even be paid something for your efforts (incentive to
record). Other sources: surveillance cameras, satelites, anything that
records vision could add to this visual database.

Professional explorers could race to be the first to record remote
places (paid for their efforts). They might get royalties for a period
over areas that they alone had recorded.

If you could record changes over time, you'd be able to watch events;
imagine it was last week, and you're at the meeting you missed - see it
as if it is happening in front of you.

Did you see the stuff about Steve Mann posted earlier? An excerpt from 
"Cyborg Seeks Community" posted by Gina Miller:

Every morning I decide how I will see the world that day. Sometimes I
give 
myself eyes in the back of my head. Other days I add a sixth sense, such
as 
the ability to feel objects at a distance. If I'm going to ride my
bicycle, 
I'll want to feel the cars and trucks pressing against my back, even
when 
they are a few hundred feet away.

...

While at McMaster, I added biosensors to the WearComp so that it could 
monitor my heart rate (as well as the full EKG waveform) and other 
physiological signals. I also invented the "vibravest"-a garment studded
with radar transceivers and vibrating elements. Wearing this vest made 
objects at a distance feel as if they were pressing against my body. I
could 
close my eyes and walk down the hallway, confident that any wall or
other 
obstacle would be felt as warning vibrations on the appropriate side of
the 
vest. By sparing myself from the cognitive load of processing all that 
visual information, I found I was able to think more clearly.

(I am assuming that this stuff is real - it blows my mind)

Might work for landscapes and general geography, but wouldn't be
directly personally useful. I would instead go for having a number of
drone robots (gnatbots) around me, filling in details of the
surroundings. Works better indoors.

Sounds like a good idea. Maybe you could have markers for uncertain or
dated images (like when playing a computer strategy game like
Civilization).

Of course, all this assumes that we can interface with the 3D model in
our brains, which is nontrivial. A near-term solution would be having
wearables allowing something similar - no direct 3D experience, but
possible to view the model.

I wouldn't worry too much.  Just keep on being yourself.  I found your post
refreshing.  I found the writing honest and direct.  It is not too hard to
tick off someone especially when you are so direct.

Its hard to develop a firm opinion based on the contents of their web site.
On the one hand, photonics as a very promising field that is currently
making rapid strides.  Their optical telecommunications work seems about in
line with what I would expect from a cutting-edge research facility in that
field.

OTOH, their claims about optical chips with features "1000 times smaller
than today's electron-based semi-conductor chips" radiate a pretty fierce
bogon flux.  Current state of the art is just beginning to make photonic ICs
possible at all - the idea that someone has leaped all the way from discrete
macroscopic components to 0.0005-micron features in one mighty bound seems
terribly unlikely.

I also note that they seem very leery about giving any technical details
about their work.  Their press releases give no concrete data at all about
the performance of their equipment or the technologies they use, which is
very unusual for this sort of operation.  This could be the result of
paranoid information security policies, but it could also be an indication
that the whole thing is some kind of fraud. It is interesting to note that
the company is apparently owned by some kind of shell company, which has
recently been involved in lawsuits with some of its shareholders.

Bottom line - until they actually start selling something, I'd be very
careful about taking their word for anything.  I certainly wouldn't invest
in the company - there are too many opportunities out there that don't
display so many warning signs.

Like all transhumanists, I want greater abilities than I have now.  I
read about, anticipate and even design technologies which will extend my
abilities in the future.  However, I also realize that the abilities I
already have are not being utilized to anywhere near their potential. 
And while I realize that adding technological layers to myself will
extend my abilities in the future, I also realize that I can extend my
abilities now through practice and discipline.  

For example, I can learn to develop faster and more accurate motor skills
as well as greater strength with various kinds of exercise (more on this
later).  I can learn to be far more efficient in my everyday actions.  I
can learn to see visual images in greater detail and analyze more fully
my constantly changing visual field so that my internal model of my
surroundings is more accurate.  I can learn to improve my ability to
visualize complex three-dimensional models, which comes in handy for
engineering and mathematics activities.  

Everything I can do, I can learn to do better, and because I am learning
to take more full advantage of my current biological abilities, when
technological augmentations become available to me, I will be able to
take more full advantage of these abilities because I practice the
discipline of taking advantage of whatever situation I find myself in.  

>From what others have demonstrated throughout human history, the
potential of even non-augmented human beings is incredible, far beyond
what ordinary people achieve.  It is unnecessarily wasteful to focus on
only technological means of extending our abilities when there is so much
we could do through our own self-discipline.

One of the advantages of extending your innate abilities is that you can
start right now and you don't have to wait for some company to make a
product to sell you that may or may not work reliably.

I would agree with the above statement. Yet a global research consortium that
monitors all such activity to help coordinate and guide all R&D efforts would
still be beneficial if structured correctly. It could be structured as a think
tank of experts in R&D who could offer input as to where public research funds
would be most beneficially spent, which advise should exceed the abilities of
politicians. Additionally, this think tank could facilitate the creation of a
comprehensive online clearinghouse of all public research information. The
Global Inventory Project at  http://www.gip.int/en/noframes.htm  seeks to
fulfill a similar type of clearinghouse role, but limited to Information Society
information only.

The profit motive as facilitated by the patent system promotes private research
efforts. It would be interesting if someone could devise a way to increase such
efforts. As to public funding I would agree that the more independent groups
that can be financed, the more likely we are to increase the knowledge base of
humanity.

Being blessed/cursed with mental illness myself (bipolar disorder),
sanity doesn't come as automatically for me as it seems to come for
others.  Having worked for years on becoming more sane, I have had to
take advantage of many forms of mental discipline to remain sane in
spite
of pretty much always feeling like I am on some sort of psychedelic
drug.

Learning how to focus deeply on the reality of the current moment has
been of immense help to me in my efforts to develop greater sanity. 
Engaging in lots of problem solving activities has also helped me
develop
a feeling of confidence that none of my problems are insurmountable (so
that I don't give up on my own sanity).  Engaging in lots of
communication with others has helped me refine my thinking and has
helped
me utilize the solutions that others have discovered to their own,
similar problems.  I try everything that I think will work, and I work
to
improve all methods I try.

The differences are large enough, as I found out while researching
soundcards.  Gold is a better conductor than copper, and doesn't corrode
nearly as quickly as silver, but costs more and jumps up the price on
hardware (like the AWE64 Gold).  Silver is the best conductor, but it
corrodes WAY too quickly.  Copper is the favorite, as it's fairly cheap and
a reliable conductor.

The patent system has been a good way to ensure that inventors are
rewarded for their efforts, and it has provided incentive for people to
invest time and money on the research necessary to create new inventions.
 However, the patent system was created before the Internet, and the
Internet allows for more effective ways of rewarding creative people and
thus promoting greater creativity.

I would like to see the development of a system where creative
individuals can sell their ideas through the Internet.  Those looking for
ideas to buy could read brief descriptions of the idea and could then pay
to access more details.  Those selling ideas would decide how much they
want to sell the details of their idea for and how they want the price to
change over time.  Of course, anyone would still be able to get a patent
on their ideas; I'm just thinking about a system for actually marketing
and making money on ideas.

Lets say I came up with an invention that I know several competing
companies would be interested in.  These companies could be notified of
the idea and also of the fact that their competitors are being offered
the chance to buy the idea also.  I could sell my idea to all companies
interested, or I could allow them to bid against each other, and I could
sell my idea to the highest bidder, with the agreement that I will not
disclose the idea to others for a certain period of time.  I see many
different possibilities for making money off ideas.

The full details of such a system have yet to be worked out by me, but I
anticipate the development of companies which market ideas for creative
people.  Anyone could contribute ideas, and as the company sold the
ideas, they would make money for themselves and their clients.  It seems
like this would be an effective way to promote creativity among humans.

I would appreciate any comments you have on this idea.

the creative potential of humans is greatly undervalued

I think this is to complex an issue to be summed up in any broad
generalization.  The emotional impact of any given enhancement is going to
depend on the intimate details of how it is implemented, and on the
personality and social context of the recipient.  If we want to predict the
effect of any given enhancement, we need to think about exactly what it is
going to feel like to use it.

Existing sensory enhancements are merely external tools, which give
relatively modest abilities and require conscious consideration to use.  As
a result we rarely take the trouble to use them, and we are not much
affected by their existence.  Futuristic devices that are used the same way
will likewise have little lasting emotional impact on their users.

The first threshold of personal impact is crossed when an enhancement
becomes ubiquitous.  If a sensory enhancement is convenient and useful
enough to be used constantly, the user will eventually begin to think of it
as part of himself.  If something happens to make the enhancement stop
working, the user feels as if part of himself has been lost.  People who
have used glasses, hearing aids, or (more recently) wearable computers
sometimes exhibit this reaction.

Moving well past this threshold, I believe we will find that there is a
point at which ubiquitous enhancements actually change the recipient's
conception of himself.  This could happen because of the practical
implications of the enhancement (i.e. "I can see at night as well as in
daylight, so why would I be afraid of the dark?"), or because of the direct
emotional effects of its use (consider the psychological implications of
advanced hedonic engineering, for instance).  A person with enhancements at
this level still has a relatively human psyche, but their personality will
be noticeably affected by the enhancements that they have adopted.

Moving further into the future, moderately advanced nanotech would enable
the creation of new senses that probably could not be successfully
interfaced with a normal human mind.  When you start talking about adding
multiple new high-bandwidth senses, new modes of communication, and internal
enhancements (like improved visualization, or the ability to follow multiple
simultaneous conversations) you're going to have a significant effect on the
psyche that receives all this augmentation.  However, once again the nature
of the effect is going to depend on exactly which enhancements you select,
how they are used, and how the recipient feels about them.

That looks like its going to be a very knotty question.  Obviously the easy
way to go with sensory augmentation is to simply layer the new data over an
existing channel.  For simple enhancements like low-light vision, and for VR
and enhanced-reality environments, this approach should be sufficient.  For
anything more ambitious than that it will quickly reach the point where the
channel is saturated - you may be able to use normal, low-light, IR or
telescopic vision, but you won't be able to use them all at once.

Now, to some extent you can work around this problem with clever
engineering.  You can have a computer analyze a sensory channel for you, and
only show you the details you might be interested in.  You can map data from
one sense to another (like Steve Mann's vibravest), and you can set up all
kinds of fancy filters and co-processing schemes.  Ultimately, however, such
approaches are inferior to a truly integrated system, because they force you
to rely on an external tool to decide what you do and don't want to
perceive.

Breaking that barrier will be a very complex job.  The simplest case would
be something like increasing your range of hearing.  To do that you
essentially have to remove all of the brain mechanisms that handle sound
processing, and replace them with an upgraded version that can handle a
wider range of frequencies and a larger volume of data.  That's a big job,
but at least its confined to a single system.

The next step would be something like parabolic hearing (the ability to
amplify sound from one direction but not others, so that you can listen to
distant sounds as if they were nearby).  To make this work like a truly
inborn ability, you have to be able to aim your hearing the same way you
move your eyes - so we'd have to be able to create new motor abilities, and
all of the "wiring" necessary to make them accessible to the user's
conscious mind.

For more advanced enhancements, even more radical changes will be needed.
For example, if you are going to create a new sense (sonar vision, say, or
radio-frequency perception) you really want to create the whole symphony of
components needed to perceive, visualize, remember and create with the new
sense.  Doing this even once is likely to have a significant effect on a
person (imagine how different life would be without speech, hearing, or
anything connected with them).  Doing it several times, for several new
senses, is going to be a revolutionary change in the recipient's subjective
experience of life.

I agree.  I think Anders was on to something with his "picotech processors
living on a neutron star" idea.  Creating a density regime in which it is
possible for subatomic particles to form compact structures with the same
range of complexity exhibited by normal matter is probably a very delicate
process, but it seems reasonable to think that it could be done in
principle.  That being the case, we should expect than any posthuman society
would either graduate to pico-scale engineering in short order or invent
something so much better as to make it superfluous.

Me too.  Obviously a device built out of degenerate matter, in the shape of
a shell covering the surface of a white dwarf, would provide much better
performance in a far smaller volume of space (although the mass required is
larger by a factor of a few thousand).  Come on, guys, lets see some
imagination!  ;-)

Well, that's what Solar System-sized 'body' surrounding that brain is for -
a couple of solar masses worth of Dyson sphere, defense satellites and
warships will do wonders for your survivability.  Besides, you can't do much
damage to something that big with a puny little energy source like nuclear
fusion - you need a real weapon, like quantum black holes with a
carefully-timed evaporation period.

Well, that's the problem with 'small is beautiful".  I'll stick with big
guns, thick armor, and lots of empty space around me.

Of course, this is all academic anyway.  By the time it is remotely possible
to actually do anything like this, we'll have much better ideas.

A question for all of you, but especially David, since he seems to have worked
at improving his senses.

I'm curious about the "return on investment" in improving your current
mental, sensory, or physical abilities with currently available techniques.

Coming from a family legacy of poor interpersonal skills, I have made a special
effort over the last 20 years to improve mine.  It has required more attention
than time, and has paid off enormously, both in terms of my professional and
personal success.

Aerobic and weight training is another clear payoff.  Better sleep, fewer 
headaches, longer life, more energy, more strength, more stamina.

Nootropics just require money and remembering to take pills.

I haven't heard of much else that will improve my underlying abilities or quality 
of life in a way I care enough to try.  (Steve Mann's cyborg life is fascinating
but I'm not ready.)  What can people vouch for?

The best and easiest motivator for inventors is money. The greatest need for quality research beyond high quality brains is also money. Restructuring the current tax system to make it profitable for individuals and corporations to invest more in research themselves as they see fit will IMHO be the greatest benefit.

On the other side of the coin, we can look at who does the most patenting. Large corporations have a higher patent to researcher ratio than smaller corps and individuals. Why is this? Possibly because they have more resources to do high quality research, but I think that it has more to do with the fact that large corporations have large departments of trained and specialized lawyers who do nothing but patent work for the corporations.

Small groups and individuals will get more patents if the patent system is structured so that it is easier for them to research prior art and write patent applications themselves (or make it a useful tax writoff for patent lawyers to do pro bono work). It would also be nice if the fee structure were changed so that a person could finance the patent fees off of royalty earnings.

You are talking about the newest and hottest area of intellectual property: Proprietary Trade Secrets. The Trade Secrets Act of 1996 lent new power and protection for owners of unpatented and uncopyrighted Trade Secrets, however it is still a very weak area. I know that CNA Insurance is hyping its Trade Secret Insurance Policies now. I just received a floppy disk yesterday from them with pdf files about their policies. The problem is that there is no centralized repository trade secret registrations, and there is no Constitutional basis for the concept of Trade Secrets as a form of property that people had a right to have protected.

Because of this lack of Natural Law protection, any private system of centrally registering trade secrets is going to be fraught with difficulty in enforcing cooperation and compliance with any contract based system of protecting registered trade secrets. If there is no prior art basis for granting trade secret protection (i.e. nobody has thought of it yet), there could be literally thousands of identical trade secrets in the registry at the same time, so if a company is looking to buy that trade secret, who do they pay? All of them, or just the one written the best? Once they've seen your trade secret, and discard it, but they select another that has partial overlap with the first, are your rights violated? Who decides?

Ah, you want to create a patent auction house. Thats not a bad idea, maybe a website would do the trick, since IP is just information. I've got auction website development experience, anyone else want to get involved? Investors? ;)

FWIW, you haven't offended me a bit. I don't respond to your statements
because you don't respond to counterpoints. Based on that, debate is
impossible. Besides, all the points you raised are answered in complete
eloquence in both "The Fountainhead" and "Atlas Shrugged." If you haven't
read these books, I suggest you do. If you have, and you still feel the way
you do, then once again debate is pointless.

As to why you have offended so many, I can only proffer my opinion. You
espouse ideas such as negation of private property and the importance of
society over the individual. To many of us who are on this list, those
concepts are immoral and ultimately evil. It is the same thing as a Jew
getting offended at someone advocating the Holocaust. The ideas of
objectivism, enlightened self-interest, and the importance of private
ownership of poverty are the foundation upon which we live our lives and
seek to influence the future. If you seek to influence the future in other
directions, you cannot expect anything other than for us to combat you at
every turn.

A few sample quotes of yours:

>Is it absolutely essential that people
believe in the fictional concept of "property rights" in order to
interact productively and peacefully?

This is diametrically opposed to libertarian politics and objectivist
philosophy.

>I am deeply angry at those who have no respect for others

>I'm actually not intending to be offensive by the things I am posting on
the list.  I come off that way sometimes because I like to push peoples'
buttons especially if there really is no reason for them to be upset
except for their own psychological insecurities.

Intentially pushing people's buttons is not an act of respect. These two
quotes are contradictions.

>Because you are so full of hostility, you do not realize that we actually
agree on pretty much everything.

Your "I am angry" diatribe was full of hostility, yet you use that concept
to dismiss others.

>Because I am
intelligent, I would use your own deepest desires to change whatever
behaviors I wanted to.

I don't know what to say other than this statement is about as condescending
as one can get.

I don't that this feedback will help, but please don't respond unless it's a
point-by-point response that directly addresses my comments.

Is there any evidence that sufficiently stable yet complex structures
are possible in the semidegenerate matter shell around the neutronium
core? I also wonder about thermal regime. Surface temperatures might
range from MK to GK, which is damn broad even for nucleonic matter
(drextech can probably only cover 0..800 K) range.

Impressive. I just thought of a 'practical' use for this sort of computation, which I am sure has already been thought of on a test-bed basis: Cracking encrypted messages.  However, my idea would be more of an implementation and application rather than conceptual. Its obvious that military and civilian governement intelligence agencies have a need for this type of application for practical use. The idea is developing a screensaver like the seti one that instead works to crack high level encrypted messages, one key at a time. The customer would install the program on all machines in the organization, and the screensaver would interact with a cryptanalysis server somewhere on the organization WAN, exchanging double key encrypted packets of data that is made up of the encrypted information that needs to be cracked. That way, the actual user of the PC never knows what the data is that the program is trying to crack, so compartmentalized operations security is maintained, yet you take advantage of all computing capacity in the organization.

The concept would also be useful for spreading neural processing kernels across the net, to work together as a test AI.

I know that a lot of the people on the list who work with academic papers deal with distributing and/or downloading post script files from other sources, but don't like the problem with having to first print up a copy then get that copy duplicated x number of times at the copier. I just wrote a little batch file for my NT 4.0 PC that allows me to ftp a post script or PCL 'print' file (or any file for that matter) to any printer on my network that has its own IP address as many times as I specify.

Since I brought the printing of our software manuals in house to save money, I keep PS files of the manuals on hand and tell the batch file to send (x) many copies of the file to the network printer at the end of the day when I leave, so the night guy can just keep the printer fed with paper as it hums away... I set this up cause this new printer has a duplexer and I figured out that we can cut the cost of our manual production by half doing it this way rather than sending it out to the local Docutech shop. NT refuses let you drag and drop postscript files to the printers on the GUI printer driver interface, so I needed to simplify things on the command line level.

I've got a similar version for older versions of windows/dos batch language, and they both require that the user have the vedit editor installed (I'm working on a version that uses just the standard dos editor).  I'm also thinking of one that allows the user to send copies to a whole list of IP addresses, to ease distribution over the wire.

If anyone finds this useful, please let me know that you'd like a copy of the batch program and its parameter file. The file is internally documented as well as a readme file, so it should be easy to customize for your needs. Oh, yeah, and its free too...... ;)

Rudy Rucker's next book SAUCER WISDOM, a fictionalised popular science
treatment of various futurist notions he's already included in sf plus some
new ideas, projects a quark femtotechnology.  (The book will be from Forge,
a division of Tor, and will be out in July.)

Here's his (handwaving, but provocative) description of nuclear chemistry,
the basis of his *alla* - the device nanotech enthusiasts foresee one level
up as a `black box' matter compiler:

< `What's quark-flipping?  A proton is a quark-bag holding two up quarks
and one down quark, while a neutron is [blah].  ...you need to get into the
bag and flip the one quark.'

< [...] `We use a chaotic cascade to fuse all the nucleons' quark-bags into
a quark-gluon plasma that we're free to flip, shuffle, and regroup.  The
process will be directed by high-level user-request patterns made via a
custom-designed radiotelepathic [communicator] that incorporates low-level
implementation instructions for a few thousand basic substances.' >

Easy, when you know how...  :)

This is EXACTLY what nanotechnology needs, a concept that is so out there that it makes nanotech look incredibly rational and realistic. Who wants to write the 'Engines of Expansion' novel that will make Drexler look like a practical pragmatic conservative?

"The simplest case would be something like increasing your range of
hearing.  To do that you essentially have to remove all of the brain
mechanisms that handle sound processing, and replace them with an
upgraded version that can handle a
wider range of frequencies and a larger volume of data.  That's a big
job, but at least its confined to a single system."

To increase your range of hearing, you could easily shift higher
frequencies down into the audible range with a computerized hearing aid. 
The sounds could be slowed down, if desired, or listened to in slices,
with enough slices missing to that the sound is in the audible range but
also at its original speed.  One could even broadcast messages in the
higher frequencies of sound that others could hear, with the right
"hearing aids".

With vision, the frequencies outside visual range could be shifted
however one wanted and overlaid on the visual range frequencies, or a
huge chunk of the EM spectrum could be compressed to fit in the visual
range. Or any number of other options.  As long as you have the equipment
to detect the frequencies and to display visual information (and some
kind of computing device), you can do this (the programming would be
rather simple, I think).

Although (as I have pointed out before) to take full advantage of any
sensory enhancements, one must learn to process more sensory information
per second.  I have demonstrated (to myself, anyway) that one can do this
deliberately by learning to focus more intently on the present sensory
experience.  Many others throughout history have confirmed this for
themselves also.  In fact, many martial arts disciplines spend a great
deal of time on enhancing one's senses.

Buying an idea without knowing what it is is like buying 'a pig in a
poke'.  That's why patents are so widely used.  The idea is rather fully
disclosed by the patent; what is sold is a license to use the idea.

Well, I suppose neutronium is *okay*, if you're not worried about
*efficiency* or anything...but Real Powers Use Monopolium.  Not
neutronium.  Not Higgsinium.  Raw, incredibly dense monopoles.

This is the story of Mel... no, just kidding.  Anyway, my handy-dandy
reference, "Harvard Doesn't Publish Science Fiction" by Moravec in _New
Destinies III_ (it should be called _New Densities_, ha ha), says that
Higgsinium (formed of pseudo-iron atoms with a nucleus of 26 negative
Higgsinos and 26 protons orbiting the nucleus) is 10^18 times as dense
as water.  Monopolium, formed of magnetic monopoles bound by their
opposite polarities instead of electrical charges, is 10^25 times as
dense as water - a thimbleful weighs as much as the Moon.  Switching
speeds increase accordingly.

Don't tell *me* about Moore's Law running out of room.

Thus an actual Jupiter Brain, formed of Jupiter, would probably be just
around a meter wide (?).  You can't have a Brain that's actually the
size of Jupiter because it would collapse and form a black hole, not to
mention that there isn't that much mass in the whole solar system or
possibly the galaxy.

Questions for Thought and Study:

1.  What is the maximum size/mass of a JB constructed of monopolium?
2.  How much computing power would it have?
3.  How much time would a unified thought take to cross the JB?
4.  How does a JB's reaction time and flops/thought compare with a human?
5.  How does strange matter compare to Monopolium?
6.  Adjust your results for relativistic slowdown due to the JB's mass.
7.  Calculate whether monopolium has a Chandrasekhar limit.  Does this
change the maximum?
8.  How would you detect a JB using SETI?
9.  How much energy does a JB dissipate while performing computations?
10.  What is the maximum non-hole-forming density of JBs as a function
of population?
11.  At the population equalling a galactic mass, what is the time for
thoughts to cross?
12.  How does the ratio compare to human thoughts vs. human speech?
13.  What are the orbital speeds necessary to prevent a collapse to the center?
14.  How fast does a JB society circulate?
15.  How long does it take for a thought to permeate society?

According to these assumptions, far from being mutually telepathic, the
future may be filled with individuals far more alone than we ever were. 
I happen to think that Real Powers Use Alpha Points, but if anyone did
the calculations above, it would probably make a nice article somewhere.
 Alas, I lack the physics, since a mortal has to draw the line somewhere...

No, no, *no*, damn it!

"Don't just feel - think as well!  Don't just think - feel as well!  Think
*and* feel!"

(Of course we don't have a choice either way.  But we can lazily or
complacently think and/or feel poorly, thereby limiting ourselves.)

Haven't seen the new Star Wars movie (The Phantom Menace) but after
reading an article on it in Time/ Newsweek/ US News & World Report,
 I don't think I  will. There was a quote from the movie featured
prominently in a caption which I thought seemed to be a major theme in
the Star Wars mythos and in all human cultures as well, which is
perhaps why it resonates so well with the public. The quote is "Don't
think---feel!" 
  I read that and gave it some thought, and have decided that
particular sentiment/philosophy, for lack of a better word, sucks.

In fact, it is one of the things I think is wrong with humanity, this
deep reservior of mistrust for rational thought.

I say, turn it around:  Don't feel--think!

Just saw it.  When it ended, the audience didn't just clap, didn't just
cheer, some of them *screamed* their approval of the movie.  And happily
milled about the lobby and theatre, somewhat stunned.  Yes, it's just a
Star Wars movie, and just entertainment, and almost a children's story, but
that's the point.  Any movie critic putting this one down needs to find a
new line of work.  It paints a larger universe with more detail and beauty
than ever on film before.  And, there is a partial sci-fi explaination for
"the force" that makes it a bit more palatable to us hard sci-fi fans.

Oh come on - lighten up and go have some fun!  What is wrong with
feelings?  Think man, think!  How can you possibly avoid seeing a film
because of a film review and one quote?  Go see the film, its STAR WARS!

I don't think you'll need to process the data into the current spectrum.
Don't underestimate the capabilities of your brain - as you said, training
your senses helps a lot, but also, the brain changes and evolves. The more
you stress it, the better it gets. If you replace your natural eye with a
cyberware eye which has enhanced abilities like low-lite and infrared, the
brain will learn to process the new abilities. The same would be true for an
ear. Replace the ear with one of greater functionality and your brain will
learn to use them.

The human brain has already changed signifficantly since the 50s, due to
mass media and the much higher impact of information on the brain. This
resulted in a less crosslinked processing of information, but at better
speed. The main turn occurred between '72 and '75 if I remember it
correctly.

You would not be able to add totally new senses like a radar to your brain -
at least, not in the near future.

Debate is also impossible if someone merely tells you to read one of
their favourite books evry time you raise a point they disagree with.

Immoral ? Ultimately evil ?
This is a discussion forum for transhuman ideas.  I was of the belief
that it was intended for debate between open minded intelligent people,
willing to contemplate someone elses point of view without dismissing it
out of hand because it doesnt happen to agree with their particular
world view.

I was not attempting to enter into a debate with David; I was answering his
question. If you read any of my other posts in the archives, you will see
that when I wish to debate, I do. If you or David or anyone else wishes an
intelligent debate on the merits of the philosophies of individual liberty
and private property, I will happily do that. That was not the purpose of
the post you are responding to.

And I was doing just that: continuing a discussion by answering a question
as best I could. David asked what had he done to offend people, and I
offered my opinion. Like I said, I wasn't trying to debate his ideas -- he
wanted to know what he had done to offend people, not what I think the flaws
in his logic are. As for dismissing his ideas out of hand, I have heard them
many times before and have rejected them. Being open-minded doesn't mean
that you can't form a value system and reject ideas that oppose it. As for
this forum and its purpose, I don't believe anything I posted went against
that purpose. I simply pointed out that some of us have a world view which
is in direct opposition to some of the ideas he has offered, some of us
believe in absolute right and absolute wrong, and some of us will do
whatever we can to fight what we see as wrong. I would expect no less of you
or David or anyone else.

I can agree that there is an level of distrust in rational thought in
society, perhaps its because many folks don't learn how to think
rationally as children. There is a lot of pressure to just react and not
analyse.
But!
I have seen a lot of folks in rubber rooms who took "not feeling" to a
point that they lost touch with large segments of their personalities. I
won't say that not feeling is the only way into a padded cell, but it is
one of the ways.
I think that feeling supplies context to the life experience and without
that, life can't have much meaning.

That doesn't accomplish the same result.  If you take all the data from a
broad-ranged hearing sense and squash it down into the normal human range,
you will inevitably loose a lot of the information.  You won't be able to
hear the actual pitch of anything beyond the normal range, you won't be able
to listen to all those different pitches at the same time, and you won't be
able to hear patterns (like music) that occur across large frequency ranges.

As I mentioned in my post, this kind of approach is a good first step, and
its all we can do with present technology, but it falls far short of what we
ultimately want to achieve.

Same problem.  The human eye can only distinguish a few million colors.  If
you have good IR and UV sensors you're going to need several tens of
millions of new shades, and they just don't exist.  You're software will
have to discard most of that information, and what you're left with will be
some kind of "hot things glow red, UV sources glow blue" kind of color
coding scheme - which is useful, but not nearly as good as real
broad-spectrum vision.

You can learn to pay more attention to your senses, which gives the
subjective experience of receiving more input.  You can't change the actual
performance of the underlying hardware in your brain.  The best you can do
is make sure that you actually use all of the capacity you have - once
you've done that, you're stuck until we get the technology to make
improvements.

That might be OK for doing small-scale tests during the development of an
AI, but I don't think it would work very well for actually running it - the
latencies involved in Internet traffic are just too long.  It might, OTOH,
be useful for doing very large-scale decision tree searches on well-defined
problems.

The Star Wars world isn't anti-extropian, but it is not a rational
place either. It is really the land of myths but with starships. And
in myths wishing can work; rational planning doesn't fit in the
mythical framework (other than as abbreviated as "he was a wise king"
or instances of cleverness a la Odysseus) while "go with your
feelings" fit in well since myths deal very much with our feelings and
feelings of meaning. In the Star Wars world there is no real progress
or change, just history. It is a kind of dreamtime.

If you do it right, you might be able to re-train your brain to process data
from a frequency-shifted sensor (and IR camera, or an ultrasound sensor).
You might even be able to adapt to a relatively alien sense, if it is
reformatted to be similar to a sense you already have (sonar vision, for
example).  What you can't do is process this data *in addition to* your
normal sensory input.

You only have so many neurons, and each neuron can only do so much work.
Advanced sensors can easily increase the amount of raw sensory data flowing
into your brain by many, many orders of magnitude.  The only way to cope
with the increased flow of data is an equally large increase in raw
processing power, in the form of genetically engineered "super neurons",
implant computers, datalinks to external computing devices, or some other
physical modification.

You want to know greatness? You want to see creativity? You want to know
people loving, thinking, and doing with a strong philosophy?
Well, you got it! Merrill Lynch and JWT (the ad agency) have come together
to really make something wonderful. They are doing EVERYTHING right. This
is why the recent ad campaign of M. Lynch, "Technology," is by
far my favorite. I am in love with this commercial. I swear it made me
CRY! Job well done!

I am sure people think I am insane for caring so much about this, but it
matters to me. Seeing greatness, even in a commercial, is a highlight in
my life. Please please please, take the time to view  this ad, it is well
worth the watch. 

Merrill Lynch and JWT present "Technology."

(real audio is required) 

M.Lynch has two other VERY well done spots listed on their site. You can
view them if interested at:

Great commercials are my hobby. I research them and just love them to
death. Smile. If you want to know of other interesting ad campaigns or
have questions, feel free to ask. I have a ton of them and am creating a
website called "Excellence in Advertising." Enjoy!

Strictly speaking, we don't have much data either way.  It doesn't appear to
be practical to predict the behavior of matter under such conditions using
our current models, and we don't have any handy samples to experiment with.

That's why I said it would be a delicate process.  You'd have to do a lot of
number crunching to find a temperature/pressure regime in which complex
structures are stable enough to work with, and then you'd have to build a
structure that can maintain such an environment for long periods of time.

The payoff in terms of increased component density would be huge, of course,
but the scale of the engineering involved leads me to suspect its a moot
point.  By the time we could do something like that we'll be an SI
civilization, and we'll probably have much better ideas.

Those aren't just 'their favorite books' but are also on the Extropians suggested reading list, and are on the suggested reading list of most every libertarian around.

How many times does an idiot have to jump off of a building to learn that gravity makes you fall? If some idiot spews that he thinks it would be a good idea if everyone jumped off buildings, I would be mighty worried if at least a couple dozen people on a list of 300 didn't tell him he was an idiot.

Even on the most rationally open minded mail list, there comes a point where somethings are commonly accepted to be just stupid, maybe even evil, ideas. Mr. Musick does not have the luxury of being a newbie to this list. He resubscribed, even, after knowing for several years exactly what sort of people subscribe to this list. To me, his affected sense of blissful naivete and condescention is personally insulting, while his admitted glee in 'pushing other peoples' buttons I find merely rude and obnoxious. If he actually beleives many of the things he spews here, he is, in fact, IMHO, an evil person. If he does not beleive those things, but is merely trying to pick fights and be manipulative, its obvious he needs the shelter of geographical separation and relative anonymity that the list provides to protect him from people he would not dare to do these things to in person. He's likely to get his nose broken if he tried playing his games in real life.

While I understand the sentiment, the 'don't feel -- think!' quote is IMHO not meant as any sort of anti-extropian or anti-rationalist sentiment. I can only offer that from my own experience as an alpine ski racer as a child and in college that when you are in an athletic endeavor that is as fast paced as slalom racing (or sword/lightsaber fighting) where you very dynamically apply large amounts of force in precise amounts, constantly correcting from sensory feedback, you absolutely cannot depend on (and must often totally ignore) what your concious rational mind is telling you. It is what the cybernetics people call 'right brain' thinking, where you have developed such a large body of experience in the movements that it becomes second nature, where you can whip through a world cup slalom course while still thinking about laying on a beach. This is what I believe is meant by the quote.

"I'm curious about the "return on investment" in improving your current
mental, sensory, or physical abilities with currently available
techniques."

Is it worth it, in other words, to spend time and effort improving those
abilities?  That brings up a very fundamental question about what is
truly of value.  In my value system, quality of living, in terms of the
quality of everyday experiences is of the highest value.  

Because of the time I have spent improving my senses, my sensory world is
much sharper and more detailed.  All my senses seem far more intense to
me than before.  I go for walks now, and details that I never noticed
before stand out with no effort, such as vein patterns on the leaves of
bushes and trees or the texture of the sidewalk.  Everything is so sharp
and so clear, and the quality of each experience is far better than
before I started working on this.

Because the basic technique is about learning to pay more attention to
the senses, my capacity for paying attention has become much greater. 
Because I have spent so much time focused on paying attention to the
current moment, the current moment, with its complexity of experience has
become my main reality, whereas before I tended to be focused more on
abstract thinking, and I usually only noticed a very limited number of
features of any experience. 

The discipline I have followed seems to have sped up my ability to
process sensory information, because I consciously process much more of
it per unit of time than I used to, and my sense of time keeps getting
more stretched out and each unit of time seems longer and longer to me.  

I realize that I will always experience reality one moment at a time, so
my goal has been to learn to take advantage of each moment as fully as I
can.  Because I am so alert to each moment, I notice all kinds of things
very quickly that other people seem to ignore.  I notice subtle clues in
people's body movements and facial expressions that reveal things they do
not realize they are giving away.  I watch everything carefully, and I
learn as much as I can from each moment.

I'm also a "security freak", and I like to be intently aware of my
surroundings.  When I go for walks, I am able to scan every person,
vehicle, possible hiding places, etc. very quickly and assess their
potential danger to me.  Because of the training I have given myself, I
can do this quite effortlessly and tirelessly and automatically.

My training has also made it easier for me to learn new skills.  When I
watch others do things, I watch very intently, and I pay attention to
their exact motions and learn very quickly.  When I practice learning
something, I pay very close attention, and the intense feedback speeds
the learning process.

The advantages that come from the sort of training I have pursued for the
past few years are quite incredible and quite enjoyable.  From my
perspective, my quality of living is extremely high because each moment
is so incredibly rich and fascinating.

The training has also been very helpful in improving the quality of my
mental life, since the mind is so sensitive to feedback about itself. 
The more I pay attention to the reality of each moment, including my own
thinking, the more aware I am of things I do and think that are not
really in my best interest, and the faster I can change my thinking and
my behavior.  

The quality of thinking I experience now is much greater than I used to
experience.  Because I am so focused on the present moment of experience
and thought, I am much more aware of the more subtle aspects of my
thinking.  I pay more attention to all the thoughts and memories that my
experiences trigger.  Each thought triggers many other thoughts and
memories, and I simply watch the whole process.  

The act of paying attention to the process of the mind is the mind's way
of getting feedback on itself.  The mind watches itself and learns from
itself.  Thinking errors are noticed and discontinued.  Promising
creative thoughts are noticed and evaluated faster and developed faster
into good ideas.  Because of my stretched out sense of time, I feel that
I have more time to carefully think about things when I make decisions. 
Because I am so alert to my own mind, I understand my thinking and my
motives much better than before.

Improving physical abilities was mentioned also, but I would rather
discuss this topic later, since the techniques I use require lots of
explanation, and I am not adequately prepared to present my techniques at
this point.  But I will say that I have explored and extended the
capabilities of my body considerably, in terms of strength, agility,
dexterity, efficiency of movement, accuracy of movement, speed of
movement, etc.

I will present more of the techniques and approaches I have found helpful
in my own training, but this is enough for now.

Thank you for your attention.

Yep, it's me the "optimistic-keep-context" movie goer. Perhaps, I just
view life (movies) with sugary sweet rose colored glasses.... but, I
thought Star Wars was just fine. I am not some huge fan, nor am I one that
dislikes the movies.

I loved the hype, though. I wanted to be one of those that saw it the
first day out. I love the merchandising, capitalism, and technology. I am
a movie product manager's dream come true. I am all for people getting
excited about a movie, waiting in line for hours, and buying way too many
action figures.

---tangent about to occur--
I am tired of listening to the media and everyone else whine about Kosvo
and/or Columbine. I am sick of listening to misery. I want joy! I want
laughter! I want to skip and be joyous. If Star Wars can get into the news
for 10 mins and break down the usual force feeding of tragedy I am
constantly bombarded with to provide some flavor of excitement, I am ALL
for it! "Use the force."
---end of tangent---


So, back on track, to the movie *ahem* Let's keep a bit of context, shall
we? It is a MOVIE. It is for entertainment value. I have heard everything
from the characters suck to the mysticism being rationalized because it
does exist within the context of the movie. I hate to sound like the happy
one here, but lighten up. It is FUN! It is about going for the eye candy
and watching the United States as well as the rest of the world regroup in
a series of movies that in part changed how movies were done and what we
expected of them, forever. 

On the technical side, the computer animation is wonderful, the special
effects were outstanding. In regards to the character, they were fine. It
is a prequeal for crying out loud. The story is setting up, I do not
expect in-depth psychological analysis of each. I _loved_ the outfit
and make done for the Queen. And my final (the glass is
half full dammit) assessment about the mysticism, it is a sci/fi adventure
movie. If you are going to accept the idea of the the plot even existing
at all, considering  the idea of  "the force" isn't' that much more of a
stretch. If you want non-fantasy, watch the history channel.

Smile, it increases your face value. Life is wonderful, enjoy it. Go see
the movie, and love it. You know you wanna!

Challenge me!

Jocelyn Brown has been very helpful in her feedback, although I believe
some of my statements and questions have been interpreted differently
than I intended them.  As a writer, it is in my best interest to be clear
in my meaning, so I will clarify.

At some point, I asked:

"Is it absolutely essential that people believe in the fictional concept
of "property rights" in order to interact productively and peacefully?"

Jocelyn and others believe that "This is diametrically opposed to
libertarian politics and objectivist philosophy."

I don't see how questioning assumptions is diametrically opposed to
libertarianism or objectivism.  All I did was ask whether it was
"absolutely essential" for people to believe in property rights.  I was
thinking that whoever said that property rights were *absolutely*
essential for people to interace peacefully and productively was being a
bit extreme in the position.  I understand very well the benefits of
property rights, but I also understand that it is POSSIBLE for people to
be productive and peaceful even if they don't have a formal concept of
property rights.  I believe there are certain kinds of people who would
do just fine without that concept.  However, me questioning whether
property rights are absolutely essential cannot logically be interpreted
as me advocating the abolition of property rights.  I was just asking a
simple question; no need to get upset about it.  Extremest thinking tends
to warp one's interpretation of others' statements and questions.


I mentioned at some point that I like to "push people's buttons"

Jocelyn feels that "Intentially pushing people's buttons is not an act of
respect."

I will strive to push your buttons unintentionally from now on.  Just
kidding.  Although, maintaining psychological weaknesses and then
demanding that others avoid "pushing your buttons" is also disrespectful
of others.  I don't believe I was being unnecessarily rude to anyone. 
Button pushing has always been a form of playfulness in my family, so I
do not consider moderate amounts of it to be disrespectful, but rather an
act of affection.  


At some point, I wrote, "Because you are so full of hostility, you do not
realize that we actually agree on pretty much everything."

Jocelyn wrote, in response, "Your 'I am angry' diatribe was full of
hostility, yet you use that concept to dismiss others."

I do not see how reassuring someone that we "agree on pretty much
everything" could be interpreted as dismissing them.  Please explain.


At some point, I wrote, "Because I am intelligent, I would use your own
deepest desires to change whatever behaviors I wanted to."

Jocelyn believes, "this statement is about as condescending as one can
get."

When you buy a product at the store isn't whoever you bought the product
from using your desires to modify your behavior?  If someone uses a
persuasive argument, aren't they taking advantage of your desires to
modify your behavior?  Since I have decided to refrain from using force
to change your behavior, my remaining options include mainly offering you
something you desire in exchange for you modifying your behavior.  A
classic example is paying someone money to have them do work for you. 
Isn't using people's desires to get what you want from them a basic part
of the free market system we advocate?  Yet you see it as condescending
when stated baldly.  


Jocelyn wrote, "I don't that this feedback will help, but please don't
respond unless it's a point-by-point response that directly addresses my
comments."

Your feedback was quite helpful, as it gave me the opportunity to clarify
my meaning to the list. 

Thank you.

It fits in with the rest of the "philosophy" mentioned in the
movies. The goal of much of eastern mysticism (and the wisdom of Yoda
is borrowed from there, of course) is to achieve a state of freely
flowing action, where you don't have to consciously think in order to
act right. The way of reaching this is of course practice, practice,
practice.

The trick is to be good enough at what you are doing so that you don't
have to involve the messy prefrontal planning systems, and use them
for the new and uncertain situations instead.

OK, confession time:

You know those Cisco ads, where adorable children of the world say
things like "A population the size of the United Kingdom joins the
internet every six months," and then they say "Are you ready?"

It makes me cry.

Actually, the damaging part of the concept isn't the idea "Don't
think--feel!"  The damaging part is the idea that there's a sharp
distinction.  Any information the brain processes is input to
rationality.  That includes instinct, and intuition, and any other data
that gets produced by any cognitive process.

I remember studying for the SAT at age 11.  I took the first Math
practice section and got a 600.  I took the second one and got a 560.  I
took the third one and got a 540.  Going over the problems, I realized
that my first guess, my first impression, was right more often than my
second-guessing; as I tried to compensate by increasing second-guessing,
my scores went down.  So I took another practice test, rapidly and
without self-consciousness, acting, as Obi-Wan would say, "on instinct",
and got a 640.  I figured that was good enough and stopped practicing;
on the eventual SAT a few months later, I got a 740 in Math.  I *trust*
my intuitions, not for any mystical reason, but because they're always right.

My father has a lecture about how Star Trek destroyed American
engineering by teaching managers to say "Dammit, Scotty, I need it done
in five minutes, not two weeks."  I think that Star Trek destroyed
American culture through the Mr. Spock stereotype, that "rational
thinking" is high-precision math incapable of understanding emotions. 
Star Trek is also responsible for the failure of AI, psychiatric idiocy,
Skinnerian behaviorism, string theory, and the hole in the ozone layer,
but I digress.

By comparision, Star Wars's "Use the Force" would simply seem to state
an additional input.  What Lorrey said.

Of course, I haven't seen Episode I.  I don't think I plan to, since the
nonstop hype has managed to instill feelings of nausea whenever I hear
the words "Star Wars".  If they'd just *released* it, I would have gone
to see it.  As it is, I'd rather see _The Matrix_ a third time.

Well... I aint saying it aint pretty...
All I'm saying is...there is a "dark side" to this movie and the ideas
behind it.

Also, I visited your website. Wow, another hot extropian babe :-)
Yet another reason to attend those extropian conventions....

BTW, I like John Stossel, too. He is a *thinker* rather than a
*feeler*, generally speaking.

Your error, which both Jocelyn and I believe is 'evil'  is to believe that property rights are a 'fictional concept'. Since they originate in Natural Law, they are not any more fictional than the real world is.

The only societies which are both productive and peaceful which do not develop property rights are primitive tribal cultures which are in ecosystems where the basic daily requirements for life are easily met from a hunter/gatherer lifestyle. Moreover, you will never find any society which has absolutely no concept of property rights, just differing interpretations of what an individual person can call 'personal' property, except for troops of monkeys or hives of insects.

I agree with David Musick that it is worth examining the concept of
property rights.  I would not approach this with the idea of stripping
anyone of their property (so jerk those knees back down).  Rather,
consider a voluntary society (a space station, say), and consider in
what ways property rights are useful and beneficial, and in what ways
other ways of organizing resources may work better.

This is a utilitarian rather than natural-rights approach to property
rights (and other social institutions) and is IMO well within the
mainstream of extropian thought.

We are already aware of situations where other methods than property
rights are used to control access to resources.  Within families there are
many resources which are commonly available to all.  Within firms it is
also common to organize the companies efforts on a command basis rather
than by means of a market.  Even in society as a whole, many resources
which difficult to manage with market mechanisms (like unpolluted air,
and whales) are handled in other ways.

There is a "theory of the firm" in economics which explores in detail
the question of when markets vs other organizational structures should
be used within corporations.  This is not an immoral enterprise, but it
gives us useful information on the nature of reality which we can use
to guide our efforts.

I also agree with David that property rights are a social construct
and in that sense can be considered "fictional" (perhaps "cultural"
would be a better word).  We had a discussion a few months ago about
abstract property rights, like intellectual property, ownership of the
EM spectrum, solar energy rights, unobstructed views, whaling rights,
and other entities which some people have tried to allocate with market
mechanisms.  For some people it was obvious which things are "natural"
property and which are not, but in my view it comes down to social
agreements about what will be treated as ownable.

As in my prior reply, your contention that property rights are a 'fictional concept'. Property is a concept of Natural Law, and trying to fictionalize something as real as that is just another meme that the totalitarian forces use to destroy the rights of the individual. It is evil in every sense of the word.

How have I done that? I did observe that if you practice your rude, obnoxious, condescending ways of poking people's buttons in real life, I wouldn't be surprised if you got your nose broken at least once for your actions. That is not to imply that it would be me doing it. I consider myself a rather non-violent and non-confrontational person, but I am rather adamant about defending my own rights. I will not ever shy away from that. The price of freedom is eternal vigilance. Live free or die, death is not the worst of evils. No one who values the freedom of the individual need fear me. Those that don't, do, though.

If anyone is using straw man tactics, it is you.

Elizabeth:

That is a favorite of mine as well. If you are interested in a digital
version (or if anyone else is interested) you can see that commercial at
the following location:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/750/ads.html

Also, just for information sake, the ad agency that created the spot is
Goldberg Moser O'Neill, San Francisco. The ad is called "Mouths
Of Babes." They originally came out in August of 1998. There is also a
listing for the other ad that follows the same idea listed on the page.

Yes, entertaining, but did they convince you to open an account? That's the
*only* true purpose of advertising. If a commercial doesn't convince you to
buy, it flopped.

Alas, it appears that monopoles don't exist.  And now, stay tuned for our
next episode of 'As the Standard Model Turns'....

But actually, I was thinking of a high-density soup of many kinds of
subatomic particles (see, I'm vague enough to survive the next annual
revision of the particle zoo).   You tailor the mass of the underlying
gravity well to give you the correct pressure/temperatur regime for your
preferred mix of particles, then build the computer on its surface.  I'd
expect it to end up being some weird mix of exotic particles, half of them
things that we don't know about yet.

Hmm.  Maybe 2-3 solar masses per computer, with a probable diameter of 10-30
km each.  How about we put a few hundred of them in close orbit around each
other, in a volume of space a few tens of thousands of miles across?
(Computing the trajectories will obviously not be a problem.)  Enclose the
whole structure with a shell a few light-seconds across (and a few hundred
km thick, with lots of firepower), with a few solar masses worth of robotics
on the outside, and you've got a pretty nice SI body.  The total budget is
only around a thousand solar masses, so we can support a substantial
population just by dismantling the Milky Way.

> Questions for Thought and Study:
>
> 1.  What is the maximum size/mass of a JB constructed of monopolium?

I don't think we have the physics to compute this - we'd have to know
exactly what kind of environment we needed to maintain to make stable
structures possible.

> 2.  How much computing power would it have?

Well, let's see.  Based on Drexler's work, we might estimate nanocomputers
at something in the general neighborhood of 10^14 MIPS per cubic cm (for
electronic computers with no special benefits from expiating quantum
effects).  For a Jupiter brain 100,000 km in diameter, with 10% of its mass
actually used for computers, that gives us about 10^43 MIPS.  It takes about
a second for an electrical signal to cross that distance, so the time
required for information to propagate through the entire system should be
<10 seconds.

If we increase the component density by a factor of 10^16 (taking a
middle-of-the-road estimate), switching to degenerate matter boosts our
speed to 10^30 MIPS per cubic cm.  For a computer in the form of a thin
shell covering the surface of a neutron star, 10 km in diameter and 10 m
thick, that would give us 10^45 MIPS. The communications lag drops to <1 ms.
More optimistic assumptions would give much greater computing power (10^49
MIPS for a 1 km thick shell at your 10^18 density figure, for instance).

> 3.  How much time would a unified thought take to cross the JB?

Maybe a few seconds for the nanotech brain, or a few milliseconds for the
degenerate matter version.  Of course, the appropriate thing to compare that
to is the time required for all of human civilization to hear about and
understand a new idea.  A cubic centimeter of the picotech machine could
support the equivalent of 10^22 human minds, with a communication lag of a
few microseconds.  A human-equivalent mind (in a VR) could easily experience
a time rate billions of times faster than ours.

Well, Hans Moravec pegs the human brain at 10^8 MIPS.  That means the
nanotech brain has 10^35 times as much computing power, and the picotech
system has 10^37.

Not really a significant effect in either case.

Everything does.

That's easy.  If you have a SETI program, there aren't any JBs out there.

Urk.  Umm - we're going to be measuring that in Sols (1 Sol = the energy
output of the sun).  I don't have a handy estimate for this - does anyone
else?  We'd better put a black hole in the middle of that JB cluster to
power the thing.

Not easily estimated, since you have to trade off between lags due to
physical distance and lags due to relativistic slowdown - those orbits are
going to be rather fast.

Using a JB clustering arrangement like the one above, you could easily fit a
few dozen individuals into a space the size of the solar system.  Space
these groups closely and you can probably condense the whole galaxy into a
few hundred million individuals living in a space a few light years across.
That would give you communication lags of hours to years (depending on who
you want to talk to), and atrocious crowding.

Obviously, the JBs are far more isolated.

Jetzen!

You guys are killing me. Yet another favorite of mine.  The Lotus
commercials are right up there on my top 10 list. I also adore the Denis
Leary Capitalism/Technology ads from Lotus. 

Specifically, The "I am" commercials caused me a bit of trouble. It took
nearly two weeks to get someone to send me the real from IBM. It should be
here in short order, however, Anyone intersted in downloading the spot for
personal use only, is welcome to contact me. The R5 site does not carry
the ad, and says they have no plans to put it up due to the constant
complaints from DC Comics fans.

If you are intersted in the Leary Lotus Ads you can find them at:

There are tons, the Capitalism and People's Party are my favorites. Oh

The bottom line man! Gotta love it.  I do indeed have an account with
them. I in fact support all products of commercials that I see great
work done on. That is if I am not allegoric,(ie: coconut) or there is some
other weird reason keeping me from supporting them. I ALWAYS put my money
wear my mouth is. I am a capitalist of course. At the end of the day, I am
concerned about the bottom line too ;)

I think you are a bit off-base with respect to the technique and the
technology.

First of all, the correct way to do this is *not* to compress the spectrum
to fit within the human range.  With regard to this technique, the problems
mentioned above are valid.  The correct technique is to overlay our natural
frequency window with shifted windows from other parts of the spectrum.
Audio spectrum overlays are a lot more processing intensive, but they are
much more effective at representing information outside the human range,
and do so with little or no loss of information.

Even within the normal audio range, the difference between the amount of
information in the signal and the amount of information we can perceive in
a given frequency range is quite large, and gets larger the closer you get
to the ends of our audio range.  This frequency dependent information loss
is a primary reason spectrum compression doesn't work.  Windowing maintains
the normal frequency separation, but creates a "busier" environment within
the normal range, which is something our brains are adept at handling.  Our
audio cortex works much better with good frequency separation and a busy
spectrum than a quiet spectrum and poor frequency separation.  The thing to
remember is that the human ability to separate sounds is a logarithmic
function of frequency, which goes a long way towards explaining why
spectrum compression doesn't work very well.

There are signal processing algorithms that allow us to shift frequencies
outside of our normal range into our audio range with very little loss of
information.  With good signal processing hardware available today, the
processing loss floor will fall below the perceptive loss at its smallest.
The two biggest problems with this kind of augmentation are 1) it increases
the amount of signal in our fixed perception space that we have to process,
and 2) it misrepresents the actual frequency of the sound (e.g. you hear a
32 kHz tone as a 4 kHz tone).

The first probably won't be much of a problem most of the time.  Our brains
are already adept at dealing with noisy audio environments.  The second is
a little more of a problem.  The best solution I can think of is to add an
unusual or unnatural harmonic to shifted signals (e.g. "wave shaping") that
will allow the listener to associate a sound with a frequency range.  If
well done it would allow the listener to differentiate signals without
being able to consciously "hear" the added harmonics.  Many audio harmonics
act as something of a meta-signal to the brain.  They describe the nature
of the sound to the brain (the "feeling"), but we do not consciously
perceive the harmonics themselves.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

Rather than try to reply to all of the insightful posts
regarding 'psychotherapy, science fiction, and sanity', I'll
try to summarize my ideas in one post.

In large part, I think most of us agree on certain aspects
of what a 'sane' person would be, as particularly outlined
in Max More's Extropian Principles - Pancritical
Rationalism, Practical Optimism, the use of Korzybski's
E-Prime, as well as the assistance of advancing
technological augmentations.  The pathway towards rational
behavior is well laid out.  I think the path gets sticky
however when dealing with the other aspects of the psyche -
especially the emotional ones.  All of us on this list have
at one time or another found ourselves caught in flamed
discussions.  As much we try, I can't think of anyone on the
list who hasn't had an overly emotional reaction at least
once.  As much as we pride ourselves on extropian values,
and rational thought, there is still lots of room for
improvement.  If you feel you do not fit in this category
and our the pinnacle of sanity, then you will be in much
demand as a psychotherapist for the rest of us.  :-)

I am aware of at least two 'technologies' and methods not
mentioned yet, that offer great promise in increasing sanity
and long-term happiness.  The first is the drug Ecstasy,
which we now unfortunately realize has very bad long-term
side effects with prolonged use.  This drug was made illegal
in 1986.  I had the fortune to try it a couple of times
before then.  If anyone else out there has tried it, I'm
certain you will concur with me that its effects can be
positively profound.  In less than 6 hours, I was able to
work through several emotional trauma's and neurotic
hang-ups, re-assess my world outlook, experience a state of
genuine unprecedented happiness, and relax and undo muscular
tension which had plagued me for years.  Although the
experience itself comes to an end, the positive effects can
last forever.  After my first experience, I was convinced
this drug would heal all of the worlds problems and bring an
end to war.  To a certain degree I still believe this.  The
problem with ecstasy however, is that it is only effective
as a psychotherapeutic agent  2 or 3 times, after which it
acts as simple amphetamine.  The reason seems to be a
long-term depletion of seratonin and eventually if
continued, serious damage to dendritic/axonic pathways.

Despite the technical problems with ecstasy, its effects
hint at a neurological re-engineered pathway to increased
happiness and emotional sanity.  If only research into the
drug were legal, and billions of dollars of research could
be focused on isolating its positive effects and eliminating
its negative ones, could we have a genuine extropian mind
tool of unprecedented power.

Another tool which is perfectly legal, is the use of a
flotation tank.  Although its effects are not nearly as
powerful as ecstasy, it can substantially help you relax
your body and focus your mind.  I've found it quite useful
in clearing out daily residue and mental noise.

The use of Ecstasy + Flotation Tank = even more powerful
change.   The second time I tried ecstasy I took it moments
before embarking on a 90 minute float session.  To quickly
summarize, the events of the float itself were uneventful,
but my re-emergence from the tank was totally profound.  It
was as if I took an entirely new body imprint.  My body felt
alien, new, better, stronger, healthier.  When I left the
float center, the world seemed entirely new.  I realized
then and there the utter subjectivity of my existence and
the power our minds have in shaping that existence.  As
trite as it sounds, I realized that if everyone could
permanently achieve these states I'm experiencing, the world
could end war, poverty and all other means of suffering.
That things like limited resources, economic upheavals and
the like, exist in large part because of the limits of our
own thinking, feeling and acting.  Instead of squandering
our resources, they could be focused towards increased
efficiency, intelligence increase, life extension, space
migration, scientific and technological advance.

For a fantastic and complete treatment of these issues, I
suggest reading David Pearce's 'Hedonistic Imperative' at
http://www.hedweb.com/welcome.htm

Nice work, I hope it will make even more children think. I can hardly

     Thank You, Gene, for writing this reply in my stead.  I've had a couple of very hectic days, and I didn't consider it worth wasting time on answering this type of argument, but if I had, I would have written something along the same line.  This kind of Emperor's New Clothes argument is not terribly impressive:

     "Hey teach, what you're telling us about Marxism makes no sense."  
     "Well, that is because you have a confused mind, as a result of capitalism.  When you achieve a clear mind you will understand Marxism"  
     "Oh, I see, that makes a lot of sense. -- NOT!!!"  
     (Social Psychology class at my college)

     "I'm sorry (says one of the female students in my class), but I don't really see that the Evil Patriarchy is oppressing me as a woman, the way we are taught."
     "That is because you need to have your consciousness raised.  Once your consciousness has been raised, you will realize that you are a victim of the Evil Patriarchy."
     "Thank you.  I will try to raise my consciousness."
     (This is from a course in contemporary feminist philosophy at my college, and the student's reply was, to her credit, more like "Gaaahhh!"  It's funny, in my days, raising your consciousness was something you used drugs to accomplish, and then you were supposed to drop out.  Today you are supposed to raise your consciousness in order to be able to understand what the heck your college course really is about.  Times do change.)

     "Excuse me (says I), but I have no wish to waste time on reading bad poetry and leftist mumbo-jumbo which I've heard a thousand times before. If I wanted to read bad poetry I'd subscribe to badpoetry@onelist.com straight away.  Hence, I filter out postings from those who fill their messages with the aforementioned."
     "That is because you are suffering from mental fragility."
     "Oh, I see.  Thank you for pointing this out.  I'll immediately go to onelist and subscribe to every mailing list which concerns itself with something in which I am NOT interested, like marxism@onelist and hocuspocus@onelist, just to try to prove that I am not suffering from mental fragility."

     On the other hand, I think I'll pass.  Although it saddens me to have to do so, I already have to unsubscribe from some lists to which I am currently subscribed.  In every list to which I am subscribed there are messages I delete unread, since they discuss things which do not interest me.  I have always done this, and I never had any idea that this was a symptom of mental fragility.  Despite my reducing the mail load in this fashion, time does not suffice to read what remains.  I will remain subscribed to the most interesting lists, but I reserve the right not to have to read every single posting to these lists.  If this is considered a sign of mental fragility, then so be it.  (This topic, for instance, has little to do with extropy, and I expect that many subscribers to this list by now delete every message with "Provocation error" in the subject line, since they would rather read messages which are about things more related to extropy.  I can't blame them.  I'd probably do the same if I weren't involved in this thread.)
                                                   Ian

     Ehm?  Excuse me, Emlyn, but on what do you base this belief?  What manner of magical powers enable you to discern how I have set the filters in my e-mail program?  The message to which I replied was written by KPJ, whom I have not filtered out.

Yes, I've though of this.  It has some potential for audio, as you correctly
point out, because we have a robust ability to filter out unwanted audio
data and concentrate on the important parts.  You can't do that with video,
of course, but you could set up a system that lets you switch your vision
between  different slices of the spectrum.  However, this kind of approach
is still severely limited in the amount of enhancement it can support.

With either audio or video we can easily build sensors that will collect
thousands of times as much data as our natural sensors.  with audio you can
increase the range of frequency response by more than an order of magnitude,
increase sensitivity by several orders of magnitude, and implement selective
amplification and roving remote microphones.  With video we can get vision
of varying resolution all the way from radio frequencies to soft x-rays, in
all directions, with telescopic and microscopic enhancements for large parts
of the spectrum.  In both cases, no possible mapping scheme is going to let
you keep up with more than a small fraction of that data.

Ultimately, if you want the best senses that technology can build, you will
have to resort to creating new brain structures to process the data.
Otherwise you aren't significantly better off than someone with a good
wearable computer and a bunch of cameras & microphones.

I'll have to disagree on several points here.  First, I
think is possible to be completely sane and irrational.
A person who knowingly chooses a noncritical epistemology
and metphysics--a devout Christian, for example--is not
rational, but otherwise functions adequately according to
eir own sub-optimal choices, can interact usefully with
others, and is otherwise not "insane", in the sense that
ey is competent to make eir own choices, even if they are
bad ones.  I've always seen E-prime as a gimmick vaguely
related to clarity of thought and expression, but it is
so easy to come up with murky E-Prime and precise English
that I'm not convinced it's a good thing in general.
Finally, I'm not yet entirely convinced that optimism is
optimal.  I do see some of Max's points as valuable, but
most of them are just rational.  I can't think of a single
decision I have made in my life on the basis of optimism
that wasn't just a rational choice for other reasons, and
even if there were a connection, I wouldn't call a 
pessimist "insane", even if ey was unpleasant to be around.
Indeed, I might seek eir advice before embarking upon some
risky venture to see if ey had better ideas about what
might go wrong.

I don't much care either way.  But I will add (no pun) some more noise to
the list.  Ads are not made to just get people to buy products.  They are
also made to get name and product recognition.

This is a good point.

 It seems entirely plausible that we will add on new structures to our
brains.  And, perhaps a new brain layer.  (Max has a current chapter on
this, in fact, I don't know whether it is ok to comment on now.)

When I think of radical sensory enhancements, I think of mega processing
power and all sorts of router systems and intelligent agents working away
steadily to allow a vast array of awarenesses to asthetically alert my
consciousness.  I'd like the "sensorial aesthetic awareness" it to drive
like an smoothly steered vehicle.  (But I'll have to discuss this with
Anders a bit.)

I look forward to Max's work.  Perhaps a new brain layer, but I'm more inclined
to see a more thorough reorganization of our entire brain structure as we add on
more processing power and increased and varied input.  Even without any new
sensory input, it seems advantageous to be able to process existing input in
entirely new ways.  Why not see smells, hear colors, and smell sounds?
Synasthesia requires no new sensors, only a re-organization of our current
processing.  I'm very exciting by Steve Mann's work in this area.  I would love
to try on his sonar suit, and omni-directionally feel my environment up to 100
meters.

This is how I have always imagined it.  I would very much like to hear more of
your thinking on this.  I have always seen my future nano-self as a vehicle
fully immersed in an omni-directional, fully synaesthetic continuum.  A
continuum that morphs and changes based on input from any imaginable source as
well as how my internal constructs wish that data to be presented.  Imagine the
possibility of having 'sexual' and fully orgasmic experiences while one's
mini-probes explores the unique topography of a new planet?  I can't think of a
better way to discover the unique nuances of a new geology as one would a new
lover.

Actually I agree with you to a certain extent, and I would go further by
saying I also think its possible to be completely rational and also insane.
It all depends on how we are defining the terms.  Despite Hanibal Lecter's
fictional status, it could be argued that the he is not sane, but very
capable of rational thought.

I would argue that a person who makes better decisions than another is more
sane.  In the context of my previous post, I'm attempting to develop a
definition of sanity that's determined as much by a persons emotional
well-being, as it is on rational thought and action.

Like any tool, E-prime has its niche.  I personally find it quite useful in
clarifying my perception of the relativity of subjective experience.

I agree with you completely here.  Sorry if my post led you to believe
otherwise.

I love the idea of being able to tailor your senses as you see fit in
real time. Experiencing the world primarily through tactile senses, or
sight, adding "erotic sense" to the way you experience the mundane -
Fantastic!

This raises the problem of communication difficulties. This is not a new
idea, but one worthy in the context I think. We communicate through a
shared view of the universe, common experience - most communication
problems seem to stem from different, clashing, incompatible views.

If we are all tailoring our senses independently, choosing our view of
reality to match our moods, personalities, utilitarian necessity, or
whatever reasons, we will find it very difficult to exchange information
and ideas. Say that you are seeing infrared, for example, and someone
else is mapping visual range onto their olfactory senses. "That guy
looks a bit hot, with some interesting cool patches around the
extremities, greens and blues, don't you think so?" "No, I think he's
saltier than green, maybe a touch of lime." Or "XDFFrwe eedtfrr fdfsg
dcdsfe dees sa #$%" Or ". *FLASH* Remember!"

Imagine if you have restructured the very way your brain works, and
others have done the same, although in different ways. You start
becoming a whole culture in yourself, with cultural incompatibilities
between each individual. This is already true, but not entirely
debilitating socially. You would even be having communication problems
with your past self, your own memories. If they have come through a set
of sensory filters which have changed radically over time, and have been
processed by differing processing structures, running at differing
speeds, and with varying internal organisation, what could you make of
your past?

This topic has been covered with respect to Transhuman<->human
communication (something about humans and ants), but what about
Transhuman<->Transhuman. 

Eliezer said
According to these assumptions, far from being mutually telepathic, the
future may be filled with individuals far more alone than we ever were. 

This was on the topic of JBs, but I think it will apply far sooner. From
reading Steve Mann's piece on this list recently, I think he feels the
effects of communication difficulties because of his different view of
reality (although that said, his piece communicated his world
eloquently, and effected me strongly).

I was going to assume that most of you would regard human language as
far too crude for post-singularity entities. I'm learning not to assume
anything on this list. But language is something which binds our varied
personalities, helps our island sanctuaries of self to connect up, by
providing a common ground for communication. Still, it relies heavily on
shared experience for understanding, and the communication seems to be
to a large part illusory, with each party thinking they have
communicated, when in fact neither understands the other (although we
don't get any of that on THIS list, do we).

Of course we are all already quite different, and we already have
communication difficulties (!). I wonder how this will progress.

What kinds of answers are there to these problems?

- Language - crude but (in)effective? Sustain the illusion - we can both
say the word "red", even though our understandings of it would vary
wildly.

- Create universal communication formats, fundamental structures for
ideas and thoughts, which could be interchanged and processed by anyone.
Same drawbacks as normal language, but maybe with less chance of picking
up miscommunication. Plus, I challenge anyone to describe such a format
to any useful degree. Come on, you know you want to...

- Maybe advances in communications technologies and processing power and
understanding of intelligence can get us to a point where a universal
translator can be employed. Perhaps individuals can connect to each
other and use some magical (far off technological) process to tune in to
each others modes of thought, and communicate thusly. But this implies
there is some overall structure to and limitation upon the possible ways
of being sentient, and that they could all be catered for - a dodgy
proposition at best.

- Hunker down in the hills: we can all run off to our respective solar
systems, surround ourselves with mines and armadas, and shoot whatever
moves.

When we say Human, we can get a fuzzy but useful concept of what that
means. But when we say Transhuman, all bets are off. As a grouping noun,
it is about as useful as words like "natural" and "organic" when used to
describe the elements it groups.

There's a real weird world coming, and I can barely wait!

You know, there are several commercials that I love just because they look so
good, and could watch time and time again. But I couldn't tell you what 
they're actually advertising, because the visuals are so compelling that
the actual 'message' is lost in the noise. In fact I've seen a couple of 
commercials lately where I couldn't even *tell* what they're advertising.

I love good commercials because they have some of the best film-making in
the world, but I really wonder sometimes whether the companies who pay
vast amounts of money for them actually think about what they're paying
for.

I will be going to the Foresight group genius weekend and in consideration 
of the small space in my hotmail account, will attempt to move it to my 
nanogirl@halcyon.com. Otherwise, it will have to many collected messages in 
my box and simply delete themselves.

When my appearance of unsubscribe appears, it will be merely a change of 
email address. I would not leave such a fellowship of thought!

I'll be leaving tomarrow morning, I'm so excited I could just, well never 
mind!! The new aspect of this meeting is using the design shop method or 
grouping together, this was described in a book called Leaping the Abyss by 
Chris Peterson and Gayle Pergamit.

There is a slight chance I may be able to check out your emails over my 
absence on my (new and resourcful toy)palm pilot, but highly unlikely due to 
the big phone bill it would create. Happy trails until we meet again.

Best general knowledge search engine? There is no such a thing. It all
depends on what you are searching. Personally I find AltaVista
advanced search http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=aq&what=web&text=yes
and Google http://www.google.com/search?q=&num=100&sa=Google%2BSearch
complementary (and useful enough to make them buttons on the local
home page).

Actually, Sayke, I usually use the search engine you first showed me:
Dogpile.com, which seems a rather comprehensive general search engine.
Works every time.

with Dogpile and Google.

I use an application called webferret that runs on my machine and queries all of the major search engines, coming up with as long a list as I want, like in file manager, which I can sort as I like by name, date, etc. I beleive I got it from the C/NET download site.

Does anyone know of any reputable offshore pharmacies, preferably

know that you can get Nootropics, but I'm wondering if you can get more
standard medications.

He he.  I like your style - lots of fun to read.

Your right in concluding that increasing customization of personal experience is a
vector away from a consensus protocol.  On the other hand, these capabilities
assume increasing nanotechnological maturity, which would increase our capacity to
swap information and experience directly without the need for language or any
other second-level abstraction.  Will these two opposing vectors balance each
other or will one accelerate faster than another?   I think it all comes down to
each individual along a spectrum of socialization just as it does now.  Some
people like to socialize more than others. We have lots of communities which have
developed a consensus, sharing values, slang, jargon, likes and dislikes, yet who
have difficulty in communicating with other communities.  I think the same will
occur in the future only to much larger extent and with vastly greater diversity -
a post-human equivalent of the cambrian explosion.  I see billions of increasingly
unique dividuals, with the majority of them hooking up into a wide assortment of
transient adhoc communities based on aesthetics and/or utility.  These communities
could last a few seconds or could go on for centuries.  Other factors determining
the nature of these mind-networks would be inevitable economic constraints based
on limited material or information resources.  As someone pointed out earlier, not
everyone can have a Jupiter brain and stay in this solar system.  So the next
question becomes who gets what materials, and who is forced to leave the solar
system to find bounty elsewhere?

Such a competitive system would seem to favor the forming of increasingly larger
mind-networks.  Such mind-networks would require an increasingly universal set of
protocols to allow the largest number of diverse individuals to communicate
effectively.  The new book 'Earthweb' is about all of the people of Earth coming
together through the super-Internet to collaborate on a project requiring the
unique talents of each individual.  Such large universal networks obviously have
an advantage in this respect.  A lesson from ecology is a network that fosters
diversity would also seem to have an advantage over one that requires too much
conformity.  It's been the biodiversity of Earth's past that increased its odds
successfully of surviving a series of cataclysmic events.

To conclude, it would be in your own aesthetic self-interest to increasingly
customize your experience.  It would be in the Networks best interest to develop a
protocol universal enough to incorporate you.  A win-win situation if you ask me.

"As in my prior reply, your contention that property rights are a 'fictional

the word."

Property rights are not fictional, but I don't think they could rightly be
called a concept of Natural Law.  I offer the Native Americans as an
example, whose egalitarian lifestyle was indicative of the lack of property
rights.  Communism, although a pipe dream, attempted to destroy property
rights, but capitalists are, in my experience, greedy and materialistic.  So
although david_musik was incorrect about property rights being fictitious,
you were also incorrect assuming the extreme opposite, in that property
rights are made necessary by Natural Law.

"How have I done that? I did observe that if you practice your rude,
obnoxious, condescending ways of poking people's buttons in real life, I
wouldn't be surprised if you got your nose broken at least once for your
actions. That is not to imply that it would be me doing it. I consider
myself a rather non-violent and non-confrontational person, but I am rather
adamant about defending my own rights. I will not ever shy away from that.
The price of freedom is eternal vigilance. Live free or die, death is not
the worst of evils. No one who values the freedom of the individual need
fear me. Those that don't, do, though.

"If anyone is using straw man tactics, it is you."

Okay, this has got to stop.  I'm talking about the mudslinging, gentlemen.
I would suggest you read Irvine Welsh's "The Acid House," for one story in
particular, although the title elludes me currently.  I do believe it's
called "Philosophers" or something.  Reminds me of the controlled anger I'm
reading here.  "I wouldn't be surprised if you got your nose broken at least
once," "I and others know now to avoid you for our own safety."  You sound
like animals who understand diplomacy and are just saying enough not to
start a war but to stir each other's blood.  Shake hands, back off, do
whatever you have to do, but stop whining and finger-pointing, and remember
that everyone's opinion matters; maybe not to you, but to at least one
person, they do.  That's all that matters.  For a list touting enlightenment
and tolerance and the advancement of the species, this seems slightly
detrimental to the process and degrading on the whole.  Any problems?

No, you don't get it, Michael.  You can't call someone 'evil.'  That's about
as rude as you can get.  So he's a bit of a smart-ass.  Ignore him.  If you
are a mature adult, this shouldn't be too difficult.  I'm kind of interested
in what he has to say.  So what if he's a blunt and condescending creature.
He hasn't outright called anyone 'evil' or some other horribly demeaning
name.  He sounds rather arrogant, but that's just personality.  Grow up a
bit, learn to accept other people for what they are, and if there's a flaw
in his argument, attack the flaw, not the person.  I'd like to see you
dissect his argument (which I've only seen a little of, but you had some
viable points), not allude to stabbing knives in his gut...

Your error, which both Jocelyn and I believe is 'evil'  is to believe that
property rights are a 'fictional concept'. Since they originate in Natural
Law, they are not any more fictional than the real world is.

The only societies which are both productive and peaceful which do not
develop property rights are primitive tribal cultures which are in
ecosystems where the basic daily requirements for life are easily met from a
hunter/gatherer lifestyle. Moreover, you will never find any society which
has absolutely no concept of property rights, just differing interpretations
of what an individual person can call 'personal' property, except for troops
of monkeys or hives of insects.

Condescending lies are extremely rude. We obviously don't agree on much or

Regarding Mark's comments about the message of an ad getting lost in the
noise (visuals, celebrity endorser, etc.), this is a common problem in
advertising.  Saatchi & Saatchi are probably the archtypical ad agency
re putting creativity over strategy (ie, getting the message across).
Same with the Diesel (Jeans) ads - they look cool, but unless you've
followed them closely, what are they promoting?

Brilliant.

I don't know about the whole "I want the world shown to me as happy and
shiny; keep all that bad stuff away from me" pov, considering ignorance
isn't truly that blissful.  The Star Wars review was exactly what's been
going on in my head, save the hype.  The only thing that frightens me about
the release of the new trilogy is that it's bringing out fans of the movies
who seem more like trekkies - I'm not a big fan of trekkies.  I know, Star
Trek has been a bit more regular in its releasing of new products, but I
kinda expected Star Wars fans to have a bit more integrity...I guess I was
mistaken.  Nothing personal.  As far as the characters and acting are
concerned:

The characters were interesting, fit the classic melodrama roles, and had
decent lines.  What's the problem?  The only problem I had was that there
weren't enough British actors used; the first trilogy was filled with
British extras, who in my opinion have more pleasant voices - an example
would be the pilot of Queen Amidala's ship, who sounds like he's from
Brooklyn (maybe a taxi driver?).  I'll quote a friend of mine who said,
"People were going to that movie expecting to see the reincarnation of
Christ."  I'm referring to, of course, Jake Lloyd as Anakin.  Give him a
break, the kid did a pretty damn good job.  So he didn't seem like the 12 yr
old that Lucas was claiming, but he was innocent and cute, which will make
his transformation into Darth Vader even that much more amusing.

Which brings me to my next point, and that is the aspect of the movie that I
loved the most, apart from the stunning special effects.  Dramatic Irony.
Love it, can't live without it.  I love being able to laugh at the screen
when I know what's really going on.  Oh well, I'll cut this short, but
everyone should check this movie out, for sheer entertainment value, of
which it has much.

I am glad to see that this list supports hateful people.  I saw the same
thing happening on Genius-L, and although in that case I had no sympathy for
the person being attacked, I think Mr. Musick could possibly have things to
say.  I agree that the way he has been handled on here has been less than
delicate, and you have asked for any condescencion he has dropped on your
shoulders.  This list was suggested to me because of the high amount of
intelligence it boasted, but if I have to sift through so much insecure
name-calling and threats (libel is more evil than condescencion), and I'm
insulted to think that the future thinkers of our world are wrapped in silly
squables.  You say he's picking fights?  You're not doing anything to stop
them.  I already feel used, because this is the third post I have given
today in response to the attacks on David.  Leave it alone and get back to
constructive posting.

By the way, I don't think Ayn Rand is the end-all know-all of productive
transhumanist thought.  Just because someone suggests a book to me doesn't
mean I'm going to read it, and after all, Jocelyn's suggestion that if he
doesn't read those books, he isn't worth taling to, is so completely
insulting and condescending, I think you're yelling at the wrong person...

Those aren't just 'their favorite books' but are also on the Extropians

libertarian around.

How many times does an idiot have to jump off of a building to learn that
gravity makes you fall? If some idiot spews that he thinks it would be a
good idea if everyone jumped off buildings, I would be mighty worried if at
least a couple dozen people on a list of 300 didn't tell him he was an
idiot.

Even on the most rationally open minded mail list, there comes a point where
somethings are commonly accepted to be just stupid, maybe even evil, ideas.
Mr. Musick does not have the luxury of being a newbie to this list. He
resubscribed, even, after knowing for several years exactly what sort of
people subscribe to this list. To me, his affected sense of blissful naivete
and condescention is personally insulting, while his admitted glee in
'pushing other peoples' buttons I find merely rude and obnoxious. If he
actually beleives many of the things he spews here, he is, in fact, IMHO, an
evil person. If he does not beleive those things, but is merely trying to
pick fights and be manipulative, its obvious he needs the shelter of
geographical separation and relative anonymity that the list provides to
protect him from people he would not dare to do these things to in person.
He's likely to get his nose broken if he tried playing his games in real
life.

The idea that Native Americans were devoid of the concept of property rights is a complete and utter falsehood perpetrated by socialist sociologists of the early 20th century (much like the scams about there being no Oedipal complex in Samoan children, and the Maya's being a peaceful communal society that knew how to live with nature). The fact that every treaty that was signed between europeans and native tribes dealt with the disposition of ownership of land indicates that they understood about real estate property rights. Native Americans treated real estate property generall as owned by the tribe, although those that  actively cultivated corn did subdivide land by families. Examples such as the famous trade of Manhattan for beads indicates an understanding of the concept of property (although its also a convoluted concept of the value of property, which is not at issue here). Beyond real estate property, natives very definitely had recognized personal property, from the brave owning captured people from other tribes as slaves, to horses (the main measure of wealth and success in native society), as well as hunting tools, 'camping equipment' etc.

I was simply taking his argument to an absurdum ad nauseum to illustrate its irrationality. He was making personal aspersions. Ok, so I was getting a little ad hominem, but it was simply illustrating my point that he seems to like to do these things because he enjoys the abuse he receives back... very masochistic.

I was wondering if anyone had any information on a new drug I have heard is
being developed for narcoleptics.  I'm mostly curious because it has
interesting effects on non-narcoleptics, in particular 72 hours without the
need for sleep, and then 8 hours of sleep to fully recharge.  Just curious,
and I have mixed feelings on the idea.

On the one hand, I could do so much more if I had 72 consecutive hours in
which to do it.  On the other hand, one of the reasons I love sleeping is
because I get bored with being awake sometimes.  That doesn't sound very
productive, but sometimes you run out of things to do...

For those who are interested, a National Public Radio program called Talk of
the Nation very recently aired a show entitled, "Memes".  Ray Suarez spoke
with Richard Dawkins over the phone, then had a panel discussion with Susan
Blackmore (The Meme Machine) and Robert Wright (The Moral Animal).  Way cool
getting those folks together.  Enjoy at:

Scientists Grapple With Germ Danger

.c The Associated Press

 By LAURAN NEERGAARD

SEATTLE (AP) -- It sounds like science fiction: Microscopic oil droplets 
protect patients from germs and viruses by fusing with the dangerous bugs and 
causing them essentially to explode.

University of Michigan scientists, hunting ways to protect soldiers from 
biological warfare, say they have created just such a drug. It can eradicate 
deadly anthrax within an hour of contact, and promises to be so non-toxic to 
humans that one day it might be possible to decontaminate germ-laden food.

Dr. James Baker, creator of these drug droplets so tiny they have been dubbed 
``nano-bombs,'' added some to a sample of cholera viewed through a microscope.

A few minutes later, ``All that's left here is debris. The remarkable thing 
is this happens almost immediately,'' Baker said.

While still highly experimental, Baker told a biotechnology meeting here 
Wednesday he envisions one day using the nano-bombs not just to treat 
infection, but as protection. They might work as an HIV-blocking vaginal 
cream. Or spray them in your nostrils during flu season and you might not get 
sick.

Baker mixed them to the consistency of skim milk and put them in a standard 
paint sprayer as a way to decontaminate the environment after, say, an 
anthrax threat.

If you add peppermint, he said, ``it actually tastes pretty good.''

Baker's creation is part of a Star Trek-like field of science called 
``nanotechnology,'' creating drugs and other products so minute that 
researchers have to build them one molecule at a time.

Such discoveries have so intrigued the Clinton administration that it just 
listed nanotechnology as a research priority for the next budget, said 
Gregory Milman, director of the National Institutes of Health's Office for 
Innovation.

Joining nanodrugs on the wish list are computer chips capable of storing 
trillions of bits of information on a pin-head and miniature sensors that 
could detect hidden ovarian cancer.

Also Wednesday, researchers said they are designing nanochips to quickly read 
a patient's genes to help pinpoint medical treatment, and ``nanoswitches'' to 
turn off defective genes.

Just how small is nanotechnology? A nanometer is a mere one-billionth of a 
meter. Bacteria and viruses are many times smaller than a human hair, and 
Baker's nano-bombs are hundreds of times smaller than that.

Size is key because it makes the oil droplets ``likely to fuse with bacteria 
while leaving our own cells alone,'' said Baker, whose Defense 
Department-funded research also is important to doctors hunting ways to fight 
the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

The droplets bind to the membrane coating germs or viruses and disrupts that 
coating ``so much that the organism literally explodes,'' explained Baker. He 
said he successfully has killed a host of bacteria and viruses -- even HIV, 
anthrax and smallpox -- in test-tube studies.

Animal tests showed success, too.

Spraying the wounds of mice dying of anthrax reduced mortality by 85 percent. 
Nano-bombs decontaminated environmental anthrax faster than bleach, one of 
just a few chemicals strong enough to kill the spores on contact.

That is important considering growing fear over use of this deadly infection 
by bioterrorists. The nation had 5,000 anthrax threats last year, Baker said.

When people are thought to be exposed, they may be washed down with bleach or 
given antibiotics in an attempt to stave off infection, but doctors -- and 
the Defense Department, worried about biowarfare -- want better protection.

When Baker tried to infect mice with a severe flu strain, those whose noses 
first had been swabbed with the nano-bombs did not get sick. Unprotected mice 
died.

Why would not nano-bombs hurt our cells, too? Most human cells have a 
different coating that seems to keep them from fusing with the droplets, 
Baker said. So far, animals have not shown any sign of harm. But he will have 
to prove safety in lengthy clinical trials before Americans could use such a 
drug.

Baker's first goal is to use nano-bombs as an environmental decontamination 
agent because that takes less testing than the Food and Drug Administration 
requires for a medication.

But his first human drug study, to be conducted at NIH, is planned: using 
nano-bombs as a vaginal cream to try to protect women from the AIDS virus and 
other sexually transmitted diseases.

You guys using Dogpile or other meta-searches might wanna
give metacrawler.com a whirl. I like the way it sifts through
all the results and gives you the most relevant answers instead
of just giving you a list from each one like Dogpile.

OK, here's one I've been wanting to ask someone about.

I love the new Pentium III commercial, the one that shows a
robot being built and walking around to the tune of this
really cool song that I'm just dying to get on CD.  Does
anyone know the name of the song or the artist who sings it?

Do you remember the tune?  It's got a cool guitar riff under
lyrics that go something like this:

"I feel pretty... Oh so pretty... I feel pretty, and witty,
and bright.... and I'll [something]... any girl who comes to
me tonight  [la, la, la, la, la, la la la]

I feel charming... Oh so charming... It's alarming, I'm
charming, and [something, something, something, etc.]"


PLEASE help me out, it's driving me crazy.  Lately I've
found myself flipping around endlessly just to catch that
one commercial.


Chris

P.S. I've teared up at the Cisco ads before, too.  As well
as at the Phillips-Magnavox ads with the "It's getting
better all the time" jingle.  I'm a sap for progess  :)

Hi All,
    Everybody else is putting their $0.02 in, so here goes mine.  The level
of discussion has been both extraordinarily good and terribly monotonous in
different threads.
    The level of interesting technical posts and threads has definitely
picked up recently.  Thank you all for making my dendrites grow!!
    A while ago I thanked Mike Lorrey for running "moron patrol" on the list
in a private email.  Mike was quick to point out that newbies might just
need additional guidance and that I was being intolerant.  He was right on.
Although certain recent posts have added very little to intelligent
discussion, I would hope we can still salvage their ability to add to our
cause (even though the process may be painful).  If they won't take gentle
guidance though, the best course of action is just noncommunication (it is
impossible to debate rationally with a static mind).  More effective though
would be to show the poster the error of his/her ways without antagonizing
them.

I can't agree more with what David Lubkin says:
>See also Heinlein's emphasis on and rationale for manners.

Some thoughts from the master:

"Moving parts in rubbing contact require lubrication to avoid excessive
wear.  Honorifics and formal politeness provide lubrication where people rub
together."

For David Musick:
"Beware of altruism.  It is based on self-deception, the root of all evil."

For Mike Lorrey:
"The correct way to punctuate a sentence that starts: "Of course it is none
my business but ..." is to place a period after the word "but".  Don't use
excessive force in supplying such moron with a period.  Cutting his throat
is only a momentary pleasure and is bound to get you talked about."

(quotes from Time Enough For Love - R. A. Heinlein)

Wryguy,

Our "robot" commercial includes the song  "I Feel Pretty" from Rogers and
Hammerstein's Westside Story.  However, we had our music house re-record the
original song and our version is not available for retail sale.

Umm, sorry, but Rogers and Hammerstein *didn't write* _West Side Story_.

Leonard Bernstein did.

Somebody should tell Intel.

I recently lost a bunch of archived email. Among the last material was one
or more URLs for some interesting Lakoff recent stuff (second generation
cognitive psych, applications to philosophy, etc.). Could someone point me
to them again? Thanks in advance.

You are talking about Provigil, and I started taking it as an
alternative to Ritalin two weeks ago.  What do you want to know?

What happens if you take it more often than once in the morning..
is it really possible to stay usefully awake anywhere near 72
hrs?

Chris:

While, obviously I can not provide you with the cd version of the remake
of the song. I can provide you with the digital format of the commercial.
To which you can play it in real audio and only listen to the song without
having to watch the commercial every time. You can find the commercial along
with the other Intel spots at:

http://www.intel.com/home/PentiumIII/spots

Also, because I _am_ the goddess of commercials. Here is the URL for the
Philips/Magnavox spots!

Enjoy!

PS: You can tell that times have changed. In the original "I feel pretty"
they lyrics were, "I feel pretty and witty and _gay_." I presume they felt
it was better to change the words. Just a cute little aside.

A bit of medline on modafinil (the active substance) below. Overall,
it looks fairly safe, does not affect the hormone system too much,
might worsen hypertension and might make you think that you are more
alert and efficient than you are.

Any bet how quickly use of it for purposes other than narcolepsy will
be classed as narcotics? ;-)


Aviat Space Environ Med 1999 May;70(5):493-8 

Naps and modafinil as countermeasures for the effects of sleep
deprivation on cognitive performance.

Batejat DM, Lagarde DP

Institut De Medecine Aerospatiale du Service De Sante Des Armees,
Bretigny sur Orge, France.

Disruptions in wake-sleep rhythms, particularly induced by sleep
deprivation are limiting factors for military personnel in operations.
The role of sleep and naps in the recovery of performance is generally
accepted. Pharmacological aids, for example hypnotic or stimulant
substances can also be effective countermeasures. Recently, a new
stimulant compound, modafinil (MODIODAL) has also proven
effective. Considering the excellent results obtained with napping and
modafinil, we have studied the combined effect of these two
countermeasures on psychomotor performance under conditions simulating
an operational situation. Beneficial effects of a few hours' nap on
performance were confirmed. Consequently naps should be encouraged,
even if limited and diurnal. Modafinil, which combines wakening and
stimulating properties without any known side effects, was useful for
longer periods of sleep deprivation and when there was no real
possibility of sleep recovery. Modafinil did not prevent sleep if
sleep opportunities were available. The combination of naps and
modafinil demonstrated the best cognitive performance during sleep
deprivation.


Clin Pharmacol Ther 1999 Mar;65(3):328-35 

Does short-term treatment with modafinil affect blood pressure in
patients with obstructive sleep apnea?

Heitmann J, Cassel W, Grote L, Bickel U, Hartlaub U, Penzel T, Peter JH

Department of Medicine, Marburg University,
Germany. heitmanj@mailer.uni-marburg.de

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of modafinil, a central
nonamphetamine awakening substance, on blood pressure and heart rate
in hypersomnolent patients with obstructive sleep apnea. DESIGN: This
double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial was
performed over 2 days and 3 nights in a single-center study of
hospitalized patients from a referred care center.  Twenty-six
otherwise healthy men (age range, 30 to 60 years) with mild to
moderate obstructive sleep apnea were recruited by the outpatient
department of the Marburg University Sleep Laboratory. Patients were
given 200 mg oral modafinil in the morning and 100 mg at
midday. Placebo was given in the same manner in a crossover
design. Mean arterial (radial) blood pressure was monitored
continuously during nocturnal sleep and during a series of
standardized daytime physical and psychologic performance tests.
RESULTS: The difference in the main end point between the treatment
with modafinil and placebo was 1.17+/-0.83 (mean +/- SE) mm Hg (95%
confidence interval: -0.56 to 2.91 mm Hg). The maximal differences in
blood pressure values occurred under loaded conditions (systolic blood
pressure, ergometry: 5.62+/-1.13 mm Hg; mental stress test:
6.19+/-1.33 mm Hg). CONCLUSION: Short-term administration of modafinil
did not elicit a significant response with regard to the main end
point. However, cardiovascular effects during mental and physical load
were observed. Longterm studies that include subjects with
hypertension are necessary to investigate the clinical relevance of
the cardiovascular effects of modafinil.

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending-dose evaluation of the
pharmacokinetics and tolerability of modafinil tablets in healthy male
volunteers.

Grebow PE

Drug Safety and Disposition, Cephalon, Inc., West Chester,

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending-dose study
was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of

administered orally over a 7-day period in normal healthy male
volunteers. Eight subjects (six modafinil; two placebo) were
randomized to each of the four dose groups. Modafinil or a placebo was
administered once daily for 7 days. Serial blood samples were obtained
following administration of the day 1 and day 7 doses for
characterization of pharmacokinetics, and trough samples were obtained
prior to dosing on days 2 through 6 to assess the time to reach the
steady state. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using
noncompartmental methods. Modafinil steady state was reached after
three daily doses. Modafinil pharmacokinetics were dose and time
independent over the range of 200 mg to 800 mg.  Steady-state
pharmacokinetics of modafinil were characterized by a rapid oral
absorption rate, a low plasma clearance of approximately 50 mL/min, a
volume of distribution of approximately 0.8 L/kg, and a long half-life
of approximately 15 hr. Modafinil was primarily eliminated by
metabolism. Modafinil acid was the major urinary
metabolite. Stereospecific pharmacokinetics of modafinil were
demonstrated. The d-modafinil enantiomer was eliminated at a threefold
faster rate than 1-modafinil. Modafinil 200 mg, 400 mg, and 600 mg
doses were generally well tolerated. The modafinil 800 mg dose panel
was discontinued after 3 days of treatment due to the observation of
increased blood pressure and pulse rate. The safety data from this
study suggest that the maximum tolerable single daily oral modafinil
dose, without titration, may be 600 mg.

Effect of modafinil on plasma melatonin, cortisol and growth hormone
rhythms, rectal temperature and performance in healthy subjects during
a 36 h sleep deprivation.

Modafinil is an alerting substance which has been used successfully to
treat narcolepsy. Nothing is known about its effect on hormone
secretions. For this purpose, eight healthy young men were enrolled in
a double blind trial to test the effects of modafinil on daily plasma
melatonin, cortisol and growth hormone (GH) rhythms. Blood was sampled
for hormone assays, every hour during the daytime and every 30 min
during the nighttime. In addition, rectal temperature and mental
performances were determined during the study which comprised 3
sessions, two weeks apart: a 24 h control session including a night
with sleep (S1) and two 48 h sessions S2 and S3 with a sleep-deprived
night (N1) followed by a recovery night (N2). Modafinil (300 mg x 2)
or placebo were randomly attributed during N1 at 22 h and 8 h. As
expected, performance was improved after modafinil administration and
body temperature was maintained or increased. Plasma melatonin and
cortisol profiles were similar after modafinil and placebo
administration. The levels observed during the recovery and the
control nights (N2) displayed no difference. For GH, during both sleep
deprived nights, secretion was dramatically reduced compared with the
control one, although the number of secretory episodes was unchanged.
These data show that the alerting property of modafinil is not related
to an alteration of hormone profiles and suggest that the acute
modafinil administration is devoid of short-term side-effects.

Self-monitoring cognitive performance during sleep deprivation: effects of
modafinil, d-amphetamine and placebo.

Self-monitoring refers to the ability to assess accurately one's own
performance in a specific environment. The present study investigated
the effects of the stimulating drugs modafinil (300 mg) and
d-amphetamine (20 mg) on the ability to self-monitor cognitive
performance during 64 h of sleep deprivation (SD) and sustained mental
work. Two cognitive tasks were investigated: a visual (perceptual)
judgement task and a complex mental addition task. Subjects in the
placebo condition displayed marked circadian and SD effects on
cognitive task performance but their self-monitoring was substantively
undisturbed by SD. Subjects performing under the influence of
d-amphetamine likewise displayed highly proficient self-monitoring
throughout the SD period. In contrast, modafinil had a disruptive
effect on self-monitoring, inducing a reliable 'overconfidence' effect
(i.e. an overestimation of actual cognitive performance), which was
particularly marked 2-4 h post-dose. Although modafinil has proven to
be a safe and effective countermeasure to the effects of extensive SD
on cognitive task performance, we encourage a more comprehensive
understanding of the relation between its subjective and performance
enhancing effects before the drug is recommended as a viable fatigue
countermeasure.

Hi Everyone:

Yeah, Mike, Leonard Bernstein wrote the music and Peter(?) SONDHEIM wrote 
the "book," i.e., the storyline, to "WESTSIDE STORY."

Dear Chris:

The new Pentium III robot song is a variation on a song (I think it's called 
"I Feel Pretty," but I'm not sure) from, of all places, the musical 
"WESTSIDE STORY."  It's sung by Maria as she's getting ready for her first 
date with Tony.  Various (soundtrack) versions are available on CD.  And as 
a bonus, you'll also get the great romantic songs "Tonight," and "Maria" to 
boot.

Best Regards,

MCP

Now I understand what Mike Lorrey is so upset about.  I believe that the 
concept of "Property Rights" is a fictional concept, more of a social 
convention than something that exists whether we like it or not.  Mike 
Lorrey believes that Property Rights exist whether we like it or not because 
of Natural Law.  Because our difference of opinion, he considers me "evil" 
and seeks to demonize my opinions and get me to stop discussing them on this 
list as quickly as possible.  Sounds like a good basis for a rational 
discussion...


     Related Philosophical Discusion:
As far as I can tell, all my concepts about the world are "fictional", in 
the sense that I made them up as a convenient way of organizing my 
experiences.  I believe all concepts are essentially fictional for the same 
reason.  We just made them up.  Yes, they are convenient and they do help us 
acheive goals, but they are essentially mind tricks.  Believing in one's own 
concepts too firmly is a form of delusional thinking (believing that one's 
ideas about the world are more real than the world itself).  My basic 
reality is one of experience, not of concepts (actually, concepts are a form 
of mental experience to me).


I assert that the concept of property rights is a fictional concept, and I 
have backed up my assertion with the argument that all concepts are 
essentially fictional.  I ask those who believe it is not a fictional 
concept to back up their positions, and since the position is that "Property 
Rights" exists independently of human thought, they must cite emperical 
evidence which supports the existence of "Property Rights".  In other words, 
what evidence can we see around us that demonstrates that "Property Rights" 
exists?

I say "Property Rights" is a social convention, Mike Lorrey says it is 
Natural Law.  I would appreciate it if Mike Lorrey would explain the concept 
of "Natural Law" to us, so we are clear on his meaning.  However, I suspect 
it is essentially another fictional concept which Mike Lorrey finds 
convenient to justify his political views.  Perhaps he can convince me 
otherwise. (and then I can have his "evil" label removed from me)

Thank you for your attention,

David_Musick@juno.com

our concepts about the world are not the world itself

WHAT'S HUSHMAIL?

Speak freely with Hushmail!

Much more than webmail! Much more than SSL! HushMail uses java applet
technology to bring a full-featured public-key cryptosystem right into your
browser. What does that mean to you? Total privacy! Absolutely no-one but
you can read your messages!

HushMail is the world's Þrst, fully encrypted, truly secure, free web-based
e-mail client. Our patent pending, state-of-the-art technology keeps
private communication private. Free and easy to use, It works just like
other web-based email providers, except Hushmail offers the ultimate in
security and privacy.

Signing on is simple. Just click on "GET AN ACCOUNT" and you'll be asked
for your username and some basic demographic information. Jiggle your mouse
to generate a random set of keys and you're ready to go. It's that simple.
Hushmail requires no special software or conÞguration. The whole
registration process can take less than 2 minutes.

And with Hushmail you get the following beneÞts:

It's completely free.

It's easy to use.

And it's the only service that offers fully encrypted, truly secure,
completely private e-mail.

HushMail uses a patent-pending process called "public key cryptosystem with
roaming user capability." That means that the only people who can read your
mail are the people that you send it to. And it also mean that you can
access your account from any computer that has a web browser and internet
access, anywhere in the world.

It's your choice.

Before Hushmail, you didn't have an easy option for complete security and
privacy in your web-based email communications. It just didn't exist. The
ineffective encryption measures used by other email service providers just
don't measure up to the patent pending, state-of-the-art security provided
by Hushmail. And our easy-to-use interface means that you don't have to
change the way you are used to using email.

So now that you have a choice between secure and private communications or
unsecured communications, we hope you'll choose security and privacy. In
short, we hope you choose Hushmail.

I've signed up for it: retroman@hushmail.com

I just wish it was set up as something I could run on my own machine and not have to go to their website.

I agree with all comments on pro-extropic commercials mentioned. I personally prefer the spots the Sci-Fi channel is running where the characters are saying they want this and that other thing or ability that are all extropic/transhuman concepts, though the Phillips Magnavox and the "I Am." commercials come a close second. Who says corporations don't benefit society? I think the memetic injections these commercials are putting into society are of enormous benefit.

First off, I can blow out of the water his claim that 'all concepts are essentially fictional'. There are many concepts describing the behavior of the universe. The universe and its behavior is not fictional.

Concepts that are not 'fictional' but based on accurate observation of the real world:
- The Big Bang
- Evolution
- Newtons Laws
- Relativity
- Quantum Mechanics
- All Mathematics
- Chemical and Atomic Physics
That we attach made up words to describe these real phenomena is irrelevant because the phenomena exist externally to our ability to label and observe them.

The primary source of Natural Law for humankind is the process of Natural Selection we call Evolution. Those behaviors or cultural constructs which optimize the survival of the species and the happiness of the average individual ( a key component of the individual's ability to survive and reproduce  ) are behaviors and cultural constructs which are what is known as Natural Law. While the more classical, pre-scientific concepts of Natural Law merely ascribed the source to be The Creator, because anything that was good and aided the survival and happiness of mankind was 'obviously' ordained by 'God', our increased knowledge of the universe allows us to better understand the source of those behaviors and cultural contsructs which are most beneficial to the happiness and survival of the species.

Property Rights are a part of Natural Law because of the observed optimum happiness and survivability the concept lends to individuals, families, and large groups of people. It limits conflicts by communicating clearly what belongs to who, as conflict is the result of confusion or incomplete information about some issue that two or more parties have a property related interest in. It ensures that an individual, family or group of individuals can rely on the resources that the Property Rights define for their survival, and the ownership the Rights denote on the posessor of the property instills a sense of responsibility and stewardship in the owner for the property, such that the property is more likely to be cared for and maintained for maximum benefit and productivity.

Natural Law as a group of concepts that recognise rights originating in the individual have been recognised for thousands of years. We see such recognition in the words of Aristotle, in Confucius, in Isis and Osiris, and in Quetzalcoatl. That such concepts can evolve in civilizations so geographically and temporally separated indicates that the concepts are an obvious, natural consequence of evolved human behavior. Contrary to the claims of socialists everywhere, I will state that there never has been and never will be a society that does not recognise Property Rights in some form.

Additionally, by looking at the survivability/stability/ and longevity of societies, we can infer that Property Rights originate most naturally in the individual. The Soviet State, for example, that recognised no property rights outside ones personal clothing, implements or tools, etc. lasted a mere 70 years, while european civilization, both in europe, the New World, and in Australia/NZ, have exhibited the greatedest survivability, vitality, and general and individual happiness and well being in history. The Chinese experiment with communism lasted a mere 35-40 years, and has now become a mercantilist totalitarian society, providing the people the illusion of rights (including property rights) so long as it suits the ruling regieme. The US, where property rights can be safely stated to be the most individualized and protected of any nation, has acheived a level of prosperity and advancement unmatched. Other smaller nations which have acheived similar levels of advancement also have highly developed codes protecting property rights.

While the above statement may seem gingoistic to some, lets look further back in history. The Roman Republic, for example, was at the time the most organized and at the same time the most libertarian society around. The concepts of Natural Law as elucidated by Aristotle and other Greeks were worshipped by the Romans. Because of this, Rome was able to acheive a level of greatness unmatched to that point in history. As soon as the Republic was abdicated and the Empire instituted, however, the seeds of the end of the Roman civlization were sown.

Given all of this, I feel I can safely conclude that Property Rights are an abstraction of Natural Selection that benefits the evolution of the human race far more than the lack of such rights. If Mr. Musick is to continue to claim that Property Rights are 'fictional concepts' he must prove that evolution and the physical laws that make evolution possible are  fictional concepts.

Thank you, Michael for your well-written reply.  I agree with you that  the 
concept of property rights can be derived quite easily from the goals of 
maximizing the survivability and happiness of the human species.

However, just because a concept or theory is based on thousands of years of 
accurate observation, it doesn't make it any less a human mental construct.  
I'm not saying that such theories and concepts are not extremely useful; I'm 
only reminding us that humans formulated these concepts and theories 
originally (they were not some "absolute truth" given to us from God).

We experience sensory data, and we notice consistent patterns in that data.  
Our theories and concepts are based on the consistent patterns we notice.  I 
prefer to remember that my experience is my primary reality and my concepts 
and theories about my reality (no matter how well they seem to fit my 
experience) are essentially mental experiences.  Believing that these mental 
experiences are some sort of "absolute truth" seems less than honest to me.

So, Michael, I hope you understand why I cannot accept the concept of 
property rights as an "absolute truth", but must see it as essentially a 
useful fiction.  I agree with you that a respect for "Property Rights" is an 
excellent way to run a civilization.  I also believe that the same effect 
would arise if people simply respected one another (persuading them to do 
that is the challenge I would like to see more people working on).

David_Musick@hotmail.com

our knowledge may be increasingly accurate,
but it is never absolutely true.

David,
    Why you being vilified is because you are taking up a discussion which
has already been debated on the list many times before. The arguments you
are using are extremely thin and don't make much sense in terms of the real
world.
    The concept of property rights extends all the way to your very person.
Without property rights you create a very slippery slope which leads the way
to communism (i.e. all your possesions including yourself belong to the
collective)  All of our concepts of physical being are tied to the right to
possess things.  The concept of physical reality may indeed be an illusion
("There is no spoon") but it is the only set of rules which we currently
have to operate by.  Using another set of rules to operate by is often
referred to as insanity or mysticism.
    In the modern world we operate on material goods (matter) and
information.  We act as individuals or organizations on that matter and
information.  If you take away the right of individuals or organizations to
act on that matter indepently and for their own benefit, you seriously
impede technolgical progress (making all matter available to everybody at
the same time would be chaos).  As we progress through the nanotech
revolution there will be less emphasis on matter and more on information,
but you can't do away with property rights completely until you have
technolgies such as nucleonic scale engineering and matter-energy-matter
conversion, and the value of a specific piece of matter becomes negligible.
    The concept of natural law is well established in modern philosophy and
referrences can be found quite easily through the web.

This is your primary error that you continue to espouse. I make no claims for any god. You agree with my statements that Natural Law is well established as a codification of thousands of years of accurate observations of what is beneficial for humanity, yet you refuse to acknowledge that these observations are experimental and experiential confirmation that Natural Law as a concept is an inherent substrate of the reality of this universe, or you are denying that this universe is real. Either assumption on your part is irrational and illogical. If you continue to insist on these assumptions, please prove your point as I have done.

You are fallaciously mixing hard science and soft (human) science, 
as well as throwing history in (which is no kind of science 
whatsoever), and being defensive about it because even you know 
that you are doing it.  I am a believer in private property rights; 
however I am intellectually honest enough with myself and others 
to admit that it is a belief of mine rather than an item of scientific 
knowledge.  Please strive to be this honest yourself.  You believe 
in the abolition of government, but by your own historical argument 
(which you use to justify property rights), government is an 
evolution of Natural Law, having been with us for countless 
millennia.  Consistency counts; please try to demonstrate some of 
it.

Strange. Personally I find that ad very weak, and not just because it
sells a mediocre product from our favourite monopoly. The 'Intel'

To use any part of the history of european and native american relations as
an element to support legal legitimacy or property rights, is more than a
bit of a stretch.  

We Americans have been brought up in a culture where public education uses
the euphemism "western colonialism" to sanitize the historical record of
the western European juggernaut of military conquest, subjugation, and mass
murder.  

The treaties of which you speak were drawn up by the europeans and employed
to give documentary legitimacy to territorial acquistion accomplished
through the use of superior military technology.  The documents thus signed
were little understood by the defeated parties and, in any event, were
signed under conditions of the most extreme duress imaginable.  These facts
are more applicable to subjects such as corrupt historical scholorship, the
brutality of realpolitik, and the morally perverse employment of legalistic
instrumentalities, than to any discussion of legal legitimacy and property
rights.  Bad form that, at best. 









(In the new Star Wars movie the evil-emperor-to-be tells his military
proxies to proceed with the invasion. When challenged about the legality of
this course of action he says, "I will make it legal."  Whereupon he
instructs the proxies to capture the queen and force her to sign a treaty.)

The disparity between work units sent and results received indicates
that the joins have not saturated yet. Somehow, I think the creators
of the project have never anticipated such a resonance ;)

Though it is difficult to imagine a project more motivating to the
public than SETI an ALife project akin to 
http://www.hip.atr.co.jp/~ray/tierra/netreport/netreport.html
could come close, especially if providing stunning visuals.

As the rollout of xDSL continues, the local density of potential project
participants connected with low-latency ~1 Mbps might become
supercritical for really worthwhile projects. JITed Java performance
is apparently at the threshold of becoming comparable to true compiled
languages. Creating a distributed GA for the sake of finding a mutation
function capable of mutating Java VM opcodes robustly would be
obviously extremely worthile. Searches of integer 3d CA rule space would
be that as well, and simultaneously guarantee a rich source of visuals.

Of course one could also think about writing a code GA searching for
constructive IP stack buffer overruns, and applying just-discovered
exploits immediately... >;)

I don't know if you could stay up 72 hours on it or not, but it seems
reasonable.

I take two 100mg tablets in the morning and it lasts through the day.
Taking additional tablets later simply extends the effect.  With
Ritalin, you do feel when it starts having effect, and you can feel
when it is wearing off (the Ritalin works typically 4 hours at a
time.)  With the Provigil you don't really feel it per se, you just
don't feel sleepy.  A colleague at work contacted our pharmacy while
on speakerphone to ask how it works - it apparently works on dopamine
receptor sites blocking reuptake, and on "alpha"(?) (I didn't make out
all of the second part, though :-(  It has yet to make the PDR, but is
documented on the pharmacy formulary info subscriptions.  Your local
pharmacist could get you more detailed info on the actions,
contraindications, possible side effects etc.

The listed potential side effects included euphoria, headaches,
irritability, difficulty sleeping (duh!).  It is quite expensive
though.  Without a health plan a months supply was about $250.  Unlike
Ritalin and the amphetamines it is not Schedule II, so those
limitations don't apply (schedule II require you to fill the
prescription within 72 hours, must be issued in duplicate, cannot
include refills, must reference the diagnosis, must include a street
address, can only be a 30 day supply.)

Could perhaps the absence of property rights offer certain (few?) 
individuals, such as Mr. Musick, an evolutionary advantage?

That seems a better than average radio interview- Kova obviously did
her homework and knew the right questions to ask you.  A refreshing
change from the typical dim journalist.

As for the points you make in the interview, well, I've thought
along those lines for so long that none of it surprises me.  Rather
amusing that drastic change can be boring if you're anticipating
it...

This is primarily directed to Michael -

I think we agree on this issue.  But I'll need clarification from you to see if we differ in any way.  Like you, I happen to like property rights.  I also happen to like all of the rights listed under the 'Bill of Rights'.  Yet one must ask, do I need a 'right' granted to me by some document or govermental agency?  The use of the word "right" seems to imply that it's a privalege which can be revoked.  I see my capacity for free thought and speech, not so much as right granted to me, but as an intrinsic part of my existence.  My understanding of your argument is that you see property rights in the same context?  Is this correct?  My point is that my intrinsic capacity for freedom is as real as one can get.  If we insist on calling it a fiction, then we might as well call everything fiction - and any distinction between the two becomes meaningless.

To conclude, the feeling in my bones is real.  The 'right' to feel it granted by a government is a fiction.  That being said, I would say any 'right' is a fiction.  My 'right' to free speech is a fiction, and so are property 'rights'.  I don't need some 'right' written down by goverments and/or power elites telling me what I already feel in my bones.

I look forward to your response.

I'm a newbie, and I strongly suspect I should not post on this topic.

However, there are some apparent contradictions between extropian and
libertarian philosophies, at least as I understand them, and I have read
the reading list.

Also, I might be a pretty rare bird, since I espoused objectivist and
libertarian principles for almost twenty years, and I now  believe I have
reasonable arguments and evidence against some extreme claims of both
objectivists and anarcho-syndicalist libertarians.  I would be interested
to see if these reasons make sense to any of you.

Should I stay out of this?  I have no interest in boring or inflaming the
list members.

It would also be subject to the prejudices of the consortium.
Why not let scientists and philosophers own the principles they discover,
and license them for use?  This gives researchers access to all kinds of
funding.  It also focuses research on human needs.  Finally, it reduces
the significance of credentials.

There might well be duplication of effort, but if disclosure were
required for licensing,
(like it is for patenting), openness would not be a problem.

Or, what about the British Air commercial?  There's one where people form
a big
eye on the ground whil a small choir oohs in lovely harmony.
I was debugging the software for an in-flight entertainment system, and
that was our test tape.  I got so I had to turn down the volume to get
any work done.  (I wasn't annoyed, just so blasted by the vocal and
visual beauty that I couldn't keep my mind
on the code.)

In translation systems there's this idea called a bridge language. 
Basically, one avoids a combinatorial explosion of translators by
translating everything to and
from the bridge language.  So, if there are 4 languages (or transhumans)
with a bridging system there would be 4 translation systems, rather than
6, with 100 transhumans, there would be 100, rather than 9,900, etc.

The optimal bridge language would be historical, so archiving would be
easy.
It would have a well-uinderstood grammar.  It should be culturally
neutral, and
since we're gonna-be transhuman, we want  to say smart things, so we want
it  to be expressive.

Now at this point, there are three or four classic choices:
English, French, Esperanto, and Loglan.

English is good historically, but smacks of cultural imperialism to some
people, and
could have a better grammar.  Spelling is grotesque.  Expressivity is,
well, ok.

French has a wonderful history and  grammar, (controlled by the Institute
Francaise), but, as it happens, I don't like it, even though I can read
it.  For me, of course, this is conclusive. ;)

Esperanto is a good contender, and the EU automated translation
facilities use it as a culturally-neutral bridge language.  It's also
easy to learn: Even a linguistically lazy (or impaired) person like me
could learn it in a less than a year.  I had one friend who learned it in
a weekend (grr!)  Also, if I don't propose this, I may be drawn and
quartered by Esperantists, who are, well, sometimes a little -militant-
about the language.  The cultural icon for Esperantism is a green star,
by the way.

-Loglan was invented to test the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis that people can
think better in a language that better expresses logic.  IMHO Loglan is
the most perfectly expressive spoken language ever designed.  Not the
best, just the most flexible, logical and unambiguous.  It has a unique
humorous art: One can actually say absurdities such as  "John is a short
word."  That is, John, -the person-, is a short word.  Also, one can
gleefully confuse nouns and verbs, which don't exist as such in the
language.  It should therefore be great for bureaucratese, (which of
course is likely to be one of the first applications of transhuman
intelligence, if the government funds the experiments.)

1. it contains compoundable regular grammars for almost all common human
grammatic features in human languages, as well as all standard symbolic
logic. (e.g. quantifiers, conjunctions, time tenses, location tenses,
(absent in Indo-european languages, but common in american-indian
languages), complex modals like should, would,  etc, etc. etc.,)

2. It makes minimal ontological assumptions (for example, time-tenses are
optional, unlike in English, and word-roles are -modifiable- unlike any
other language of which I've heard),

3. it is maximally recognizable: loglan 'predicates' are picked for
maximum recognizability in the five languages with the most speakers,
(e.g. "blanu" = "x is bluer than y" is a mixture of English "blue",
chinese "lan",  etc), 

4. It is culturally neutral, since it's all made up.

5. It is phonemically disambiguated. vowel-consonant order is in regular
patterns
that always fall into words even when the words are spoken without a
pause.

6. It is grammatically disambiguated.  They used YACC (yet another
compiler compiler, a UNIX utility for making machine parsers)  to find
problems.

7. It is perfectly regular, which increases learnability, and decreases
effort.

I love loglan, I wouldn't mind Esperanto or English.  If I had to, I'd
use French.
But hey, as transhumans, we could probably learn all four in a trice,
right?  Why
not add Mandarin, as well, and get access to the largest language block,
and an ancient history, as well?

The big advantage of ufog is that it provides many of the advantages of
nanotech while exposing one to fewer hazards than a solution in which
general-purpose assemblers are ubiquitous.

However, it also looks like ufog is pretty hazardous by itself.  Think of
the lung disease that could be caused by misprogrammed ufog.

Also, the value would then shift from the material to the intellectual
property, right?
Intellectual property however, can be cheap.

There's a wonderful book on human temperament, "Please Understand Me"
It describes current scientific results of personality profiling, and
includes
a simple self-administered personality test.

I mention this because most of the people attracted to science and math
seem to
be the exact opposite of shallow.  They tend to be extremely driven by
intuition,
not sensory experiences.  In general such people tend to figure things
out
from first principles, and to be fond of deep chains of logic and
causation.

I don't think sensory equipment has anything to do with temperament.  I
think brain structure probably has a lot to do with it, though.

Maybe one reason why we all seem to like these advertisements is that
they try to move us, and especially move us with strong *positive*
emotions. Very little of contemporary art tries to do that these days. 

(Of course, I'm trying to rectify that with a small exhibition of my
renderings in time for TransVision 99. Coming soon to a net near
you...)

It is often easier to rely on finished products than having the
production system itself (only DIY people, survivalists and
programmers disagree :-).

The problem seems to be that it is impossible to test very complex
systems for all possible contingencies, and this will likely cause
trouble when designing ufog. How do you convince the customers it is
perfectly safe? 

You get the same problem with AI: what testing would be required
before an AI program was allowed to completely run a nuclear power
plant? Most likely a lot, and even then I guess insurance premiums
would go up and if somethind did go wrong people would be sued to
hell. But having humans is allright, as long as they have had a
certain education and passed certain less stringent tests.

There is an article that may interest the list "Cloning the Bodybuilder" in
issue #15 of MaxMuscle. So far their WEB page has only issue #14 on it but
it may be updated soon. 

WEB Page

http://www.maxmuscle.com/magazine/default.htm

You could probably pick up a paper copy of one of their stores now. I picked
up the copy I have at NPC California State Bodybuilding & Fitness event
yesterday.

Thanks for all that info on the robot commercial for Intel.
Now I can finally put my itching curiosity to rest on that
score.

Anyway it's a great groove, even for a cover of a showtune.
To the Intel Info-droid: if they ever decide to release the
full version, please let me know.

To Mike Lorrey: I agree, the flow of commercials like the
ones we are discussing amount to a steady attitude massage
for the masses; subtle memetic manipulation that will
eventually convert a technophobic populace into willing
participants in the transhuman condition.  'Tis a gentle
seduction, indeed  :)

So long as the ends of transhumanism continue to overlap
with those of corporations like Intel, Cisco and the rest,
we'll all be able to watch comfortably from our balconies,
doing relatively little as the predictable tides of the
global economy wash us up on the shores of a singularity or
two.

A comforting thought, and probably mostly accurate.

I'd go farther - the commercials play to already existing positive
feelings about technology.  There is a study done every year where they
ask college students various questions, one of which is, "What's cool
right now?"  Last year, for the first time, "beer" didn't win - the
internet did.

Technophilia is by no means a universal sentiment, but we shouldn't
underestimate it.

On the contrary, my anti-government stance is also supported by my
argument, since it is demonstrated that "that government governs best
which governs least". The least possible government is none at all. I
cannot get any more consistent than that.

Failure to insist upon the Natural source of individual human rights is
the loophole through which all totalitarians are able to cloud the minds
and hearts of humanity so that the people conduct the evils crimes of
history for their opressors. If we do not insist upon our rights'
Natural origins, then they are in fact merely fictions which rely purely
upon the unjustified force we wish to bring to bear to force others to
accept our version of reality. I need force no one when I stand upon my
own two feet and insist upon my natural rights. They may kill me, but
they will not enslave me. You must love your freedom more than your
life. Evil prospers upon the acquiescent surrender of the courage of the
individual.

Moreover, your separation of hard and soft sciences is another
rhetorical wedge used to divide the houses of knowledge to serve the
purposes of the ignorant. The difference between hard and soft sciences
is far more a matter of a spectrum of increasing abstraction from the
root laws of the universe. This view of science is the sort of benefit
that the trend toward consilience aids in. My own distain for many in
the soft sciences has to do with how easily many of their practitioners
are swayed to the 'dark side', and not with the sciences themselves.

I see you have never read the constitution of the Iroquois
Confederation, which predates european settlement, and which explicitly
recognises property rights.

While the revisionist socialists exaggerate by far the differential in
military capacity between european infantry and natives to make the
europeans look ever the bully.

On the contrary, a bow and arrow was a far superior weapon to the brown
bess musket (or any muzzle loading gun) during the colonial period, and
on frequent occasions, native americans owned superior firearms in a
face off with US military, because of the slowness with which the
military procurement process worked. Custer's last stand, for example,
occured because the natives were armed with lever action repeating
rifles, while the cavalry was armed with muzzel loading horse pistols
and single shot bolt action rifles.

Natives usually never had any opposition to signing treaties. What they
objected to was the continuous violation of those treaties by white
settlers. When they did object to treaties it was because of this lack
of credibility of the whites. The US Cavalry was originally set up in
the western territories to enforce the treaties upon both the natives
and the white settlers.

Speaking of currupt historical scholarship. Using the plot of a science
fiction movie written by liberal revisionists from Hollywood in an
argument on past history is the height of corrupt scholarship.

First off, please stop hiding behind other identities. An honest
debating opponent does not hide behind shrouds of anonymity, unless they
have ulterior motives.

Making property rights for individuals non-existent would allow
socialists and socialist sympathisers to seize upon any property or
resource under the claim that it is for 'the common good'. They could
gain great personal wealth for themselves hidden by a socialist
authority and may reproduce by large quantities, however, the resultant
losses in economic growth due to stifled invention, public morale, and
personal enmity of all freedome loving persons for such oppressors will
eventually bring about instability and revolution, which frequently
(according to the mortality statistics for political leaders) will
result in their deaths and the deaths of their families. While there may
be a short term advantage, there is no long term advantage, which is
what evolution lends greater weight to.

To true.

It is not the sciences that are soft, it is the people in them.

Psychology is a science, period. But most people in psychology departments
see science as an intrinsically misogynistic arm of capitalism which must
constantly be guarded against lest it get "out of control" - imagine - too
much science: how terrible.

Hence student essays which begin "x (intelligence, personality ... ) cannot
be universally defined, ever."  And conclude that the writer is therefore
going to continue believing whatever he/she likes in this area: be it Freud
or EMDR.

Of course physics and biology are every bit as "soft". Just see how soft
people make it when it gets in the way of their religion (hubble and the big
bang theories), mystical persuasion (quantum mechanics), or political
beliefs (nuclear power, green house gases).

best,
tim

I'm finding the ongoing discussion of Natural Law on this list
facinating - not really for the content, but for the location. It seems
that Natural Law has become (to some) a justification of private
property rights because it is "Natural", it pertains in some way to
"evolution", and it is simply the best system that we can come up with,
tried and true, etc...

Humanity has naturally evolved into its present form over billions of
years, but none of us are particularly happy with the current form (a
fair job, good ideas, seems to die rather to frequently, please pay more
attention to neatness, final mark 6/10). Evolution is the antithesis of
the transhuman, one would think. The whole idea of transhumanism seems
to me to be about breaking the evolutionary shackles and reinventing our
universe as we see fit.

Why not break another shackle?

Parsing this as a question of who originated the song... I do believe it
was Lennon & McCartney. Not sure if the ad uses the Beatles or a cover
band--I killed my TV (well, my cable feed) over a decade ago, so my TV ad
exposure is rather low.

The Bill of Rights is not meant to  be a grant from the government, but
a statement by the people recognizing that they feel 'it in their
bones', and that any government which pledges allegiance to the
Constitution must acknowledge its subservience to this will of the
people. Because of this, the Bill of Rights is a hedge against
government, and not a grant to the people by government. This is the
essential difference between the US style of government and most other
supposedly 'democratic' governments. Most governments that claim to be
democratic are more accurately described as elected dictatorships (any
parliamentary system), and they all reseve original sovereign power to
the government rather than too the people as we do.

This is why the US Constitution is a Natural Rights document. Its
existence merely ensures that all loyal citizens be duty bound to
protect the natural rights of all individuals, to back up the principles
of Natural Rights with force when faced with opposition from those who
only recognise the Force Doctrine.

I had always thought that Bernstein wrote the music & lyrics, and Sondheim
was the guy who wrote the dialog. But I don't know how I got that
impression (unless it was from Bernstein hogging the credit somehow). 

I am sure any sheet music store (and very likely a video rental) could fix
me right up with an answer, but 'tis not a high priority for me and not a
really relevant thread for EXI. :)

No-one will mind if you express these views (snicker snicker). Really,
the members of this list are slow to anger (ha, *snort*), and don't hold
the kinds of strong opinions which could lead to inflamation (guffaw, no
, no, please stop).

I for one would say, wade right in, go crazy. No one will be influenced
by any argument on this subject, as recent history shows, but this is no
reason to back off.

To become a full player in this all-in-brawl, just put "Re: Property
Rights" in the subject line of your message.

I don't think its going to be all that difficult to convince customers
that these things are safe particularly - ufog sounds like the
consumer's dream, and its incredible appeal as the ultimate in consumer
durables must outstrip fear of its danger (even if that fear is well
founded). Is ufog more dangerous than a car? Than having guns around the
house? Than having cleaning products in your laundry?

What's the benefit of running a nuclear power plant with an AI. Cheaper
power? If it is, it'll turn up somewhere with low restrictions (eastern
europe?) and either work well for a long enough time to convince the
world of its safety, or some power stations will blow up and the whole
thing will take a bit longer. It'll  get there eventually though. The
space shuttle is flying again, after all.

Meanwhile, Homer keeps his job.

Any good engineer knows that it is far easier to work with the forces
involved rather than try to combat them. Opposing natural forces is a
stressful, unstable, temporary thing. This is why free market capitalism
works best, it doesn't try to fight human nature, but it tries to take
advantage of it to fullfill all needs (including altruistic ones).

We are learning with computing that evolved systems are capable of
becoming the most powerful systems ever, far beyond the capabilities of
targeted purposeful design.

Extropy is not anti-evolution, but for enhanced evolution.

I clicked this link before I read the whole e-mail, and looked about for
the cloning stuff, wondering vaguely if this was the new Extropians home
page, and who Max Muscle is (some kind of Power)?

Wasn't it Lyle who wanted to be an unreasonably healthy bodybuilder in

Actually, that's quite interesting. Enhanced evolution, yes, I can go
with that (although as an interested observer, since evolution from the
individual's perspective is all about being squashed like a bug, just
ask a bug).

My only problem with evolution is that it needs individual failure to
work. I'm not really interested in failing (lethaly) for the good of the
group, so I'm hoping there's a better way for humanity to move forward.

I would make the statement that the forms of capitalism currently
practised in the world are not perfect. I hope others would agree. That
is not to say that they are necessarily fataly flawed. Just imperfect.

Then the concept of enhanced evolution, when applied to the market (as
it would need to be, given imperfection), implies a path to "perfection"
littered with the corpses of the "failures".

>From the viewpoint of a long (infinitely long?) lived individual, there
is a big flaw in the idea of a competitive system. The flaw is that we
are all doomed to failure. If the probability of failure for us is
greater than zero in an evolutionary "trial", then it must approach 1
over time, as the number of trials increases. And the probability of
failure in a trial must be greater than zero, if just to account for
forces out of individual control.

In my own individual, greedy, selfish way I think that this individual,
greedy, selfish economic system is a bum-deal, because it dooms me to
eventual (multiple) failure. If that failure can be fatal (and it can),
then I'm really worried.

Hey, maybe we could cooperate. Oops, I've been watching too much Sesame
Street.

Oh, people would believe that these things are safe. People will just
about believe anything if it gives them an apparent local-minimum
advantage. People can't help it, since they're built this way. And
because majority rules we'll be always in trouble.

Of course these things won't be safe, even if there was no
autoreplicator capability built-in. No man-made computers are provably 
secure, and hacked nanofoglets make great arms or bootstrap tools
for creating true autoreplicators. Positional control is what we are
lacking, and there is no utility fog without advanced positional control.

(However, I honestly believe no utility fog will be ever built, since
we either screw us up first *real tight*, or evolve beyond the
necessety of needing utility fog at all before we have a chance of
building it. If you can work with electronically excited states 
and photons, why on earth would you want to drag atoms around?
(Disclaimer: system maintenance and coevolutionary artefacts excluding)).

But nowhere do you find no government, just like nowhere do you 
find a complete lack of private property.  "That government governs 
best which governs least" is no less of a mantric slogan that "From 
each according to his ability; to each according to his need".  Just 
because someone once said it does not entail its necessity.

Nature grants no rights; People grant them to each other or take 
them for themselves, or a combination of the two.  A hurricane, 
lightning bolt, earthquake, tornado, tsunami or any other act of 
nature cares not one whit about your assertion of "natural rights".  
The two words juxtaposed form a contradiction in terms.  What is 
natural is what obtains prior to any country, society, civilization, or 
culture; the Darwinian Law of Survival of the Fittest For Their Niche 
and the rest be damned by the scythe of Natural selection.  The 
"State of Nature" preceding mutually agreed upon norms of  
acceptable conduct was nasty, brutish and short.

That, according to Hegel, was what originally separated the slave

become weak incapable parasites ripe for revolution (to pursue 
Hegel's master-slave dialectic further).  One who is willing to die for

It takes courage to kill other people, whether your motives are

good or evil results (three different things).  It would be nice if we 
could equate evil and cowardice, but this we cannot do, for there 
have always been the courageous evil and the cowardly good 
among us.

There may indeed be isomorphisms of pattern, but they are not

Science is a matter of fact and is value neutral, Darth (duh!); the 
purposes to which we put what we discover and the intent which 
motivates us is where ethics come in.  Physical science and 
axiology are not equivalent or even equivocable disciplines; one 
may be applied to the use of the products of the other, but they DO 
NOT either CROSS-DERIVE or MUTUALLY GROUND.  End of

I program medical and avionic systems, and the general criteria are
pretty straight-forward.
You test the thing for designed behavior, and then you test it for
environmental
benignity (e.g. operating-room equipment has saline solution pured on it,
and
stell rods poked into open orfices, and various shorts on teh pweor plug)

>You get the same problem with AI: what testing would be required

>plant?
Well, speaking as a professional safety engineer, I think this would be
an easy
argument.  Just test the program with the same simulation used to train
the
human operator.  If it does ok, then it's ok.

However, most regulatory environments require that no single fault should
be able to induce a harmful failure (this is simple common sense,
really).
Therefore, one might have a much easier time with certification
 if there was a second AI, with a different design, to second-guess or
cooperate with the first.  This makes the system far less prone to fail
the first time an AI makes
a mistake,  And, it _will_, right?

Two list members expressed interest, so here goes.  I'm sorry that it's
long.

Why I am not an anarcho-syndicalist libertarian:
I do not know of a solution to the free-rider problem of military
protection.  This seems like the central unsolved problem of
anarcho-syndicalist libertarians: since they cannot tax, they cannot
raise enough military force to defend against aggressive taxing
governments.  By the way, if anyone knows of a solution, I'd like to hear
it.

Historically, radically libertarian societies did not succeed against
coercive states that can tax.  Consider  the Law Merchant in late-feudal
Europe, or the legal anarchy of medieval Iceland.

 When the communications and organization revolutions of the 15th century
hit (mass literacy, double entry accounting, central banks etc.)  the
coercive governments adopted "commercial codes" to sap the legitimation
of the commercial arbiters.  
Then the governments conquered everything with the large armies that they
became able to raise.  The Law Merchant was pushed into its current niche
in international business law.  (The Law Merchant is a noncoercive
customary set of business practices, commercially arbitrated, and 
enforced by boycotts)

The U.S. was an exceedingly careful _2nd_ attempt to approximate a
libertarian utopia while still securing a common defense in this deadly
new world.

The U.S. was the real libertarian revolution, and we're living it. It
could be improved, as David Friedman points out, but we already have many
of the liberties that are possible in a libertarian society.

	References, "The Enterprise of Law", also see Dr. De Long's web
site
	at UC Berkeley economics, on the economics of the industrial
revolution.
	There's also a fine book called "The Frozen Republic" that
explains how
	the U.S. missed the utilitarian revolution in politics that
occurred in 
	England, which led directly to our very stable, but ridiculously 
	ineffective government.

The central weakness of libertarian philosophy is that it gives only
negative advice about the nature of a good life: e.g. Don't initiate
force, Minimize interference in other people's activities.  It lacks
advice about what's good.

Many of the U.S.'s social evils seem caused directly by this weakness.
Historically, in the U.S., this vacuum was filled by the churches, which
promoted traditional virtues that were also taught in school.

In England, hedonic utilitarianism was taken up to justify policy.  It
never made a big appearance in the U.S., because the revolution and
subsequent wars made British thought unpopular up until WW I.

U.S. society now seems to be succumbing to all kinds of problems caused
by perhaps, too much liberty for people to be wrong or evil. 

For example, the social inertia that I find so galling, seems to me to be
simple inability of most people to reason about hypothetical events. 
Therefore,these impaired non-extropians mis-invest, e.g. in new cars,
rather than longevity research.

Extropians on the other hand, are clearly pursuing good things.  Long
life, greater abilities, new techniques, new lands (Ad Astra!), etc.  I
would say that Extropians are practical modern utilitarians, pursuing the
good, and trying to minimize the evil, primarily in their own lives
because it is so hard to effect social changes in ordinary society.

If this analysis is right, freedom is not as limiting for Extropians as
other resources.  I at least, already have all the freedom I can use,
(except I wish for less taxes) and the very existence of this mailing
list is evidence of the same for its readers.  If I could buy a
space-ship, I could leave tomorrow.  I _am_ free to pursue longevity
techniques, and perform computer research.

But _why_ don't classic extropian goals get funded?  Well, because about
half of ordinary people don't reason about hypothetical futures. (I have
references- the buzzwords are 'Piagetian Formal operational reasoning in
adults')  

Thus, unless an organization tests to remove such impaired people from
authority, the organization cannot come to a consensus about nonexistent
innovations.  Simply
because, since they can't imagine it, they can' t distinguish impossible
things from
nonexistent things.

If the formally-operationally-handicapped (the FOH) are eliminated from
positions of power in our  institutions, the institutions should
automatically improve, because the authorities could then imagine
improvements, and could therefore carry them out.

Now this is not totally theoretical.  I have a case-study.
Something like this happened at Hanover Insurance.  In Industry Week (in
'91 I think)
the management of Hanover described how they did something similar.

Basically, they realized that they were in a static industry, and any
improvement would have to come from making better use of their people. By
years of hard work, they developed four general principles, which I
vaguely remember as: measurement of desired behavior, (an antidote to
politics), giving local authority (an antidote to bureaucracy), openness
(an antidote to information-hoarding), and getting rational managers (an
antidote to irrational management).

They realized that they needed rational managers because they found that
a lot of guys with good-looking resumes could not apply general
principles  to real organizations.  So, they began screening
manager-applicants for (if I remember rightly) the rationality and
emotional maturity to carry out HI's management plan.  They used
psychologists.  In my research I found references to pencil & paper tests
for formal operational reasoning, as well as one reference to teaching
methods.

In the 25 years between ~1965 and 1991, Hanover grew 1600% in a static
market.

When I talked to a cognitive psychologist (At UC Irvine) about this, he
pointed
me to developmental psychology, and found me my research references,
which tied in very nicely with the 1986 article in Reason Magazine by
Stephen Barone, entitled " Imagine that there's no. . ."  Basically,
about 50% of adults habitually do not reason about nonexistent
states-of-affairs.

Removing FOH from authority, of course, violates libertarian principles,
but I expect it to increase the ability of our society to pursue rational
goods.


Why I am not an objectivist:

I don't think altruism is self-deceit.  I believe that it's rational, and
Ayn Rand is abusing the term to create an attackable straw-man.  Here're
some rationales:

A world in which the strong do not help the weak has imprudent strong
people, because every person has inherent value to themselves, and no
strong person can predict when he or she might become weak, and therefore
need help.  If most strong people plan to give help, then help is more
likely to be available when it's needed.  E.O Wilson called this
"reciprocal altruism" in his famous book "Sociobiology."

Immanuel Kant also proved something very like this in the Foundations of
the Metaphysics of Morals.

In a like way, Jeremy Bentham ( the Utilitarian) said (In Principles of
Morals and Legislation) that we all have a duty to minimize the totality
of pain and suffering in the world.  I'm not sure that it's a duty,
exactly, but I agree that  the world is a better place with less pain and
suffering.  I want the world to be a better place, therefore I can accept
such a duty, and make my contributions.

In evolutionary ethics, E.O. Wilson in "Sociobiology" described two types
of selfish altruism: Kinship selection, and reciprocal altruism.  It
seems to me that even Randians should not object to these, and these can
account for many types of altruism that actually occur in our society.

An interesting example of  is public education: industrialists need
educated workers.  So therefore, should an industrialist give
scholarships?  Almost all popular public charities have similar
economics: we all benefit from educating poor
smart kids.  We all benefit from feeding poor kids, so that their brains
grow and
they can make it in the western civ, and sell things that we want.

I have come to believe that perfect virtue is indistinguishable from
perfect prudence. 

Also, I read several of Rand's works several times, including her book
about objectivist philosophy.  Her heroes are admirable, and her villains
are despicable.  Her philosophy book, however, reads like double-talk to
me: I think that she does not prove the things that she wishes to prove.

end of rant., and thank-you if you made it this far. . .

	it seems to me that the differences, while quite present, are merely 
matters of degree; degree of uncertainty, to be more specific. 
	lets say your gonna do a sociology experment: you do a survey. the 
uncertanity involved stems from, at the very least, the possiblity that the 
ppl you survey might be lying to you, and that there could always be a 
different explanation then the one you thought of that might better fit the 
data.
	now lets say your gonna do a physics experment: you take some 
measurements. the uncertainty involved stems from, at the very least, the 
possibility that the insturments your using might be malfunctioning, and that 
there could always be a different explanation then the one you thought of 
that might better fit the data.
	their both uncertain, of course... but its a lot easier to figure out 
if an insturment is malfunctioning then it is to figure out if a person is 
lying to you about the way they feel... so at root, are not both experments 
at least somewhat axiomatic?
	also: ive heard it said that hard sciences study 'objects', while 
soft sciences study the 'interactions' of those objects... but a reason i 
disagree with that is that the distenction between the 'interaction' and the 
'thing itself' get really really blurry sometimes... not to mention that even 
once u finally label things, its often impossible to study the 'thing' 
without studying the 'interactions', and vice versa... and arnt all 
'interactions' 'things', in some sense? 
	no, im not confused. i honestly know what im talkin about here

Sure, nanotechnology could could realize the ultimate internal

Really, there are much more _fun_ reasons to buy guns!
I think we should all buy assault rifles, so the government employees
will remain polite.

If a gun around the house makes you nervous, just take it apart, and
throw the parts away secretly in the garbage.  The statistics will still
keep the government polite.

<snippage = "more examples of behavior in which helping others helps oneself">

	i think the benchmark is pretty straightforward: if a behavior would 
benifit you in your opinion, then to take part in the behavior would be 
selfish. i thought altruism would be the opposite of this:  if a behavior 
would not benifit you in your opinion, then to take part in the behavior 
would be altrustic.  the examples you gave would all be of selfish behavior.

My local suburban rag had a piece today on a man who has persuaded the
council to `ban' (how?) `genetically modified food' (so I also await the
revaluation of pi). The reporter, one Martine Borrack, opened with this
astonishingly vicious throw-away:

< The debate is reminiscent of the plot of that '70s sci-fi flick *Soylent
Green*

< Set in New York in 2022, the population's survival depends on synthetic
food.

< Yet the shocking truth about its contents, that it is made out of humans,
goes unnoticed until a cop starts asking questions.

< No-one is suggesting that the newly emerging genetically modified food
industry is grinding up human corpses, but for people such as Scott
Kinnear, chairman of the Organic Federation of Australia, there are still
to many unknowns about the effects of biotechnology to be silent on the
issue. > (Moreland Courier, 24 May 1999, p. 9)

I know that rational debate is deemed to have ended when Hitler and Nazis
enters the metaphorium, but this atrocious misrepresentation reminded me of
nothing so much as the traditional lie that Jews were given to eating
gentile babies.  `No-one is suggesting...' says Ms Borrack disingenuously,
having done just that and nothing but that.

I wondered if she were going to make the link to what she'd doubtless see
as the horrid insertion of human-derived genes into food stuffs, since that
would have provided *some* semi-rational excuse for her thought-pollution.
It never emerged.  What she and Mr Kinnear discuss is the quite sensible
concern (as it seems to me) that widespread introduction of proprietary
crops gene-engineered for high resistance to pesticides will tend to leave
us eating food with more pesticide residues than before, as well as making
farmers more dependant on seed from those corporations, a kind of monopoly.  

I expect to see the *Soylent Green* meme misused increasingly, along with
other Frankenscience tropes.  Hard to combat, but we need to get in there
kicking and screaming - in a quiet and thoughtful way, of course. :)

I would like to say a few words on Natural Law and property rights.

There is a great confusion as to what Natural Law is all about. Some
interpret  it as a physical law, with the same level of predictory
power and the same level of formalism as e.g., Newton's law of gravitation.
That is mistaken. Natural law is a theory which predicts that human
societies will tend to have certain legal (and moral) structures in
common, namely a basic respect for induvidual property rights, both in
person
and in material things. The evidence is, I think, indisputable. You will
find no
society where it has been legal to kill a fellow citizen for no reason. Of
course, all
societies have had slightly different definitions of what a "fellow citizen"
is, but virtually
all  societies have sooner or later evolved institutions that punish murder,
kidnapping,
theft etc. Even Nazi Germany did not allow just any German to kill or steal
from any other German.

Natural Law theory further predicts that the harder you try to suppress the
natural institutions
of basic property rights the more violence you need to employ to succeed,
and then
you will still only succeed for a time (witness the fate of communism).
For a peaceful and orderly society to survive you need a certain
institutional
recognition of property rights.

Natural Law theory doesn't prove libertarians right about "the government
that governs least
governs best", but it does indicate that government must respect and support
certain fundamental institutions, namely property.

Joe, how about you stop projecting the worst aspects of your personality
onto the rest of us? Just because you can't see someone think differently
without wanting to kill them doesn't mean that we can't. Indeed, us 'gun
nuts' want to allow all those different people to own guns to protect
themselves; to a rational mind I would have thought that would rather 
indicate that we're not actually intending to kill them... unlike the
disarmers, who've been murdering 'different' people all century long.

Technical details of this system are hard to find on their web site, but
this does explain one rather alarming comment that I saw; to support this
roaming, they apparently store your private key *on their server* and 
download it to the web browser when you want to use it. You'd better be 
sure you have a damn good passphrase...

we can't bypass evolution laws... for myself i do believe that this whole

What would be the probability of your particular existence guessed from the

who knows???

If the probability of failure tend to zero with time, for self-reproducing

But a foglet does not have nanoscale positional control, at least not
JoSh's design. It would be able to do microscale stuff, but not
position atomes into an autoreplicator. Positional control is
necessary for making the stuff, but the customers do not need to have
it built in in the fog.

Still, a ufog weapon has some potential for mayhem, and I have no
doubt at all that it can be misused creatively. Hmm, if it edits what
is seen through it, one could hide a lot of activities under an ufog
cover.

How do you tell? Actually, I think this thought is a bit dangerous
because the ends of transhumanism doesn't overlap with the companies
above. The *means* does, we all want technology to get better, but
Intel haven't the least interest in enhancing human potential. In
fact, many of the larger companies are likely more on the stasist side
(to borrow Postrel's term) than the dynamist side where we are. Just
waiting for transutopia to emerge thanks to Intel, Geron and IBM is a
bit too passive, and might leave the initiative to groups working
against our ends.

You mean not saying "No-one is suggesting that the anti GM-crop
movement is supported by religious fundamentalists and militant child
molesters?" :-)

Overall, I think this goes for all of us transhumanists: Write more!
Debate more! Make your views heard. Even if people think you are
strange or wrong, the more a view is made public all the time the less
easy it is to dismiss it. Our most important objective media-wise
right now is to make transhumanism a respectable perspective, and not
just something that can be dismissed as fringe or unsupported.

I would be surprised, it is after all a sophisticated mechanism
relying on group cooperation of trillions of foglets, each containing
nanocomputers, microscale actuators, sensors and
networking. Obviously, nanocomputers will have to be developed first.

Just look at the fear that has been caused by more or less well
founded worries about the pill (cancer), nuclear power (radioactive
disasters), aspartame (just about any illness), electromagnetic fields
etc. In many cases these worries have limited their introduction
significantly. And ufog could really have some gory failure modes -
imagine being trapped inside when all the foglets freeze up into a
lattice, or if the foglets start to rub against fragile surfaces - a
few scare stories, and customers might be less willing to trust it.

> Is ufog more dangerous than a car? Than having guns around the

Depends on how it is programmed. My guess is that versatility is often
proportional to the danger (just look at programming), so a weak ufog
would be less dangerous than a car (having active microscale
structures in the air is likely already more potentially dangerous
than cleaning products), while a powerful ufog could very well be a
loaded gun.

Evolution does not depend on the bug getting squashed, but upon a bug's mutation giving it the ability to AVOID getting squashed better than other bugs.

No it does not depend on failure. Evolution is all about success, not failure. Becoming more successful than others does not make those others failures.

a) Nothing is perfect, so your criticism on that basis is worthless. So long as humans are involved no system will ever be perfect.
b) Evolution of any type, and any economic system that is to survive adversity, catastrophe, and change, must be imperfect. There must be sufficient variation in the population of participants such that if some unforseen threat develops, only a portion of the participant population may be damaged or destroyed. The imperfection of these systems are their strengths, not their weakenesses.

Not at all. You must be one of those people who believe that 'the rich get richer and the poor get poorer'. The fact is that in a mercantilist/capitalist economy like ours, the poor get richer too, just not as quickly as the rich do. In a more purely free market economy, the middle class tends to grow much more.

Life is a trial with probability of failure greater than zero. Even if we acheived immortality, the average life span would be around 4600 years, due to the odds of accidental death that is unrevivable (typically severe brain damage). Too bad. Economically, even if you become the richest person on the planet, there are still going to be things you CANNOT buy.

That's life. Even 'immortal' life is eventually fatal, as described above. I think though that this post of yours says more about your own confidence in your odds or capability of success than it does about the system you denigrate. Life is like a video game, it challenges you, eventually we all run out of quarters, and absolutely nobody gets a perfect score in this game, but its no fun if you refuse to play.

Or Pravda Street. Actually, capitalism is far more about cooperation than socialism or communism is, because every action is voluntary. In the communal systems, action is forced, which is not cooperation, but enslavement.

How do you tell? Actually, I think this thought is a bit dangerous
because the ends of transhumanism doesn't overlap with the companies
above. The *means* does, we all want technology to get better, but
Intel haven't the least interest in enhancing human potential. In
fact, many of the larger companies are likely more on the stasist side
(to borrow Postrel's term) than the dynamist side where we are. Just
waiting for transutopia to emerge thanks to Intel, Geron and IBM is a
bit too passive, and might leave the initiative to groups working
against our ends.

"Economics" is misplaced here; while its application to human
behavior might be "soft", the science itself is a branch of
mathematics no less hard than Physics.  In fact moreso; mathematical
facts are true by definition and tautology--physical law is
merely assumption by lack of counterexample (we've never seen
conservation of mass-energy violated, so we call it a "law").

  Great idea - I've always felt one bird (life) in hand was worth two in
the bush. With numerous breakthroughs being made in eliminating the
rigours of old age in rodents, as well as reducing disease processes in
humans, we're entering into the golden age of life extension.
  For those with a scientific bent, specific examples of the former are
rejuvenation of both mitochondrial function, and ambulatory activity
independantly by both acetyl-l-carnitine and lipoic acid. (see Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. USA 95: 9562-9566 August 1998, and FASEB J. 13: 411-418
February 1999) Examples of the later are reductions in human 
cardiovascular disease mortality by consumption of nuts, and omega-3
fatty acids, and of prostate cancer by tomato ingestion. Note the recent
dates on the rodent studies. Things are moving faster now than ever before
in the field of life-extension. Worried about becoming senile? Avoid
omega-6 fatty acids like the plague, and guzzle down omega-3's as well as
monosaturated fats!
  A lot of this cutting edge research simply has not had time yet to
filter through to the general public. It looks like even now we have the
ability to largely empty out old age homes of their occupants, and
restore relatively normal lives to most of them. I would be very surprised
if at least some of us are not around at the end of the next century.

That is one of the two fundamental barriers I see in the way of
government-free society.  I've never seen a good solution to the problem,
and I'm pretty sure that there isn't one yet - we're going to need some kind
of major innovation to deal with it.

The other fundamental barrier I see is the problem of restraining the use of
force in the anarchist society.  The problem is that market mechanisms are
the only available means for restraining violence in an anarchy, but these
mechanisms do not function properly unless the use of force is already
constrained.  We thus have the problem of setting up a system that
establishes its own preconditions, which is a very difficult proposition.

We've got some of the 'low-hanging  fruit', but we are still far short of
the point of diminishing returns.  A government consisting solely of a
criminal justice system, a system of civil law, and state and war
departments, would allow substantially more freedom than our current system
without posing any real practical difficulties.

Modern America is less oppressed than the rest of the world, but it still
offers its citizens rather limited freedom.  We don't even have the freedoms
explicitly spelled out in the Bill of Rights, let alone the vast body of
freedom implied by the doctrine of enumerated powers.

Well, yes.  OTOH, that is only a weakness if you are looking for a complete
ethical system.  As a purely political philosophy this is actually a
strength - it means that anyone who recognizes individual rights and human
fallibility can take part in the system, regardless of the details of their
personal ethics.

If we try to build a unified body of thought that covers everything from
personal ethics to epistemology to political theory, we will inevitably end
up with a system that only a small group of people will be willing to adopt.
The result is a political impotence that allows the forces of collectivism
to have their way unopposed.  By creating a political philosophy that does
not rely on any one specific view of these other issues, we make it much
more feasible for individualists of many different stripes to cooperate in
the defense of liberty.

Actually, it would be illegal for you to build or operate a spacecraft - you
need a few tens of thousands of pages worth of permits and paperwork before
you'll be allowed to play with toys like that.  Research is subject to
relatively light regulation, but actually using the fruits of that research
is another matter.

What is your definition of "perfect"?  Evolutionary forms
(mutation/selection), such as free market capitalism, are pretty much ideal
when working with any system where transaction costs are greater than zero.
 I might add, though, that free market capitalism is not practiced anywhere
in the world today and that most of the ills of capitalism directly or
indirectly result from the fact that it is not a free market.

The problem is that all the other economic systems are "doomed to failure"
as well.  The real benefit of free market capitalism is that it allows you,
the individual, to minimize your failure rate, whereas most other economic
systems set that rate for you to some extent.  You have a vested interest
in setting your own failure rate; delegating that ability runs a far higher
risk of a net loss than taking responsibility, particularly since the
people to whom the responsibility is delegated are trying to minimize
*their* failure rate as well, even if at the expense of yours.

The principle of Self Determination allows everyone to set their own rate
of failure, and I believe that given the freedom to set my own failure
rate, that I can minimize my failure to the maximum extent possible.  You
can never win, but you can cheat the odds for a really long time -- entropy
in a nutshell.

Uh, last I checked, America imprisoned a larger fraction of its population
than any country other than Russia; that sounds a lot like oppression to
me. There are various areas where America does beat the rest of the world
in terms of freedom, but you can find plenty of exceptions.

Sounds reasonable. But medical and avionics systems have to deal with
fairly well defined environments; the number of things that might be
thrown at ufog in an ordinary home (just imagine what the toddlers do)
are astronomical. Hmm, that actually suggests an ufog problem: getting
foglets into liquids where they shouldn't be - how can we guarantee
that none of the fog gets into our food?

To err is human? :-)

Yes, a double system would be reasonable. Most likely human
supervisors may be left too, so that there is somebody to personally
blame for everything :-)

I had the impression that utility fog, despite the name, was more of a
gel than a fog.  It does not have free-floating foglets, but rather it is
a contiguous material which flows around the inhabitants, always keeping
a small distance from them.  It has lasers which constantly track the
eyes of the people living within it so that any desired scene can be
projected to them, making the fog invisible.  It might not even have
to be extremely close to the inhabitants but perhaps could be several
inches away, much of the time.

There will presumably be pieces constantly breaking off due to failures,
so it is a legitimate concern that these be inert and unharmful when
breathed or swallowed.  Hopefully the pieces would be very tiny and the
rate of such failures would be small enough that the health problems
would be minor.

It depends on how you measure freedom.  The number of ways in which the
American government restricts its citizens is smaller than average, but some
of those restrictions put an awful lot of people in jail.  Of course, the
real tragedy is that the difference between America and places like France
and Russia is small enough that we can argue about who is better.

BTW, I think we actually have a higher incarceration rate than Russia these
days.

So what? In his case he's just another borganist who wants a wonderful

I have two simple questions for those who have expressed anti-property
opinions on this thread.

To those who have suggested that we should abandon private property, I ask
what you propose to replace it with.  We can't determine which alternative
is superior unless we actually have two concrete ideas to compare.

To those who have suggested that we should abandon any sort of property
system, I have a more fundamental question.  A system of property exists to
answer the basic question "Who decides what will be done with any given
resource?"  If your answer is that each individual always decides what to do
with the fruits of his own labor, you are on your way to a private property
system.  If you say that some other entity will always make the decision,
you are on the road to collectivism.  If you say that the answer depends on
the situation, then you are exploring the middle ground of socialism.

So, if you reject all of these alternatives, I must ask how you propose that
such decisions should be made.

Might I suggest this is the wrong approach?  Instead assume it will get 
into the food.  Think about how to ensure it won't be harmful there.

I say there are situations where other methods than private property work
best for organizing the use of resources.

For example, when two siblings share a bedroom, they often paint a
line down the middle and say that each one owns one half of the room.
However this can be inefficient, as in many cases there are common
resources which can't be easily divided with geometric arrangements
like this.  It might be necessary to install a second closet and door
in order for this to work.  This is expensive and inefficient.

It is simpler to view most parts of the room as jointly owned by
the siblings, and possibly by other members of the family as well.
When someone uses more than his "fair share" of the resources, social
pressure is applied to rectify the situation.

Another case is ownership of ants.  Yes, we can say which ant is owned
by each person, but it is hard to keep track of them.  Sometimes when
they meet and bump antennas, then separate, it's hard to tell which
was which.  Then when they go underground we have to send in our little
robot ants so that we can follow them around and keep track of them.
And of course uncontrolled and unplanned breeding raises the issue of
who owns the offspring.  Many thorny issues arise in this situation.

It is simpler not to view individual ants as owned or ownable.

Here on the extropians list, rather than having to pay for each posting,
it is simpler to treat it as a commons, a communal resource.  Anyone
is free to post to the list and we all benefit from reading their words.
Where abuse occurs, a combination of social pressure and, if necessary,
technical means (address blocking, etc.) can deal with the situation.

In the case of air, I can own the air over my property.  Unfortunately,
it won't stay put.  It keeps blowing around to be the air over someone
else's property.  This raises confusing issues about who owns the air.
I can construct bubbles over my property to hold my air in, but this is
expensive, and it is hard to get the closed ecology working.

It is simpler to treat air as a common resource which is not owned in
this sense.  Where problems of pollution arise, they can be dealt with
either by regulation, by torts (suing the polluters), or by *abstract*
markets in pollution rights.  But it's just not efficient to have
individual pieces of air owned by specific individuals.

I think you have tremendously oversimplified the situation here.  Even if
we agree that we should use property rights to dispose of the fruits
of our labor, that would only refer to made objects.  In fact, people
often try to extend property beyond things which humans have created,
such as the ants and air in my examples above.

Even in the context of human creations, it is often the case that
property rights are not the most effient means of deciding what will
be done with them.  Families do not use property rights to make many
of their resource allocation decisions, and neither do corporations,
and neither do voluntary communities like our own.  It could be done; we
could pay for each posting, and every object in your home could be owned
by a specific person.  But we don't do that, because it is not efficient.

Exactly; my fault for not thinking properly <adjusted>. Henrik
Öhrström pointed out that mesoscale nanomachines might actually pose a
hazard similar to silicosis or asbestosis by being fairly large
structures the macrophages in the lung cannot handle. I seem to recall
that the ufog designs involved inert foglets with silicon(?) shells;
maybe they should be made vulnerable to the chemicals released by
lymphocytes or other cells. Maybe some connectors made of protein, for
example.

You'll be pleased to know that after numerous requests from

instead of lard. They did provide the lard on request.

We went traditional, and ours was better.....

I seems to recall Mr Musick told that he believed that if all peoples had
complete respect for each other there would be no need of property rights...
but i'm not sure at all of my correct formulation of his thinking... of
course I believe this one above to be completly impractical.

Why the separation? Could not the U-fog be designed to have direct contact?
   Nutrients could  be absorbed directly through the skin
and mucous membranes  to eliminate the need for eating. At the other end of
 the spectrum, bodily wastes would be absorbed as they
are released by the U-fog.  The U-fog would also be a breathing medium that
 adjusted itself as required to supply oxygen at times of peak activity.

If you exclude crimes which are lesser or are not offenses in other countries we'd have a far more comparative level of imprisonment. Additionally China has a higher fraction in prison, if you include 're-education camps' as prisons. I find it interesting that the three most powerful nations have the highest prison populations....

On the other hand, since most crime here is commited by criminals on other criminals, I can't say that you could call all of our prisoners 'oppressed'. As far as I know the only throught crimes here in the US are pornographic pedophilia, telling the President what you really think of him, looking at female co-workers the wrong way, and disliking the publicly protected ethnic groups.

It appears that Damien thought he was posting to the list, when maybe 
he wasn't; I'm taking the liberty of forwarding his mail to me on that theory.
In particular, I agree with Damien and wanted to go on record. Something
like:
I really wanted George Lakoff at the Foresight Group Genius meeting.
I think the "embodied" cognitive work in progress is important in many ways.

I was tired of hearing the raving randian bastards on this list label 
everybody who disagreed with the slightest scintilla of their pet 
dogmas as evil vermin who should be exterminated for the greater 
good, and figured they'd like a gander of getting goosed by the 
same slimestick themselves to see how the fuck it feels to be 
slandered by association with extremists.  It's simply karmic tit-for-
tat; you don't do it to others, it doesn't get done back to you!  And 
it's the people with the guns who are shooting everybody (always 
has been); they play this little "Shane" home movie in their heads 
about how they're righteous people pushed too far by bullying 
cliques, and the next thing you know, fifteen kids are lying dead in 
school halls, and the gun lobby steps on its dick by claiming that if 
a guard had a gun he coulda stopped them when one did and 
couldn't, and Li'l Einstein Danny Quayle kisses Wayne LaPierre's 
ring by saying he hoped the massacre wasn't used as an excuse 
to restrict gun sales!  FUCK excuses; it's a goddamned REASON!  
Finally the Senate got a testicle transplant and put some 
safeguards on the criminal flea market gun shows where two of the 
guns were bought, and insists on safety locks so's if Junior nurses 
a carelessly left automatic and plays with the trigger, he won't get 
a lead lunch!  About Damned Time!

The skin is a rather good barrier, so you cannot get much
in. Nutrients through the mucous membranes might work, but I doubt the
permeability is good enough to allow more than a trickle. But maybe
one could have edible foglets, and when you are hungry you just
swallow the air...

Another nice thing: it could control dust and bacteria fairly well.

Since we obviously have a flamewar on gun control and another one on
libertarian states brewing (trust me, I have been on this list so long
that I can feel approaching flames in my mouse-arm :-), it might be
interesting to try to use them for something constructive.

When we become angry or just aroused, our thinking changes. We become
more reactive, use well-trained standard responses and overall modify
our behavior in a way that was quite suitable for physical threats on
the African savannah or before. Unfortunately these responses are ill
suited to "information threats" - when you encounter a view you
dislike or a complex technological threat the best response is likely
more rational thinking, more reflexion and creativity rather than
less. Speed is not as important as it was when a tiger was chasing
your ancestors.

This suggests that as a part in our self-transformation towards more
rational beings, able to function in an extremely complex and fluid
transhuman reality, we should learn to control the old flight-or-fight
response. If we cannot, the consequences might be bad both personally
and generally (imagine a Jupiter brain getting angry at somebody
sprouting silly religious fundamentalism - suddenly it is just as
silly as Jahve when it lashes out). One way of training oneself is to
expose one's sacred cows, those core views which may not be
questioned. They are often easy to detect by noting a rise in arousal
when they are questioned even implicitely. But it is usually just
these views that need to be questioned to make thought flexible and
rational. So once they are detected, it might be very healthy to try
to habituate oneself against getting upset about them; this can be
used to remove a lot of needless knee-jerk reactions and build the
foundations of a slightly more rational personality.

The reason I mention this right now is of course that the flamewars
are an excellent opportunity to both test these ideas and try to train
away needless reactions. I don't think this posting will get rid of
the flames, but I hope we can use them as learning tools too.

<insert assorted examples>

Yes, there are situations in which a strict adherence to the idea of
individual ownership of everything would not work.  However, 'private
property' does not imply that everything must be owned by an individual.

Some resources have little or no economic significance, and thus are not
worth the bother of keeping track of.  So, regardless of our economic
system, no one will worry about who owns which ant or which cc of air
because no one cares.

Voluntary collectives can sometimes work, but only for very small groups
with very strong social bonds.  As the collective grows in size the
connection between an individual's efforts and the rewards he receives
becomes more tenuous, and the ability of the group to inspire contributions
via social pressure diminishes.  It also becomes more and more difficult for
even an honest, hard-working individual to make an optimal contribution to
the group, because there is no clear source of information to tell him how
he should spend his time.

Involuntary collectives, of course, have a dismal track record regardless of
their size.  Even in an individual family, where the forces of corruption
are at an absolute minimum and the motivation for the rulers to be
benevolent is maximized, those who are ruled are rarely happy about the
situation.

But perhaps I assume too much.  Are you suggesting that we should be looking
for ways to replace private property with collective ownership of some kind,
or merely pointing out that there are occasional situations where the full
private property treatment is more trouble than it is worth?

You are correct.  I should also state that a system of private property
allows individuals and organizations to freely buy and sell things that are
found in nature, while a pure collectivist system forbids all such exchanges
and a socialist system falls somewhere in between.  However, this is not
much of an addition, because it is a separate case for only the most basic
of material inputs (land, air, etc.)  Most things we think of as 'natural
resources' do not exist in any useable form until someone invests effort to
create them, so the question I pose directly describes a large majority of
the economy.

I'm still curious as to whether anyone can suggest a different way of
dealing with this issue.

In all of these cases those who actually own the property are the ones who
make the decisions about how it will be used - directly in the case of small
groups like a family, and indirectly in larger organizations. I think what
you are really trying to say here is that they don't use markets to make
their decisions.  That is true, and in some of these cases it is a good
thing, but in others it isn't.

A free market is a mechanism that a large group of people to efficiently
allocate resources in a complex environment.  It uses price signals to allow
each person to locally optimize their own behavior, and over time these same
signals will lead the entire system to allocate resources in a way that
matches the desires of all of its participants as closely as is possible.
No one ever needs to understand what is happening for this process to work,
and no one ever decides what the ultimate goal will be.

Now, running a market involves certain costs.  It takes effort to establish
the market, effort to buy and sell things, etc.  This inevitably means that
for very small systems it is not worthwhile to establish a market.  If a
group is small enough that its members can simply discuss their situation
and agree on their goals, there is no need for a more elaborate structure.
If a system is simple enough that a single human mind can understand its
behavior, appointing a manager makes more sense than establishing a market.
If a resource has so little economic significance that it would cost more
that it is worth to buy and sell it, then there is no reason to create a
market for it.

However, this does not mean that there is never a need for markets.  In
fact, the opposite is true.  In small organizations an authoritarian or
collective system can work well, but as the scale increases they become
increasingly ineffective.  Central planning on the scale of a large
corporation is very inefficient, which is why there is such a strong
movement towards decentralized decision-making today.  On the scale of a
modern economy it is even worse - an economy without markets has its hands
full just keeping people fed, as the Russians recently demonstrated.

So, I would say that the best approach is to make free markets and private
property the default assumption for all economic activity.  If individuals
find it advantageous to voluntarily pool their resources into small
collectives from time to time, this system would leave them free to do so.
They would also be free to form any other sort of organization they wish,
which would presumably lead to the best overall results that we can hope
for.

Well, we tried going the route that european prisons are: pretty much forced vocational education and psych treatment. Problem was, the recidivism stats showed that it was a failure here. Here, the stats seem to bear out that if you make prison life as unbearable as possible, a crook is far less likely to want to go back to such an institution, so they took out the weight lifting equipment (reduces guard costs, esp. medical bills) they are taking out the college courses, etc. except at the minimum security resorts.

My basic objection against the current (Euro & US) prison systems is that:
1) They allow physical contact between inmates, which opens the 
door for rape, beatings, murder and other nastiness. Ironically, the 
worst, most hardened & violent criminals have the easiest time, while 
the lesser offenders suffer under their regime.
2) The prison officials have way too much power, which results in
situations as described above. In other words, the prison system
is, just like the rest of the legal system btw, pretty much arbitrary.

The solution: automated prisons (afaik, Greg Burch had a great
post about this once). One inmate per cell, no physical contact
between inmates and only highly monitored contact between 
guards and inmates. For good measure, every square inch of the 
prison should have camera surveillance, with direct and well-protected 
links to independent controlling organizations, at least some of which 
should be private (non-government), lawyers and maybe even the 
prisoner's relatives. All recorded data should be stored for at least
one year, to serve as evidence in the rare case of some mishap
(example: was a suicide *really* a suicide?). 

Educational programs, psychiatric/medical treatments should
be optional, but simply keeping the offender out of the general
population (in the case of murderers, by means of capital 
punishment) is good enough as far as I'm concerned.

Legislation is violence.  No matter how much one pretends that this
isn't true, the fact won't go away.  Those who propose and pass laws
are enabling armed police to forcibly detain and imprison people who
violate them, even if they do so peacefully.  Sometimes civilized
discourse is not sufficient to point out just how evil some of these
actions really are.

If you advocate legislation, be prepared to back up your opinions
with your blood.  You are morally responsible for the violence
used to enforce those laws, and a legitimate target for those who
fight them.  I am prepared to take moral responsibility for laws
against violence and theft; if history proves me wrong, I accept
the consequences.  I am not willing to accept such responsibility
for laws against peaceful use of technology--be it drugs, money,
or guns--or laws granting "property" status to ideas, and many other
laws that some people favor.  I may be wrong, and I'm willing to
entertain discussions on the matter peacefully.  But when a bill is
signed into law, the line between discussion and force has been
crossed, and I cannot be silent.  No matter how loudly I may "rave",
it is still peaceful discourse compared to the violence of law.

History has already proven you wrong; laws against theft' rape and 
murder were instituted because people were being robbed, raped 
and murdered.  BTW, how dare you presume to arrogate yourself 
the "moral responsibility" for the consequenses of an anonymous 
other's death?  Until you can restore life to them, you have neither 
the power nor the stature to bear up under such a burden.

But not compared to the massacres which are now routinely 
perpetrated in our schools by those to whom we look to carry the 
future.  How can you defend a system which allows our children to 
fatally mass murder each other?  I'm a military vet, a hunter, and 
own five guns of my own, yet the idea of these kids killing each 
other like they are in some crazed puter game is incomprehensible 
to me.  The insane among us are those who, for whatever sick or 
profitteering reason, not only refuse to close the loopholes which 
lead to such weapons possession, but who continue to either 
stand idly by or applaud as the gun industry, to support its future 
position in the marketplace, sells maiming, paralysis, coma and 
death to our children via the same shamelessly cynical product 
placement ad campaigns we see employed to push tobacco.

This is tatamount to solitary confinement for all prisoners, all the
time. My understanding is that many prisoners in such prisons consider
them far crueler than prisons that allow them human contact, however
dangerous it may be.

More dishonest argument.  Our system certainly does not "allow"
such activity, and you have provided no rational evidence that it
even encourages it, or provided any alternative that might be better.
Mindlessly reacting to the misuse of hardware by calling for laws
restricting the hardware is irrational and groundless.  Show me some
real thought--show me a rational argument why a particular law will
have any positive effect on the violence you see, or I will have no
choice but to oppose it, because the law itself is /known/ violence,
and to practice real violence to only speculatively reduce some
possible future violence without any evidence is morally wrong.
(Here's a hint: "It's obvious that..." is not a rational argument).

I don't give a shit that your motives are pure (if indeed they are).
Motives don't count, results do.  If you can't show me that laws
will have actual results of reducing violence, then spare me your
tear-jerking rhetoric.

No _physical_ contact isn't the same as no contact whatsoever. People
could communicate trough fences/reinforced glass barriers/intercoms
etc. Except for some rapists, I presume most wouldn't miss the physical
element too much...

Title
  Coenzyme Q10 administration increases brain mitochondrial concentrations and
  exerts neuroprotective effects.

  America.  95(15):8892-7, 1998 Jul 21.
Abstract
  Coenzyme Q10 is an essential cofactor of the electron transport chain as well
  as a potent free radical scavenger in lipid and mitochondrial membranes.
  Feeding with coenzyme Q10 increased cerebral cortex concentrations in 12- and
  24-month-old rats. In 12-month-old rats administration of coenzyme Q10
  resulted in significant increases in cerebral cortex mitochondrial
  concentrations of coenzyme Q10. Oral administration of coenzyme Q10 markedly
  attenuated striatal lesions produced by systemic administration of
  3-nitropropionic acid and significantly increased life span in a transgenic
  mouse model of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These results show
  that oral administration of coenzyme Q10 increases both brain and brain
  mitochondrial concentrations. They provide further evidence that coenzyme Q10
  can exert neuroprotective effects that
  might be useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Mindfully reacting to the misuse of hardware by calling for laws 
restricting access to the hardware by those who are most likely to 
misuse it (violent criminals, spouse abusers, the insane, children, 
etc.) is both rational and supported by any faculty of reason 
deserving of the name.

A blatant cop-out.  You either know, or should, that the effects of 
such measures can only be determined in practice.  Pass a law 
restricting access to firearms for the above groups of people 
coupled with universal background checks to determine if in fact 
any particular person is a member of those groups and a law 
requiring trigger locks to be sold with every firearm (so that they will 
either be harder to misuse if the locks are used or it will be easier 
to assess responsibility through neglect if they are not), and check 
in a reasonable amount of time to see if violence has indeed been 
reduced.  BTW, the economic prostitution of the political right to 
the NRA and the placement of weapons as "problem solvers" in 
movies designed to appeal to teens is not rhetoric, but fact; if you 
don't like these facts, let's work together to change them. teen

If you can't show me without testing that the desired results (less 
kids and spouses killed) would not obtain, you are simply arguing 
that the absence of the invisible is difficult to detect.  You are 
acting just like the DEA concerning medical marijuana; first you 
say there's no evidence of a beneficial effect, then you take a 
dogmatic and self-righteous stand against the very test necessary 
to gather that evidense, not, I suspect, because you (and they) 
think it would not be forthcoming, but precisely because it WOULD 
BE.  In ther absence of the evidence whose gathering you forbid, 
your position, like solipsism, may be difficult to refute, but when 
applied to the lives of our kids, it is as morally bankrupt as 
solipsism is sterile.

What about water?  That is something which people do care very much about,
especially here in southern California.  Tremendous fortunes have been
won and lost fighting over water.  But what the fight is over are water
rights, an abstract form of property which involves the right to draw a
certain amount of water at certain times of year.  No one tries to keep
track of individual parcels of water simply because it is impractical
due to its fluid nature.

It's not that water is economically insignificant, it's that society has
to set up organizational structures which are appropriate to solving
the problem at hand.  Water rights make more sense than ownership of
parcels of water, when dealing with rivers.  We have to move away from
a literal application of property rights in pieces of matter, to a more
abstract form.

The same thing happens with fresh air.  Air pollution is economically
significant.  If the nature of air permitted it, property rights in
air would be one way to address this problem.  But nature forces us
to use different methods to deal with air pollution, some of which I
listed earlier.  One such method does use an abstract form of property,
in the form of pollution rights.  This has some advantages over torts
and regulation, and some disadvantages as well.

The point in each of these cases is that we must address the problem
by the most effective tool.  Wearing ideological blinders which insist
that Property Rights decreed by Natural Law are the One Way will not
allow us to solve problems effectively.  Demonizing those who suggest
alternatives, calling them "evil" and "looters", is counterproductive
(not that you have done so, but others in this community have).

It's surprising that you should say this, when here and now we are engaged
in a voluntary collective enterprise, in our participation on this mailing
list.  A very small group, yes, in a way; some dozens of active posters,
probably a few hundred who listen in.  But strong social bonds?  Hardly.
Most of us have never met, and when people disappear from the list,
few people even notice.

Why do you contribute here?  Who pays you for your time and energy?  Your
contributions are valuable, and I think many of us have profited by your
insights.  What do we offer in return?  Only our own thoughts and ideas,
which hopefully will be of some value to you.  There is no quid pro quo
here; nobody is keeping score.

I suspect that such voluntary relationships will become even more common
in the future.  As we move into an information economy, what we will be
consuming and producing will be bits, not atoms.  Already my own children
spend almost every leisure hour online, as do I.  Because of the many
problems with controlling intellectual property in the information age,
we may well see people become more motivated by intangible rewards than by
monetary payment.  The open source movement is just one example of this,
as is the underground warez and music/video trade.  Reputation becomes
the reward, having a name and persona which is recognized and respected.

Consider, perhaps, a marriage rather than a family.  Usually those are
not organized as ruler and ruled.  There are conflicts of course, but
most people find it more convenient to control most of their resources
communally.  And they are in fact happy with this arrangement.

I do think that there will be more opportunities in the future
for organization around collective ownership.  There will also be
opportunities to use private property at a scale we do not see today,
like the "libertarian space station" where even the air is owned.
I expect that there will be many experiments along these lines.

I think it was Mike Lorrey who posted a few days ago about Pacific
islanders who supposedly had societies which didn't use property rights.
He said that their lives were so easy, and the necessities so abundant,
that there was plenty for all and so their culture went in other
directions.

I don't know if this is anthropologically accurate, but it does seem
that it could apply to an island (space station/asteroid) culture of
the future.  Self-contained, self-sufficient, relatively small, with
the technology and resources to meet all the basic physical needs of
food, shelter, etc.  Individuals who are unhappy with such a society
could leave and strike off on their own.  In such a situation people
could focus their attention on other goals than acquiring property.
There would be no need for property rights in most cases.  Conflicts would
be resolved socially.  Productive people would be rewarded by the respect
and admiration of others.

Another way in which the future could be more cooperative would be
by using computers to mediate decision making.  Again, keep in mind
that this would be done in the context of a voluntary community where
everyone has agreed to use and be bound by this mechanism.  One problem
with collective control in the past has been corruption and greed on
the part of those entrusted with control.  Today it would be possible
to use computer networks to allow democracy at a much larger scale than
in the past.  Online voting, especially combined with modern economic
protocols like preference voting and auction based systems, can allow for
group decision making without the possibility of corrupt rulers, because
there are no rulers to corrupt.  The effect of these technologies is to
raise the threshold for community size in which cooperative relationships
can be effective.

It is true that, in the case of a family, property rights are used to
distinguish the family's property versus that of others in the outside
world, at least in this country.  Property rights prevent others from
coming in and using those resources.  At a larger scale, national
governments with their military forces prevent other nations from coming
in and forcibly taking and using the resources of the family.

These global issues are not relevant to the question of when and whether
property rights are useful.  The fact that the family exists in a larger
scheme of property rights, which itself exists in a larger scheme of
military forces holding each other at bay, does not tell us anything
about whether property rights are useful and relevant within the family.

We have the computing power to model the economy at a much finer scale
than in the past.  If it was just a matter of running an economy, making
routine decisions, responding to shortages, allocating resources, we could
probably do a good job with the computing resources which exist today.
There are only 6 billion people in the world, and most people are
price takers, so the task any one of them faces is not that difficult.
If 6 billion people *voluntarily* decided to set up an economic system
which used computers to allocate resources rather than property rights,
I don't think it is true any longer that the computers would not be
up to the job, although it would have been true in the past.  And with
computer power increasing exponentially, the argument against central
planning based on lack of computer resources becomes ever weaker.

Russia is mired in corruption.  They have not succeeded any better with
markets than without them.  You can't build a society out of people who
believe that the only way to survive is by breaking the rules.

Economists will tell you that virtually all activities are economic.

What does "default assumption" mean in this context?  Do you mean
that most marriages should by default assume that all property will be
individually owned?  Should most businesses start off with the default
assumption that each lamp and pencil will be owned by one employee?

I don't think you can prescribe a default assumption for society in this
way.  The only default is that people need to choose the organizational
structure which is most appropriate to the job at hand.  In practice they
should choose by default that structure which others have successfully
used in similar circumstances.  That is the best default assumption I
could recommend for them.

We can certainly agree on this.

Gosh, what a wonderful question!

Why don't we become a big hive mind, and then since we will all be "I", 
I will own everything, and I can do whatever I think best?

It looks to me like property is really a caching solution to a
communication problem.  We vest resource rights in local processors
(people) because it's too hard to transfer the knowledge of individuals
using our low-bit rate natural languages.

Also, people have different genomes, and thus different evolutionary
accounts to which the resource are totted-up.  Still, this seems soluble,
too, since 99% of human genomes are shared.

I don't think computer networks can fix direct democracy.

Direct democracy failed in Athens.  I think it will fail anywhere,
anytime, with
any technology, except possibly transhumanism.

The problem is that orators come to dominate a direct democracy. 

 Athens had several famous, expensive schools
of rhetoric, and orators were famous for persuading the athenian court of
nonsense,
and for getting rich in the process.

The solution that fixes direct democracy is representative democracy, a
"republic" so that governmental specialists like judges and legislators
can penetrate the rhetoric.

The classic example of direct democratic folly is the battle of Mytilene.
 Athenian generals were prominent citizens with military skills, who
volunteered their time and ability for the good of the state.  The
Athenian court was 1000 average citizens picked at random; the large size
was -to make bribery attempts difficult-

The battle was fought at sea, against the Spartans, in a difficult storm.
 The Athenian
navy won, by skill, strength of arms, and clever leadership.

When the 5 generals got back, an orator pursuaded the court that the
generals were
guilty of impiety because they had failed to return the bodies of the
sailors who were lost at sea, in the storm.  The sentence for impiety was
death, and it was carried out immediately.  One general successfully
fled.

A week later, the court repudiated its decision, and mourned the dead
generals.

Sparta took a whole generation to recover, but _won_ the next war. That's
how Athens fell.   A common speculation is that the most intelligent
people no longer wanted to be general.  Another common speculation is
that the orator was an agent of influence paid by  the Spartans.  Of
course, the Athenian court did not have to take his advice.

This might be a rational concern, irrationally described.
Plants resist their predators by manufacturing poisons.
New forms of the poisons, or new combinations, can
easily be toxic to people.

Agreed, but nanocomputers are required for efficient assemblers, and do
not
constitute a new class of invention.  Besides, nanocomputers might be
pretty trivial.  I think all we really need is a good Verilog compiler
for nano-scale systems, and the computer problem is fixed, to a first
approximation.  Motorola can then just compile their current u-controller
source to nanonic form.  We will then have nanonic Power PCs.  We night
not even need new compilers!  Of course later, more optimized processors
are likely, but this would get things moving.

ufog is a distinctly different product, with unique value, and the
possibility to cause major economic and military dislocations. 
Significantly, it is _not_ a medical product, and thus does not fall
under medical regulatory laws, which makes it far less risky than most
transhumanizing technologies.

As for cooperation, the obvious way is to have a ufog description
language, analogous to Postscript, maybe some variant of VRML.  There's
gobs of foglets, but that means there's gobs of processors, too.  One may
as well use them.

By analogy, just think how hard it is to describe all those millions of
dots on the printed page!  How could people ever manage it !?

But the market is powerful.  I read about historical and current anarchic
economic systems that regulate force by means of boycotts: The Law
Merchant did this, and still does.  For example, if a government refuses
to repay foreign loans, my understanding is that currency traders then
boycott that country.  The result is that the country becomes unable to
trade.  Sovereignty is irrelevant.

Likewise, boycotts can sanction merchants and banks, under the
administration of commercial arbiters.

Boycotting sounds lame until you can' t buy food, shelter or ammunition.

Economically, I agree.  Socially, I'm not so sure.  I still see many
problems caused by the goal-free nature of our government.  Our
government, for example, is not even sure that a long life is good, let
alone an intelligent electorate.  What's the likely response to real
transhumans !?

Sure, but wishy-washy forms of utilitarian ethics offer wide appeal with
positive guidance thrown in for free.  E.g. many arguments that
support libertarian reform are- utilitarian, not libertarian.  E.g. when
someone
argues that we should be libertarian because it's more efficient, that's
a utilitarian
argument, because it promises more benefits from less work.  Likewise
when someone promotes an ethical system as more promotable, that's a
variation of the efficiency argument, and thus- utilitarian. 

 I speculate that you might be a closet utilitarian!  Consider yourself
outed!

Libertarian ethics -are- less likely to offend, but they also seem less
flexible at suggesting reforms, precisely because real libertarians are
pinned to a
framework of principles based on a theory of natural rights.  

I think that ethics based on natural rights give base men rhetorical
advantages over honest men.  I think that most people sense natural
rights by sentiment.  Sentiments are real, but can easily be distorted by
rhetoric.  Honest orators won't do this, but base orators will not
hesitate, and a political system based on natural rights is really too
tempting to honest men.

So, to me the whole structure of libertarian ethics looks perilously
flimsy, subject to manipulation by orators.  And, in fact, I think that
this is what happened in the U.S. over the last 200 years.

Rational self-interest, on the other hand, is -much- harder to confuse.

Just an ignorant question here.  Do any of you have specific ideas for
preventing
an interspecific war of extermination between transhumans of different
species, or between humans and transhumans?

It seems to me that the simplest way is to prevent human speciation, but
I'm
willing to be surprised.

Rationality. Why would species A want to get rid of species B (costly
and dangerous), when they can instead trade or cooperate and both get
the benefits? I have a half-written paper about this issue, and it
seems that even wastly different transhuman species or
humans-transhumans have little to gain by attacking each other due to
things like the law of comparative advantage, the stability or
reciprocal cooperation and the likeliehood of having very different
ecological niches. As long as the number or impact of irrational
agents is sufficiently low and there are no "dominant technologies"
that give the wielder total dominance over any non-wielder, this seems
to be stable.

Lack of speciation has never hindred intraspecies wars. But it is
notable that democracies never seem to go to war against each other.

Yet it won't work. Even the Dumbocrats have admitted that their new laws
would have done nothing to stop the school shootings. The list of laws the
killers at Littleton broke is two or three pages long: why would another
one make any difference?

Indeed; DC has pretty much banned gun ownership for decades now, and has
one of the highest murder rates in the world. Numerous countries have
banned guns 'to reduce crime'... it's never worked. Why should this time
be any different?

Joe, you're an utter fucking hypocrite. You're arguing for laws to disarm
people, many of whom will be killed as a consequence, and you complain 
that we're causing anonymous people's deaths.

Which must contribute a whole... oh... maybe 0.1% to the US murder rate.

No, you *REFUSE* to comprehend it. The answer is simple: the government
youth concentration camps are utterly fucked up, and life there for smart
kids is hell. The government has chosen to disarm teachers, so the kids
know that if they go in shooting they'll have no resistance, and the media
love to splash reports of these crimes over the front pages, so they'll
get lots of publicity. Hey, you're a smart kid, you've been shit on all
your life by stupid assholes, now you have a chance to get even and get 
famous. Why not?

Only to those who prefer to push their own agenda rather than solve the
real problems find this incomprehensible. If you still do, how about you 
go and read: http://slashdot.org/articles/99/04/25/1438249.shtml.

Oh, and BTW, since the media outrage against the Littleton shootings,
there have been another four or five around the world. Why aren't you
campaigning to ban media reporting, since the latest shootings almost
certainly wouldn't have happened were it not for the sensationalist
news reports?

After pointing out that he would kill those who opposed his laws, Joe
said:

Pot. Kettle. Black. Feeling that righteous pride yet, Joe?

The defence rests.

Been there, done that.
It sucks!!!
I lucked out and got 6 mo.. shock (w/o ratting) during that time I was
beaten, saw 2 murders and mentally brutalized in a way that's hard to
imagine unless you've had it happen to you.
Prisons are by far the most barbaric aspect of our culture and the
excuses used to keep them full the most pathetic.

Really, it has gotten better.  I've met the chief of regulations for
the FAA's AST, Manuel Vega, and he's one of those rare creatures- a
bureaucrat with dedication, intelligence, and a sense of duty.  I
doubt if we'll need more than two full-time staff to take care of
all the paperwork for licensing (in addition to a little time by a
bunch of others including myself).  Space launch vehicles pack a lot
of energy into a small package, and are inherently dangerous to
innocent bystanders.  I've seen the NPRM for RLV's and it's not
onerous- certainly not even a thousand pages to comply.

I've been a member of self-policing organizations like the US
Parachute Association, and while I am a libertarian, a bit of
organization does help make things run smoother (as in Heinlein's
quote on good manners).

Anyway, I don't see the FAA seriously getting in the way of me
personally participating in spaceflight (in about a year if things
continue to go well).

Dear Matt,

Please circulate this web site for those of us caught up in "Postalgate,"
Clinton's latest attack upon personal privacy.

I spoke with "Joe" at Congressman Ron Paul's office this afternoon, and he
stated that the Mailbox Privacy Protection Bill has been sent to committee
for rapid consideration.  Under the 1996 Contract With America, Joe said
that in situations such as this, where an agency has passed oppressive
regulations, Congress can approve a bill in 60 days to erase those
regulations.  Given the fact there were 8,000 opposition letters and only 10
letters supporting this outrageous invasion of privacy, the people
responsible for enacting these regulations against the will of the people
should be FIRED!

Yours in Liberty,
Karen Grumm

Feel better?

You can lead a horse to water, but you can't faucet.

All the silly laws in the world won't stop gun violence, no law has
any effect unless it's enforced, and the record clearly shows gun
laws are not enforced.

Require trigger locks? Big deal, you may have to sell them, but
compliance with using them will be near zero.

By the way the NRA has always supported safe storage of guns.

Chicago, handguns have been illegal since 1982 (unconstitutional)
the murder capitol of the U.S. Prosecution for illegal possession
near zero.

The feds claim thousands of felons were stopped from buying guns
under the brady bunch act.....prosecutions, near zero.

I live just outside Chicago, (20' to be exact) guns are legal here
and there is no problem.

Illinois law requires every gun owner to have a FOID (firearm
owners I.D.) which requires a background check. No gun may be sold
or transfered without a check for a valid FOID and the record of
any transactions must be kept for ten years.

Chicago is having problems with "strawbuyers", those who purchase
multiple guns and resell them to gang members. Under current law
these are easy to find and track, prosecution.....you guessed it,
near zero.

So how many of these 5 guns have trigger locks?

Military? Name, rank, serial number please.

By the way by owning 5 guns, you support the gun industry, and I am
unaware of the ads you mention.

The existing gun laws, minus those that are unconstitutional,
(handgun bans, assault weapons ban) are sufficient if enforced.

We will never work together with the antigun folks, their desire is
to eliminate all guns.

I have to go send the NRA a check....

Title
  Structure-activity relationships of flavonoids and the induction of
  granulocytic- or monocytic-differentiation in HL60 human myeloid leukemia
  cells.
Source
  Bioscience, Biotechnology & Biochemistry.  62(11):2199-204, 1998 Nov.
Abstract
  The flavones apigenin and luteolin strongly inhibited the
  growth of HL60 cells and induced morphological differentiation into
  granulocytes. The flavonol quercetin inhibited the cell growth and induced a
  differentiation marker, i.e., NBT reducing ability. However quercetin-treated
  cells were not morphologically differentiated into granulocytes. The chalcone
  phloretin weakly induced NBT reducing ability and a marker of monocytic
  differentiation alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase activity in the cells.
  Quercetin and phloretin appeared to induce the differentiation of HL60 cells
  into monocytes. The proportion of alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase-positive
  cells induced by genistein was less than that of the NBT-positive cells. Some
  of the nuclei in genistein-treated HL60 cells morphologically changed.
  Genistein must have induced both granulocytic and monocytic differentiation
  of HL60 cells. The flavonols galangin and kaempferol, which had fewer
  hydroxyl group(s) in the B-ring than quercetin, and the flavanone naringenin
  inhibited the growth but did not induce the differentiation of HL60 cells.

  Luteolin-rich artichoke extract protects low density
  lipoprotein from oxidation in vitro.
Source
  Free Radical Research.  29(3):247-55, 1998 Sep.
Abstract
  Flavonoids represent a diverse group of phytochemicals which possess the
  capacity to act as antioxidants in vitro. This study examined the free
  radical scavenging properties of a luteolin-rich artichoke
  extract and some of its pure flavonoid constituents by assessing their
  ability to prevent Cu2+-mediated LDL oxidation. Artichoke extract retarded
  LDL oxidation in a dose-dependent manner as measured by a prolongation of the
  lag phase to conjugated diene formation, a decrease in the rate of
  propagation and a sparing of endogenous LDL alpha-tocopherol during
  oxidation. The pure aglycone, luteolin (1 microM),
  demonstrated an efficacy similar to that of 20 microg/ml artichoke extract in
  inhibiting lipid peroxidation. Luteolin-7-O-glucoside, one
  of the glycosylated forms in the diet, also demonstrated a dose-dependent
  reduction of LDL oxidation that was less effective than that of
  luteolin. Studies of the copper-chelating properties of
  luteolin-7-O-glucoside and luteolin suggest
  a potential role for chelation in the antioxidative effects of artichoke
  extract. Overall, the results demonstrate that the antioxidant activity of
  the artichoke extract relates in part to its constituent flavonoids which act
  as hydrogen donors and metal ion chelators, and the effectiveness is further
  influenced by their partitioning between aqueous and lipophilic phases.

  Intestinal absorption of luteolin and
  luteolin 7-O-beta-glucoside in rats and humans.
Source
  FEBS Letters.  438(3):220-4, 1998 Nov 6.
Abstract
  In this study, we investigated the intestinal absorption of
  luteolin and luteolin 7-O-beta-glucoside in
  rats by HPLC. The absorption analysis using rat everted small intestine
  demonstrated that luteolin was converted to glucuronides
  during passing through the intestinal mucosa and that
  luteolin 7-O-beta-glucoside was absorbed after hydrolysis to
  luteolin. Free luteolin, its conjugates and
  methylated conjugates were present in rat plasma after dosing. This suggests
  that some luteolin can escape the intestinal conjugation and
  the hepatic sulfation/methylation. LC/MS analysis showed that the main
  conjugate which circulates in the blood was a monoglucuronide of the
  unchanged aglycone. Luteolin in propyleneglycol was absorbed
  more rapidly than that in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose. The plasma
  concentration of luteolin and its conjugates reached the
  highest level 15 min and 30 min after dosing with luteolin
  in propyleneglycol, respectively. HPLC analysis also allowed us to
  demonstrate the presence of free luteolin and its
  monoglucuronide in human serum after ingestion of luteolin.

  Effects of flavonoids and vitamin C on oxidative DNA damage to human
  lymphocytes.
Source
  American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.  67(6):1210-8, 1998 Jun.
Abstract
  This study assessed the antioxidant potencies of several widespread dietary
  flavonoids across a range of concentrations and compared with vitamin C as a
  positive control. The antioxidant effects of pretreatment with flavonoids and
  vitamin C, at standardized concentrations (7.6, 23.2, 93, and 279.4
  micromol/L), on oxygen radical-generated DNA damage from hydrogen peroxide
  (100 micromol/L) in human lymphocytes were examined by using the single-cell
  gel electrophoresis assay (comet assay). Pretreatment with all flavonoids and
  vitamin C produced dose-dependent reductions in oxidative DNA damage. At a
  concentration of 279 micromol/L, they were ranked in decreasing order of
  potency as follows: luteolin (9% of damage from unopposed
  hydrogen peroxide), myricetin (10%), quercetin (22%), kaempferol (32%),
  quercitrin (quercetin-3-L-rhamnoside) (45%), apigenin (59%),
  quercetin-3-glucoside (62%), rutin (quercetin-3-beta-D-rutinoside) (82%), and
  vitamin C (78%). The protective effect of vitamin C against DNA damage at
  this concentration was significantly less than that of all the flavonoids
  except apigenin, quercetin-3-glucoside, and rutin. The ranking was similar
  with estimated ED50 (concentration to produce 50% protection) values. The
  protective effect of quercetin and vitamin C at a concentration of 23.2
  micromol/L was found to be additive (quercetin: 71% of maximal DNA damage
  from unopposed hydrogen peroxide; vitamin C: 83%; both in combination: 62%).
  These data suggest that the free flavonoids are more protective than the
  conjugated flavonoids (eg, quercetin compared with its conjugate
  quercetin-3-glucoside, P < 0.001). Data are also consistent with the
  hypothesis that antioxidant activity of free flavonoids is related to the
  number and position of hydroxyl groups.

Title
  Phytoestrogen concentration determines effects on DNA synthesis in human
  breast cancer cells.
Source
  Nutrition & Cancer.  28(3):236-47, 1997.
Abstract
  Thirteen isoflavonoids, flavonoids, and lignans, including some known
  phytoestrogens, were evaluated for their effects on DNA synthesis in
  estrogen-dependent (MCF-7) and -independent (MDA-MB-231) human breast cancer
  cells. Treatment for 24 hours with most of the compounds at 20-80 microM
  sharply inhibited DNA synthesis in MDA-MB-231 cells. In MCF-7 cells, on the
  other hand, biphasic effects were seen. At 0.1-10 microM, coumestrol,
  genistein, biochanin A, apigenin, luteolin, kaempferol, and
  enterolactone induced DNA synthesis 150-235% and, at 20-90 microM, inhibited
  DNA synthesis by 50%. Treatment of MCF-7 cells for 10 days with genistein or
  coumestrol showed continuous stimulation of DNA synthesis at low
  concentrations. Time-course experiments with genistein in MCF-7 cells showed
  effects to be reversed by 48-hour withdrawal of genistein at most
  concentrations. Induction of DNA synthesis in MCF-7 cells, but not in
  MDA-MB-231 cells, is consistent with an estrogenic effect of these compounds.
  Inhibition of estrogen-dependent and -independent breast cancer cells at high
  concentrations suggests additional mechanisms independent of the estrogen
  receptor. The current focus on the role of phytoestrogens in cancer
  prevention must take into account the biphasic effects observed in this
  study, showing inhibition of DNA synthesis at high concentrations but
  induction at concentrations close to probable levels in humans.

Abstract
  Depending on their structure, flavonoids display more or less potent
  inhibitory effects on the growth and proliferation of certain malignant cells
  in vitro, and these effects are thought to be due to inhibition of various
  enzymes. We investigated the inhibitory action of fourteen flavonoids of
  different chemical classes on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase alpha (PI
  3-kinase alpha) activity, an enzyme recently shown to play an important role
  in signal transduction and cell transformation. Of the fourteen flavonoids
  tested, myricetin was the most potent PI 3-kinase inhibitor (IC50 = 1.8
  microM), while luteolin and apigenin were also effective
  inhibitors, with IC50 values of 8 and 12 microM, respectively. Fisetin and
  quercetin, as previously reported, were also found to significantly inhibit
  PI 3-kinase activity. The same flavonoids were also analyzed for inhibition
  of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), intrinsic tyrosine kinase and
  bovine brain protein kinase C (PKC). At elevated doses, some of these
  flavonoids were found to also cause significant inhibition of PKC and
  tyrosine kinase activity of EGF-R. A structure-activity study indicated that
  the position, number and substitution of the hydroxyl group of the B ring,
  and saturation of the C2-C3 bond are important factors affecting flavonoid
  inhibition of PI 3-kinase. They may also play a significant role in
  specificity of inhibition and could help to provide a basis for the further
  design of specific inhibitors of this lipid kinase. Finally, possible
  relationships between the antitumoral properties of these flavonoids and
  their biological activities are discussed.

  Flavonoids, dietary-derived inhibitors of cell proliferation and in vitro

Abstract
  Consumption of a plant-based diet can prevent the development and progression
  of chronic diseases associated with extensive neovascularization, including
  solid malignant tumors. In previous studies, we have shown that the
  plant-derived isoflavonoid genistein is a potent inhibitor of cell
  proliferation and in vitro angiogenesis. In the present study, we report that
  certain structurally related flavonoids are more potent inhibitors than
  genistein. Indeed, 3-hydroxyflavone, 3',4'-dihydroxyflavone,
  2',3'-dihydroxyflavone, fisetin, apigenin, and luteolin
  inhibited the proliferation of normal and tumor cells, as well as in vitro
  angiogenesis, at half-maximal concentrations in the low micromolar range. We
  have previously demonstrated that genistein concentrations in the urine of
  subjects consuming a plant-based diet is 30-fold higher than in subjects
  consuming a traditional Western diet. The wider distribution and the more
  abundant presence of flavonoids in the plant kingdom, together with the
  present results, suggest that flavonoids may contribute to the preventive
  effect of a plant-based diet on chronic diseases, including solid tumors.

  Protective effect of flavonoids on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.
Source
  Toxicology Letters.  92(1):1-7, 1997 Jun 16.
Abstract
  We have examined the effect of alpha G-Rutin and luteolin on
  doxorubicin (DOX) toxicity in mice. In the heart, the lipid peroxide level,
  increased to 1.5 times of the normal level induced by DOX, decreased to the
  normal level after treatment with alpha G-Rutin or luteolin
  (i.p.). Glutathione peroxidase (GSHpx) activity, decreased to 73% of normal
  activity after DOX treatment, was shown to recover by the combined
  flavonoids. The lipid peroxide level in bone marrow cells increased to 5.9
  times of the normal level by DOX treatment, whereas this level in the extra
  bone marrow cells did not change by treatment with DOX. The combination of
  alpha G-Rutin and luteolin with DOX significantly inhibited
  the DOX induced-increment of the lipid peroxide level in bone marrow cells.
  Flavonoids have also reduced the effect of DOX toxicity by oral
  administration. It is suggested that it is possible to reduce DOX toxicity by
  the intake of food including flavonoids. In NADPH-dependent lipid
  peroxidation, alpha G-Rutin and luteolin showed
  concentration-dependent inhibition. Therefore, we considered that the
  reduction effect of DOX toxicity by flavonoids was caused by antioxidative
  action and other effect of the flavonoids.

Title
  Inhibition of the mutagenicity of 2-nitrofluorene, 3-nitrofluoranthene and
  1-nitropyrene by flavonoids, coumarins, quinones and other phenolic
  compounds.

  Food & Chemical Toxicology.  35(3-4):357-72, 1997 Mar-Apr.
Abstract
  When 56 flavonoids, 32 coumarins, five naphthoquinones, 12 anthraquinones and
  five structurally-related compounds were tested for their antimutagenic
  potencies with respect to mutagenicities induced by 2-nitrofluorene (2-NF),
  3-nitrofluoranthene (3-NFA) and 1-nitropyrene (1-NP) in Salmonella
  typhimurium TA98 distinct structure-activity relationships were detected.
  First, the tetracyclic nitroarenes 3-NFA and 1-NP were in general more
  effectively antagonized by potent antimutagenic flavonoids and coumarins than
  the tricyclic 2-NF, while there were only minor differences with quinones.
  Secondly, antimutagenicity of natural compounds of plant origin correlated
  with the aglyconic nature 10 of a total of 15 glycosides were inactive, four
  flavonoid glycosides exerted antimutagenicity but to a distinctly lower
  degree than the corresponding aglycones. Thirdly, within flavonoids,
  coumarins and anthraquinones positive correlations were found between
  antimutagenic potency and the polarity of a molecule with the existence of an
  optimum of activity within flavonols and anthraquinones. However, polarity
  seemed to be unimportant within the chalcone and naphthoquinone series. Among
  flavonoids, the parent compounds flavone and flavanone were inactive, but all
  flavones and many flavonoids with phenolic hydroxyl groups exerted
  antimutagenicity. Antimutagenic potency reached a maximum with the presence
  of four hydroxyl functions-luteolin, kaempferol-though the
  position of hydroxyls was also a determinant of antimutagenic potency.
  Methylation of phenolic hydroxyl groups, however, always reduced
  antimutagenicity. A carbonyl group at carbon 4 was essential for
  antimutagenicity: two catechins and anthocyanidins each were inactive. On the
  other hand, ring C of the flavane nucleus was not essential for
  antimutagenicity: chalcones and dihydrochalcones were potent antimutagens.
  Among coumarins, the parent compound showed antimutagenicity against 1-NP and
  3-NFA, although dihydrocoumarin, methylcoumarins and compounds with bulky
  substituents were inactive. Otherwise, antimutagenic activity depended on the
  presence of polar hydroxyl, amino or carboxyl groups at carbons 3, 4 or 7 but
  was diminished by interactions of hydroxyl groups vicinal to carbon 7. Again,
  antimutagenic potencies were reduced by alkylation or acetylation. Among
  furanocoumarins xanthotoxin exerted strong and bergapten moderate
  antimutagenicity, while psoralen (except against 3-NFA), isopimpinellin and
  the furanochromanones visnagin and khellin were inactive. Among
  anthraquinones, the principles delineated here were valid again, resulting in
  potent antimutagenicity of most phenolic compounds and inactivity of
  anthraquinone itself. Among compounds structurally related to anthraquinones,
  anthrone, acridone and xanthone exerted antimutagenicity, anthrone being the
  most potent one, while thioxanthone and 9-fluorenone were inactive. All
  naphthoquinones were potent antimutagens irrespective of the presence of
  methyl or hydroxyl functions. Plumbagin, 2-methyl-5-hydroxynaphthoquinone,
  however, showed exceptional antimutagenicity.

Abstract
  By means of bioassay-guided separation methods, the cancer cell growth
  inhibitory constituents residing in the bark, stem and leaves of the
  Mauritius medicinal plant Terminalia arjuna (Combretaceae) were examined. The
  cancer cell line active components were found to be gallic acid, ethyl
  gallate, and the flavone luteolin. Only gallic acid was
  previously known to occur in this plant. Luteolin has a well
  established record of inhibiting various cancer cell lines and may account
  for most of the rationale underlying the use of T. arjuna in traditional
  cancer treatments. Luteolin was also found to exhibit
  specific activity against the pathogenic bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

  Radioprotective effects of antioxidative plant flavonoids in mice.
Source
  Mutation Research.  350(1):153-61, 1996 Feb 19.
Abstract
  Radioprotective effects of tea infusions and plant flavonoids were
  investigated by using the micronucleus test for anticlastogenic activity and
  the thiobarbituric acid assay for antioxidative activity. A single gastric
  intubation of rooibos tea (Aspalathus linearis) infusion at 1 ml per mouse 2
  h prior to gama-ray irradiation (1.5 Gy) reduced the frequency of
  micronucleated reticulocytes (MNRETs). After the fractionation of rooibos tea
  infusion, the flavonoid fraction was found to be most anticlastogenic and
  antioxidative. From this fraction, luteolin was isolated as
  an effective component. Then, anticlastogenic effects of 12 flavonoids
  containing luteolin and their antioxidative activities
  against lipid peroxidation by Fenton's reagent were examined. A good
  correlation (r=0.717) was observed between both activities.
  Luteolin showed the most effective potency. A gastric
  intubation of luteolin (10 micromoles/kg) 2 h prior to
  gamma-ray irradiation (6 Gy) suppressed lipid peroxidation in mouse bone
  marrow and spleen and a trend of protective effect of
  luteolin against the decrease of endogenous ascorbic acid in
  mouse bone marrow after gamma-ray irradiation (3 Gy) was observed. These
  results suggest that plant flavonoids, which show antioxidative potency in
  vitro, work as antioxidants in vivo and their radioprotective effects may be
  attributed to their scavenging potency towards free radicals such as hydroxyl
  radicals. Therefore, the flavonoids contained in tea, vegetables and fruits
  seem to be important as antioxidants in the human diet.

Abstract
  We have investigated the antidiabetic activity of luteolin
  5-rutinoside in streptozotocin(STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Treatment for 20
  days with 2 mg/kg increased both pancreatic insulin and DNA content. When
  both luteolin 5-rutinoside (2 mg/kg) and glibenclamide (1
  mg/kg) were administered concurrently to STZ-diabetic rats, a marked
  antidiabetic activity was achieved. This effect was evidenced by a
  significant decrease in glycemia levels (> 50%), a 2.5-fold increase in
  insulin blood levels and an increase in body and pancreas weight, compared to
  the diabetic control group.

Abstract
  The anticlastogenic effect of 12 structurally different flavonoids was
  investigated in whole body gamma-ray irradiated mice. Each flavonoid was
  administered to ICR male mice by a single gastric intubation (5 mumol/kg) 6 h
  before gamma-ray irradiation (1.5 Gy) and the frequency of micronucleated
  reticulocytes (MNRETs) in peripheral blood was determined. In order to
  elucidate the mechanism of the anticlastogenic effect of these flavonoids,
  their antioxidative activities were examined by the thiobarbituric acid
  method using methyl linoleate and Fenton's reagent (Fe2+/H2O2). Of the 12
  flavonoids, luteolin had the most marked effect on reducing
  the frequencies of MNRETs and also inhibiting lipid peroxidation. However,
  quercetin tetramethylether, which has methoxy groups instead of hydroxyl
  groups at the 3,7,3',4'-positions, and phloretin with an open C-ring showed
  the least anticlastogenic and antioxidative activity. A good correlation (r =
  0.717, P < 0.01) was observed between the anticlastogenic activity and the
  antioxidative activity of the 12 flavonoids. These results suggest that the
  radioprotective effect of flavonoids in mice may be attributed to the
  hydroxyl radical scavenging potency in a direct or an endogenous enzyme
  mediated manner.

Abstract
  The effect of dietary supplementation of flavonoidal compounds such as
  quercetin, rutin, luteolin and (+)-catechin on the incidence
  of fibrosarcoma induced by 20-methylcholanthrene (20-MC) in male Swiss albino
  mice was observed. Subcutaneous injection of 20-MC produced 100% tumor
  incidence and the onset of tumor appeared within 7 weeks, while
  flavonoid-treated mice (1% quercetin- and luteolin-mixed
  diets) produced tumors in the 9th week, and the tumor incidences in mice
  treated with quercetin- and luteolin-mixed diets were 52%
  and 60%, respectively. Subcutaneous administration of 20-MC along with the
  flavonoidal compounds (quercetin, luteolin) was found to
  have significant effect on tumor expression. The compounds rutin and
  (+)-catechin did not influence tumor expression in both experiments. Elevated
  levels of lipid peroxides, cytochrome P450 and decreased activity of
  glutathione-S-transferase (GST) were observed in the tumor bearing animals.
  Test-diet-treated animals showed reduction in the lipid peroxides and
  cytochrome P450, and increased activity of GST (P < 0.001). In vitro
  [3H]thymidine incorporation showed the inhibition of DNA synthesis in
  fibrosarcoma cells by the flavonoids. The possible mode of action of the
  flavonoidal compounds may be through their influence on the initiation and
  promotion phases of the carcinogenic process coupled with enhancement of the
  detoxification process.

  Lignans and flavonoids inhibit aromatase enzyme in human preadipocytes.

  Aug.
Abstract
  Lignans and flavonoids are naturally-occurring diphenolic compounds found in
  high concentrations in whole grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables. Seven
  lignans and six flavonoids were evaluated for their abilities to inhibit
  aromatase enzyme activity in a human preadipose cell culture system. The
  lignan, enterolactone (Enl) and its theoretical precursors,
  3'-demethoxy-3O-demethylmatairesinol (DMDM) and didemethoxymatairesinol
  (DDMM) decreased aromatase enzyme activity, with Ki values of 14.4, 5.0 and
  7.3 microM, respectively. The flavonoids, coumestrol,
  luteolin and kaempferol also decreased aromatase enzyme
  activity, with Ki values of 1.3, 4.8 and 27.2 microM, respectively.
  Aminoglutethimide, a pharmaceutical aromatase inhibitor, showed a Ki value of
  0.5 microM. Kinetic studies showed the inhibition by all compounds to be
  competitive. Smaller decreases in aromatase activity were observed with the
  lignan, enterodiol (End) and its theoretical precursors,
  O-demethylsecoisolariciresinol (ODSI), demethoxysecoisolariciresinol (DMSI)
  and didemethylsecoisolariciresinol (DDSI). The flavonoids,
  O-demethylangolensin (O-Dma), fisetin and morin showed no inhibitory effects.
  The inhibition of human preadipocyte aromatase activity by lignans and
  flavonoids suggests a mechanism by which consumption of lignan- and
  flavonoid-rich plant foods may contribute to reduction of estrogen-dependent
  disease, such as breast cancer.

  Effects of gamma-linolenic acid, flavonoids, and vitamins on cytotoxicity and
  lipid peroxidation.

Abstract
  Gamma linolenic acid (GLA), a polyunsaturated fatty acid, promoted lipid
  peroxidation in Raji lymphoma suspension cultures, in a dose (10 microM-100
  microM) and time-dependent (4 h-48 h) manner. The increase in lipid
  peroxidation could be correlated to an increase in cytotoxicity. The plant
  flavonoids (quercetin, luteolin, butein, rutin) and the
  fat-soluble components (retinol, retinoic acid, alpha-tocopherol) by
  themselves did not affect lipid peroxidation in Raji cells. Quercetin,
  luteolin, retinol, and alpha-tocopherol were able to inhibit
  cell proliferation significantly. Although GLA only decreased the
  cytotoxicity of retinol-treated cells, the latter compound was able to block
  the prooxidative action of GLA by scavenging the free radicals induced by it.
  Quercetin at 50 and 100 microM exerted equipotent superoxide anion scavenging
  effects, but at the higher concentration it had no effect on lipid
  peroxidation. Although the bioactive test compounds are well known natural
  antioxidants, interestingly, our data showed that their potent cytotoxic
  actions do not involve free radicals or lipid peroxidation reactions.

Abstract
  1. Flavonoids relaxed the contractions induced by noradrenaline, KCl or
  phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate in rat aortic strips, the order of potency
  being: flavonols (quercetin, kaempferol, pentamethylquercetin) >
  flavones(luteolin, apigenin) > flavanols((+)-catechin,
  (-)-epicatechin) which correlates with the reported order of potency to
  inhibit protein kinase C. 2. The relaxant effects of kaempferol and
  luteolin were slightly potentiated by isoprenaline and those
  of pentamethylquercetin, kaempferol and apigenin by sodium nitroprusside. 3.
  It is concluded that the main vasodilatory mechanism of flavonoids seems to
  be the inhibition of protein kinase C. Inhibition of cyclic nucleotide
  phosphodiesterases or decreased Ca2+ uptake may also contribute to their
  vasodilatory effects.

Abstract
  Sixty-four flavonoids were tested for their antimutagenic potencies with
  respect to IQ in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and in part also towards MeIQ,
  MeIQx, Trp-P-2, and Glu-P-1 and in S. typhimurium TA100. Antimutagenic
  potencies were quantified by the inhibitory dose for 50% reduction of
  mutagenic activity (ID50). A carbonyl function at C-4 of the flavane nucleus
  seems to be essential for antimutagenicity: two flavanols and four
  anthocyanidines were inactive. Again, five isoflavons, except biochanin A,
  were inactive. Within the other groups of 21 flavones, 16 flavonols and 16
  flavanones the parent compounds flavone, flavonol, and flavanone possessed
  the highest antimutagenic potencies (ID50: 4.1, 2.5, 5.5 nmoles). Increasing
  polarity by introduction of hydroxyl functions reduced antimutagenic potency.
  Reducing polarity of hydroxy flavonoids by methyl etherification, however,
  increased antimutagenic potency again. 6-Hydroxy- and 2'-hydroxy substituted
  flavonoids were considerably less potent antimutagens. Of 11 flavonoid
  glycosides tested all compounds except apigenin- and
  luteolin-7-glucoside (ID50:74, 115 nmoles) were inactive or
  only weakly antimutagenic. Rings C and A of the nucleus were not essential
  for antimutagenicity: chalcone and three derivatives were nearly as active as
  comparable flavones while antimutagenicity of benzylidenacetone was
  considerably reduced (ID50: 95 nmoles). Cinnamylaldehyde and cinnamoates,
  however, were inactive. A planar structure in the vicinity of the carbonyl
  group may also be important for antimutagenicity. Flavanones were less potent
  antimutagens than the corresponding flavones, but dihydrochalcones and 14
  structurally related saturated aromatic carbonyl compounds were inactive.
  Fisetin and 6-hydroxyflavone were competitive inhibitors, but
  luteolin was a mixed type inhibitor. The inhibition
  mechanisms of flavone, kaempferol, morin, flavanone, and 2'-hydroxyflavanone
  were concentration dependent, being competitive at low concentrations and
  mixed or non-competitive (2'-hydroxyflavanone) at concentrations about the
  ID50 value. No fundamental differences between the two tester strains and no
  clear influence of mutagen structure on antimutagenic potency could be
  detected.

Abstract
  Effects of the polyphenolic compounds isolated from Lonicera japonica Thunb
  on platelet aggregation, platelet thromboxane biosynthesis and hydrogen
  peroxide-induced endothelial cell injury were studied. With regard to the
  inhibitory effect on human platelet aggregation, methyl caffeate,
  3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid and methyl 3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinate had a strong
  effect. They significantly inhibited the second wave of platelet aggregation
  induced by ADP. Concerning thromboxane biosynthesis triggered by calcium
  ionophore A23187 in platelets, methyl caffeate and methyl
  3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinate had the most potent inhibitory effect. Methyl
  3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinate directly inhibited the conversion of arachidonic
  acid to thromboxane by platelet microsomes, while methyl caffeate did not
  have any significant effect on thromboxane biosynthesis in platelet
  microsomes. In the prevention of hydrogen peroxide-induced endothelial cell
  injury in culture, protocatechuic acid, methyl caffeate, methyl chlorogenic
  acid and luteolin were significantly effective. The
  inhibitory effect on platelet activation and the cytoprotective effect on
  hydrogen peroxide-induced cell injury may explain the possible role of
  polyphenolic compounds isolated from Lonicera japonica Thunb in maintaining
  vascular homeostasis.

Abstract
  The antiperoxidative effects of 35 phenolic compounds, most of them belonging
  to the flavonoid class, were investigated using CCl4-induced peroxidation of
  rat liver microsomes. This system was rather insensitive to gallic acid,
  methyl gallate and ellagic acid. Nevertheless it was inhibited by flavonoids
  and structure/activity relationships were established. The most potent
  compounds were gardenin D, luteolin, apigenin (flavones),
  datiscetin, morin, galangin (flavonols), eriodictyol (flavanone),
  amentoflavone (biflavone) and the reference compound, (+)-catechin. The
  natural polymethoxyflavone gardenin D has shown a potency comparable to that
  of (+)-catechin and higher than that of silybin. Thus, it may be considered
  as a new type of natural antioxidant with potential therapeutical
  applications.

  stimulated with ionophore A23187, either ex-vivo or in-vitro. A similar,
  though less active, mode of action was found with quercitrin, while apigenin
  and luteolin reduced leucocyte accumulation and PGE2

  Bioflavonoid interaction with rat uterine type II binding sites and cell
  growth inhibition.
Source
  Journal of Steroid Biochemistry.  30(1-6):71-8, 1988.
Abstract
  Competition analysis with a number of known bioflavonoids demonstrated that
  these compounds (luteolin, quercetin, pelargonin) compete
  for [3H]estradiol binding to cytosol and nuclear type II sites in rat uterine
  preparations. The inhibition of [3H]estradiol binding to type II sites was
  specific and these bioflavonoids did not interact with the rat uterine
  estrogen receptor. Since estradiol stimulation of nuclear type II sites in
  the rat uterus is highly correlated with cellular hypertrophy and
  hyperplasia, we assessed the effects of these compounds on the growth of
  MCF-7 human breast cancer cells in culture and on estradiol stimulation of
  uterine growth in the immature rat. The data demonstrated that addition of
  quercetin (5-10 micrograms/ml) to MCF-7 cell cultures resulted in a
  dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth (DNA/flask). This effect was
  reversible by removal of quercetin from the culture medium, or by the
  addition of 10 nM estradiol-17 beta to these cell cultures containing this
  bioflavonoid. Since estradiol-17 beta (10 nM) stimulated nuclear type II
  sites and proliferation of MCF-7 cells, we believe bioflavonoid inhibition of
  MCF-7 cell growth may be mediated through an interaction with nuclear type II
  sites. This hypothesis was confirmed by in vivo studies which demonstrated
  that injection of luteolin or quercetin blocked estradiol
  stimulation of nuclear type II sites in the immature rat uterus and this
  correlated with an inhibition of uterine growth (wet and dry weight). These
  studies suggest bioflavonoids, through an interaction with type II sites, may
  be involved in cell growth regulation.

Title
  Antiviral activity of flavones and potentiation by ascorbate.

  Journal of General Virology.  69 ( Pt 7):1749-51, 1988 Jul.
Abstract
  We compared the anti-poliovirus activities of three flavones, quercetin,
  luteolin and 3-methylquercetin, which differ only at ring
  position 3. 3-Methylquercetin was the most potent compound. Quercetin
  exhibited antiviral activity only when protected against oxidative
  degradation by ascorbate. The antiviral activity of luteolin
  was comparable to that of ascorbate-stabilized quercetin.

Title
  Role of flavonoids in suppressing the enhancement of phospholipid metabolism
  by tumor promoters.
Source
  Cancer Letters.  21(1):1-8, 1983 Nov.
Abstract
  Quercetin, a ubiquitous flavonoid in plants, inhibited the incorporation of
  [32P]inorganic phosphate (32Pi) into phospholipid of HeLa cells enhanced by
  12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a potent tumor promoter. Among
  the flavonoids tested, luteolin was the most effective in
  inhibiting the action of TPA. Studies on structure-activity relationships
  demonstrated that more hydroxylated flavones and flavonols had stronger
  inhibitory effects. Quercetin and luteolin also inhibited
  enhancement of 32Pi-incorporation into phospholipid by dihydroteleocidin B,
  another potent tumor promoter. The inhibitory effect of quercetin on the
  biological action of tumor promoters is interesting in relation to the
  non-carcinogenicity of this flavonoid in animals, in spite of its
  mutagenicity.

In support of your position, a BBC article about evidence that
Neanderthals mated with Cro Magnons:

http://news2.thdo.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid%5F323000/323657.stm

This supports the theory that Cro Magnons did not drive Neanderthals to
extinction, but lived side by side.

Question:  Is it normal for a P233 with 64MB of ram to take 59' 16" and 17.1
seconds to complete 43.090% of its first data unit?

I've devoted this computer to the SETI@Home project - soon I'll have a P2
350 with 160MB of ram to spare for it also...

I've added myself to the extropian/transhumanism team, but since I haven't
even completed my first unit yet, I haven't shown up on the list.

Also:  There must be some extropians in NYC somewhere... show yourselves!
I've just learned that I'm being hired down there and that I'll be moving.
I'll need advice and whatnot as I'm just a 19 year old kid fresh out of
college.

You seem to be using a very limited definition of 'private property'.  Water
rights can be a form of private property.  So can broadcasting rights,
intellectual property, stock options, futures contracts, and many other
abstract constructs.

The key feature of private property is that it allows individuals to decide
what is done with a resource.  Any system in which individuals are allowed
to freely own and trade a resource is a private property system.

BTW - I've seen pretty convincing evidence that most of the water problems
in Southern California could be alleviated simply by creating real water
rights.  The major problem right now is that no one is allowed to buy or
sell their water rights without a special OK from the government, which
means that water must be allocated by bureaucratic decree.  Replace the
water regulation boards with a water rights market, and water use would
become both more efficient and more closely aligned with the desires of the
people using it.

When was the last time this list made a decision about anything?  It is a
recreational activity that makes no decisions, allocates no resources, and
produces nothing of monetary value.  Of course we don't need property rights
or a formal market to make it work - we aren't doing any of the things that
those institutions are designed to facilitate.

Again, having a private property system does not mean that all human
activities must be mediated by property rights and markets.  It simply means
that individuals are free to use such methods wherever they wish to do so.
I can give away my thoughts if I wish to do so, or I can try to convince
people to pay for them.  As long as I am the one who makes the decision, our
system is based on private property.

The collectivist alternative would be to have someone else decide how we run
the list.  The socialist middle ground would be to leave some decisions to
us, and have others (usually the 'more important' ones) made by others.

If you want to make a serious proposal out of this, you need to address the
following questions:

1) Who decides how the resources of the group are used?  This covers
everything from where the station is set up to what kind of icing goes on
the desert cakes.

2) Who decides what personal resources each member of the group will enjoy?
Obviously, this is closely related to #1.

3) What happens when someone wants something the above mechanisms don't
allow them to have?  Don't tell me it won't happen - the only way to prevent
it is to have infinite resources, and even nanotech can't give you that.

4) If a new member joins the group, what happens to their property?

5) If someone leaves the group, what do they get to take with them?

Until you address these issues, we don't have a concrete enough proposal to
examine in any realistic fashion.

I refer you to the same list of questions.  If you answer a question with
"The computers decide.", then you need to explain who programs the computers
and how they make their decisions.

Even the most socialist of economists would not make this claim, and for
good reasons.  It is not even remotely feasible to model a modern economy
with existing computer systems - the volume of data that you would have to
process is far larger than even the most massive computer system could hope
to handle.  I can go into detail if you want.

But beyond that, building a computer that can model your own economy is a
self-contradictory goal.  Remember, those same computers are part of the
economy you want to model - they trade stock, process orders, manage
factories, and so on.  As our computers improve we find more complicated
ways to use them, which makes the economy more complex and more difficult to
model.

Also, sheer computer power is not the main obstacle.  The biggest problem is
that you need information that can't be collected.  In order to make the
best possible decisions about how to allocate resources, you would have to
know the preferences of every human being in the economy.  Otherwise you end
up making what the central committee wants, which rarely has anything to do
with the actual desires of the people.  (And please note that simply voting
isn't good enough - just because 60% of the population prefers chocolate ice
cream does not mean we should stop producing the other flavors.)

Of course not.  Only the most rabid of cranks would make that claim - it
certainly isn't something that your average libertarian (or even your
average anarcho-capitalist) would agree with.

The basis of a market system is the idea that individuals should be allowed
to set up whatever arrangements they find mutually agreeable.  In most cases
they will choose to stick with property and markets, but if a group decides
to pool their property into some kind of communal arrangement that is
perfectly OK.

What some of us consider "evil" is when some outside agency gains the power
to dictate to individuals how they must handle their affairs.

Yes, a borganism probably doesn't need property in the conventional sense.
It will need some kind of internal accounting and prioritization mechanisms,
but they will probably be very different from anything humans use.

However, unless everyone is assimilated by the borganism you haven't
resolved the question.  How does the borganism relate with other independent
entities, be they humans, individual SIs or other borganisms?

This is possible only because the traders are able to hide behind the
military power of other sovereign states.  Notice that such things only
happen in *international* trade - if you live within the territory that a
government controls, it will use force to prevent you from doing anything it
doesn't like.

Probably not; my 450/128MB takes around 32 hours per unit... except that
the software seems to be buggy so it rarely gets a unit done in that
time. I left it running over the weekend and came back to discover a nice
little dialog box asking me whether to connect to upload the results, and
to configure the program to connect automatically if I didn't want to see
the dialog box again... of course I'd already configured this once, and it
worked perfectly with the first unit it finished. That wasted about forty
hours of CPU time.

Last night Windows got some kind of network error around midnight and so
the machine was sitting there waiting for me to click on the stupid dialog
box that Windows put up, wasting another 12 hours or so of CPU time. Ah,
the wonders of crappy Microsoft software...

Oh, and apparently it runs a lot faster if you minimize the window.

I'm running the program on a Mac G3 233  at 64 megs of RAM and I've so
far completed 4 units, none taking more than 22+ hrs and one
taking 17+ hours.  If you go to the SETI@home stats page you'll see
that Macs are consistently producing faster than Windows, though Unix
beats both handily.

I'm interested in clarifying something here. You have stated that you
are anti-government, and from the above you are also supportive of a
punitive (rather than rehabilitative) styles of prisons. I've got no
argument with someone holding these opinions, although I don't hold them
myself. There's some kind of common ground probably, because I wonder
whether there can really be a rehabilitating prison, and I imagine that
you would have some opinions on this subject.

The way I see it, if you don't trust the government, then you probably
want to have prisons which aren't too awful, because there would be a
fairly high chance of innocent people ending up there. Is this
fallacious reasoning? Do you see a seperation between the government and
the justice system which is relevant (ie: justice system is trustworthy,
government is not)?

I don't mean this post to be inflammatory (although it probably is). I'm
just interested in this juxtaposition of views.

that the ufog designs involved inert foglets with silicon(?) shells;
maybe they should be made vulnerable to the chemicals released by
lymphocytes or other cells. Maybe some connectors made of protein, for
example.

By the time ufog is a reality, wouldn't most people be chock full of
tiny little (nano) robots which collected debris in the lungs / poisons
in food / any other unruly stuff, and got rid of it? Why not, instead of
trying to make ufog safe to digest, design a nano-robot scavenger that
catches debris and takes it out of harm's way?

The only common ground is that the population of criminals we are
discussing has been produced by a social welfare state in a mercantilist
economy. That qualifies my opinion quite a bit. In the kind of world I
would like, criminals would get what they deserve at the crime scene at
the hands of the people they sought to victimize. Eventually the genes
for criminal tendencies would be weeded out of the population by natural
selection. Non-violent offenders would pay the costs of their crimes in
non-violent ways (IMHO, imprisoning a human being is a violent act).
Obviously this calls for a population of citizens who are fare more
interested in personal sovereignty and responsibility than the current
one.

So long as the jury pool is made up of responsible intelligent,

Sorry to butt in on a tangent, but who or what is the Rotary Rocket
company? I must cave in finally to the desire to know what a Rocket
Plumber is, also.

Also, if you have to choose between never going into space and manning
the a prototype, well, go for it! Either you'll go to space (SPACE!) or
get a Darwin Award. Either way, it's fame. And, you'll have an excuse
for never getting around to Cryonics.

The logic is that the men of Rotary Rocket are men who still beleive
that a milestone is only a milestone when it is passed with a man in the
cockpit. My hats are off to them. Besides that, the first roton will be
little more than a funny looking helicopter. An autogyro is one of the
simplest lifting devices known.

It's my understanding that no genetic link has ever been found for
criminal behavior; indeed, if there were, Australia wouldn't be one of the
most law abiding nations in the world. (Please correct me if I've missed
something; in particular, I wouldn't be surprised if there is a gene for
sociopathy.)

There is, however, an established correlation between corporal punishment
of children and later criminal behavior.  

In the US, there is an available adoptive home for every child currently
in foster care, but the law currently will not permit adoption as long as
there is a ghost of a chance that an abusive or addicted parent might,
some day, be able to care for a child.  Allowing children to get out of
the notorious foster care system sounds like a good start for preventing
crime.

Nothing spectacularly new here; basically companies ("sponsors")
will offer cash to programmers to get a specific piece of
software coded. It lets companies get around the hassles of
hiring contract workers, and lets part-time or other types
of programmers make some money they might not otherwise make.

1. The percentage of "criminal genes" in Australia is minutely different to
that in most UK-derived countries. You are talking about some thousands of
people, many not criminal, over a hundred years ago in a country which has
more non-native citizens than (I understand) any other country.

2. Abidance of Laws has to do with what laws you have, what laws you
enforce, how you enforce them, and how easy it is to live without stealing
(welfare). All of these need to be understood before one can make between-
country comparisons with any meaningfulness.

Gee- I wonder children with anti-social personality disorder (the single
most valid predictor of latter criminal activity) might actually elicit more
punishment from adults surrounding the mayhem they create? There are also
real data on this question.

I think we must be careful about making assumptions about when
different applications of nanotechnology become viable, I have noted
that a lot of people seem to think that once we have an assembler just
about everything will be built in a short order. I don't think so.

Nanoimmune systems are of course a very good idea, and I would guess
medical nanotech will be one of the first major applications (depite
all the restrictions, medical technology is a very profitable business
and the transfer from basic research to application is fairly well
streamlined). Most likely they will be in place before the ufog, even
if they are crude. However, dealing with debris in the lungs and food
is already done by macrophages and their intestinal counterparts; my
guess it is a good idea to design the ufog to manageable by them
rather than assuming everybody will have a nanoimmune system.

I can't speak for them, but this isn't another space shuttle; as I understand
it, since the Roton is a reusable SSTO the prototype vehicle will be
extensively tested with short and suborbital flights before they go for the
first orbital launch. Also, doesn't it have an ejection system for the crew?

Look over the paper

Safety and the Roton Development Program, IEEE 99-063 445

available at:

http://www.rotaryrocket.com/new/content-docs.html 

It gives an overview of the developement program and 
covers their reasoning behind a manned vehicle.

Short story is:

A.  If you look at all types of aircraft, manned systems are
orders of magnitude more reliable than unmanned as well as being 
cheaper to develope.  

B.  The Roton is aerodynamically stable in all flight regimes,
so it is possible for all abort situations to be flown manually.
This is *much* less expensive that trying to develope an automated
abort or writing off the vehicle every time something goes wrong,
Since it is impossible for a programmmer to forsee all possible
problems, it is also much safer.

C.  The roton is incrementally flight tested, starting with short 
hovers and gradually expanding the velocity and altitude flight
by flight until orbit is achieved.  This is how a conventional
aircraft is tested, is much safer than the current "all or nothing"
method, and is extremely difficult or impossible to automate.  
Even teleoperation introduces questionable time lags and greatly 
increased costs.

D.  The FAA regulations are much friendlier to manned than unmanned
craft.  For some reason, they seem to feel that a person can 
exercise better judgment in an emergency than a machine.  

It seem to me that all this leads to a vehicle that, while not as
safe as a commercial airliner or even a military craft, will be
orders of magnitude safer than the converted artillary pieces we
use today.  Even in flight test, due to incremental test, it may
be safer.  It is certainly true that, for the pilot, it is
much safer to stay home in bed, but is it really worth hundreds
of millions of dollars in extra costs?  And *added* risk to the
public?  When there are test pilots lined up around the block 
willing to fly it?

Each borganism has its own consciousness, and would therefore act like a
single individual with many bodies.  The details of such a society would be
very different from anything we've seen before, but the basic questions
about how resources are to be controlled would remain.  Thus, a society of
borganisms could use anything from a pure free market to absolute
collectivism.

Which begs the question: would a borganism entirely made up of individualists be schizophrenic or have multiple personality disorder?

And in the borganism society some of course argue that collectivism is
an infringement on their rights and that individuality as a borganism
is very important for freedom. :-)

Hmm, an Objectivist borg? "We are Ayn of Rand, resistance is futile..." :-)

The nutshell answer is, unmanned aerial vehicles fail about 2000
times more often than manned vehicles, basically for lack of a human
on the spot to make the right decision in an emergency.  Several
things make Roton amenable to manual backup control-

* Passive aerodynamic stability
* Very limited thrust vector control (possible due to stability)
* Ghod's own control moment gyro

We intend to have a crew on every flight, including revenue flights
to orbit.  This makes the FAA *much* happier... Roton will be a
manned vehicle, not a man-rated vehicle.  (Also, helicopters are a
real bear to land on autopilot, and Roton will have some kinda
squirrely flying characteristics.)

Lastly, I'm the primary test and operations engineer.  If I'm not
willing to fly on the vehicle, nobody should be.

As long as humans are connected with a physical state of existence, there will
be interaction with three dimensional objects (property). As long as humans live
in societies, there will be a need for delineation of private vs. public
property rights.

Under current conditions of supply and demand gaps, the rational focus should be
on maximizing production capabilities. History has shown democratic-capitalistic
societies to be the most productive at the same.

Under future conditions of unlimited production capability, the focus should
shift toward maximizing satisfaction, which is a personal choice. There could be
communities with varying levels of private vs. public property ownership,
whereby each individual could reside in a community that suits their preference.

I personally would prefer a community that respects the sanctity of individual
toothbrush ownership.

Cheers,

"We are all following our own free will in this."
"No, we're not!"
"Silent, collectivist!" 
:-)

Actually, I think you can be a healthy borganism of individualists,
the trick is only to make the good for the individuals identical with
the good of the group. I guess the Web in _EarthWeb_ is a bit like
this: a lot of independent, individual people acting as a group mind
for their own and the world's profit.

See http://www.rotaryrocket.com

...and a rocket plumber is a self-deprecating propulsion engineer. 
In many ways, a rocket combustor is a glorified shower head.  Of
course shower heads don't melt down if you make a mistake turning
the valves...

Hey, I've been shot at and missed, shat at and hit (the joys of
infants and parenthood), been blown up, burned, and broken my back
(twice).  Flying on a rocket should be right up my alley... and I am
signing up with Alcor, I just have to get one set of papers
notarized and I'm set. Folks at the office were joking about getting
me a special spacesuit with a built-in guillotine and a liquid
nitrogen bottle.  Nice to know they care...

Well, I'm baffled. If you mean that we can't be a 'real race of Beings'
until we become a Borganism, that's particularly baffling, as we can't 
simultaneously be a single Borganism and a 'race of Beings'.

...well, seems my definition of a borganism is *very* flexible : the
interactions between the constitutive elements don't need to be "strong"...
I already consider the whole earth as a borganism for example. If another
definition, probably more accurate, is prefered here, I will be pleased to
use your convention ;)......

I was not suggesting that we have to transform the humanity the Star Trek
way...Still I would be somewhat happy to see one day humanity absorb whole
solar systems for technological purposes ;)...I was just screaming by habbit
that I'm ashamed by the fact we have so few strong and global valuable
projects (the usual ones : for memory : solar system exploitation, to try to
save the human culture of very potential extinction, life extension, medical
research, end famine,...etc...etc...)

The I.S.S. for example seems a very bad joke to me...

I oppose the rampant irresponsibility I see in the cynical promotion

2 things:

1) Seems to me I recall Hofstadter doing a whole dialog on the very subject in
Godel, Escher, Bach. An ant colony that, when communicated with as a whole, was a
rabid free-market libertarian, even though it was composed of utterly selfless
collectivists (ants). Hofstadter was making an obvious parallel to us being
composed completely of cells that, before they mutated to adapt to this
collection they find themselves within, were quite separate individual creatures.

2) If one were to view the former Soviet Union as a (very nasty) (proto)
borganism, didn't they argue exactly this, that individual rights (national
soverignity) at the level of the borganism was very important? That was the
rhetoric anyways, as I recall.

See what I mean?  It's meaningless irrational emotional bullshit
like that that costs gun-banners any hope of credibility.  They
keep pointing to the problem with tearful rhetoric about dead kids
without even the faintest clue that anything they do will actually
work, and then they villify as evil anyone with the temerity to
even suggest that they might be wrong.  The press makes things
worse by highlighting the rare and spectacular incidents like this
while completely ignoring the thousands of occasions where guns
quietly served their purpose.

Please keep it up though.  The more and more banners rant, the
more rational people can see that the NRA is the one arguing with
integrity and reason, and that it is HCI and ilk who are the
"extremists".

...or maybe it's just evidence that he has sufficient IQ to know
that laws are just words, and won't prevent someone from becoming
a killer any more than "Just say no" ended the drug problem.
I could as easily argue that for you to propose laws without any
evidence that those laws will protect more people than they harm
is also criminally irresponsible.

I, like most who support the right to use appropriate defense
technologies, am most enraged by the suggestion that we somehow
approve of their misuse, or don't want to reduce their misuse.
Continuing to imply that we do is willfully dishonest, and will
not help your arguments.  Continuing to argue about motives is
a waste of time.

Gun banners may achieve some small measure of credibility when
they show that they are able to argue rationally and honestly.

It is us/them with the anti-gun crowd, they want the total
elimination of all guns, period.

Here in Illinois we have FOID cards (Fire owner I.D.) which
requires a background check, plus an Instacheck every time a
purchase is attempted. There are criminal penalties for transfering
a gun to a noncard member, and a record of all transactions must be
kept for ten years. There is a one day waiting period for long
guns, and three days for a handgun. Very reasonable. NRA approved.

What we really need is the Supreme court to quit chickening out on
the issue and rule that the right to keep and bear arms is an
individual right. Then we can have the currently unconstitutionial
laws abolished (handgun ban, assault weapons ban) and pass
reasonable federal legislation.

As you well know, and as I have already stated, such propositions 
can ONLY be tested experientially.  As I have also stated, to 
demand evidence while not allowing the gathering of it (by 
provisionally passing such laws to see if they DO reduce gun 
murders) is reminiscent of the DEA's intellectually 
dishonest strategy of saying there's no evidence to support the use 
of marijuana as a palliative, and by the way, we won't approve any 
studies to allow you to get any.

Gun nuts may achieve some small crumb of credibility and stop

chanting their mantras with zealous and flat-eyed fervency when 
they end the true-believer practice of dogmatically rejecting every 
suggestion out-of-hand, or perhaps (gasp!) even marshalling the

with the problem (What dead kids?  I don't see any dead kids!

That is what I and every other gun owner has been saying for years. The government passes new gun control laws to make it more difficult and costly for law abiding people like me to buy  guns, yet they never prosecute the criminals who break the laws. Did you know of the supposed 200,000 'criminals' that the Brady Bill supposedly prevented from buying guns at gunshops, less than ten have ever been prosecuted, even though the Brady Bill makes attempted puchasing by a felon a federal felony? Did you know that in 95% of violent crime prosecutions, the prosecutors either fail to charge or dismiss the weapons charges on a plea?

None has been done because lock purchase requirements have not been in existence up to now. You can ask for references that don't exist. Its just common sense. Its also common sense that the law requiring trigger locks is so stupid that it says nothing against the gun buyer turning around and selling the gun lock back to the gun dealer...

Wrongo, it is now Chicago. It used to be Wasington DC, which is now number two. Chicago is number one because of one reason: A group of corrupt cops was selling guns and ammo to gangsters, and tipping them off to undercover cop identities and upcoming busts. Chicago used to have a murder rate of less than 600 per year since 1980. As soon as Mayor Daley took office the rate shot up to over 900 per year and has stayed there.

Mayor Daley would much rather avoid responsibility by blaming his lack of enforcement on the gun manufacturers. He hopes it will be more lucrative.>

If you have no kids, then I would suggest that you use a magnetic police type lock on it if you are so concerned, because those locks are notoriously slow to get off, which eliminates the gun's value as a self defense weapon.

I was raised the same way, and despite being picked on mercilessly as a child, I was more scared of the butt whooping I'd have gotten from my father if I touched his guns than any criminal penalties for using them on my classmates.

Good, call your Democrat congressmen and your local mayors and prosecutors. I'll bet they blow you off or give you the old glad-handing and don't do anything about it. They like to keep crime problems around because they need to complain about it and engender public support for more laws so they can show that they are doing their jobs.

I don't mind the background check under the Insta-check system, except that the FBI and ATF are violating the law in holding onto the records for up to 18 months. The record of the check on an individual is supposed to be erased immediately after it is done. They are using the system as a gun registration system that is unconstitutional and that has repeatedly failed to pass any congressional committee vote. The reason any reasonable person is opposed to a registration system is the potential for abuse. The Nazi's passed their weapons law with such a system and used it to seize the guns of all of the Jews before they shipped them off to the concentration camps. Keep in mind that the Gun Control Act of 1968 is a word for word translation of the Nazi Weapons Law of 1936, minus the registration system.

Moreover, being required to register a gun is what is called a prior restraint on the 2nd amendment. Any prior restraint on a constitutional right is looked on by the Supreme Court as the most objectionable infringement on a constitutional right and is to be rejected outright by the court. Prior restraint infringements can be facially challenged in the court, meaning you don't have to have 'standing' as being victimized under the bad law, because the law offends your rights from the outset.

When these so-called 'reasonable people' state in public that they think the total elimination of guns is a 'reasonable' goal, then co-operation is not possible, as such people are outright traitors to the Constitution. Handgun Control, Inc. and most of the lawyers involved in these gun manufacturer lawsuits, as well as Vice President Gore and candidate Bill Bradley have all said this at least once or twice, if not on a regular basis.

Have you read his speech to the Harvard Law School? I'm actually quite pissed at the NRA right now, and am considering canceling my membership for their acquiescence to the current round of opression. However I am confident that the ban on private gun sales at gun shows will be thrown out of court as an unconstitutional imposition of congress upon intrastate trade.

What I'd like to see is a law imposing equal penalties on parents for their children's crimes. I think you'll start seeing some parents pulling their heads out then.

Joe, the girlfriend who bought the two guns at the show had NO criminal record, so she would have passed a background check. So the law is useless as it pertains to Littleton repeats. Get it?

Flow to and from where? There are 200 million guns here, everywhere, right now. If they banned the manufacture of new guns, they still couldn't stop the black market distribution of the guns that are already out there in the criminal economy. When guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.

90% of violent crime is commited by criminals ON OTHER CRIMINALS. So who is being the nimrod? Its not the gun that makes you immature and sociopathic, idiot. Criminals have that to begin with. Pull your head out.

Yes, and if schools were not the only place in America from which guns are banned, then those murderers would not have been so confident that they could get away with what they did.

I know of at least two teachers I had in school in the 80's who carried, and I am sure there were more I did not know about.

Now that is a good start. Thats the first time I have heard an anti-gun nut actually admit that that was a problem.

When I was in high school in the 80's, we had a wave phenomenon like this too, only it
was suicide. In one year the incidence of teen age suicide popped up by some huge
factor. The reason is because kids who were in need of help saw how much attention
those kids who tried to kill themselves did, and how much their peers expressed how
much they cared for the students who did kill themselves, and they wanted that
attention too. At some point it got old and everyone said how much of a loser such and
so was to kill themselves, and the wave stopped.

The homicide wave has been going on all thru the 90's, but up till this year it was
mostly just in minority schools, so it was attributed to gang violence. It is far
harder now for a kid to get a gun than when I was in school. In fact, I took my hunter
safety course at school (they won't offer it anymore). You can't blame it on the guns.

Am I supposed to feel like an evil human being because I put
more faith in black-and-white numbers from a responsible study
than in the lament of some sobbing mother?  Well, then, I'll
just have to accept that.  My children will have to live with
the consequences of what I do, not with how I feel.  Sorrow
won't accomplish anything.  If that makes me inhuman, then
that's one more reason to desire to become transhuman--perhaps
a better-designed being won't be so distracted by emotional
reactions from making the right choices.

Wow, some actual transhuman/extropian content on this thread!

keeping them out of irresponsible hands.  Chanting your robotic

There was a guard with a gun there; he didn't stop them.  They 
engaged in a running gun battle with him and were not hit. He was 
always there, so they had to know about him, and his armed 
presence was obviously no deterrent.  Chuck Heston made the 
same assumptive mistake you just did, and he later issued a 
retraction and an apology.

Anecdotal, assumptive and particular.  In other words, you can't tell 
me when and where in our history teachers _routinely_ toted guns 
in school (because it ain't never happened), but didn't wanna admit 
as much.

Many gun nuts were bullied when they were kids, and now widely 
advertize their packing of "equalizers" as a compensatory reaction, 
even though the need for protection from physical threat is much 
smaller in day-to-day adult life than it is for schoolkids.  A useful 
side-effect of such a zero tolerance policy would possibly be a 
reduction in the conditioning of future gun nuts (oh, the NRA's 
gonna oppose it now!).

"While it is not true that all conservatives are stupid people, it is 
nevertheless undeniable that practically all stupid people are 
conservative."  John Stuart Mill
Few people who possess guns will shoot innocents, but all 
innocents shot will be shot by people possessing guns.  Knowing 
this, it is in society's best interest to restrict gun possession to 
responsible individuals.

Actually, there was no guillotine in them.  It was whole body.
At least, this was how it was in the English translation.

But the concept should not be taken as a joke.  The point
in the novel was to have a last chance at life if the pilot of
the walker (diglator) was in grave danger.

The Swiss company Swatch recently defined the Biel 
meridian time, dividing the day in one kilobeat (1 beat=1.44 min), 
taking the city of Biel, Switzerland, as a point of reference.

Unlike just using using the timer output of a GPS receiver 
(which lets you synchronize systems at +/- 1 us precision
anywhere on the globe) to nudge a largish counter by 1 s 
ticks, the new scheme seems to catch on.

However, the hardcore transhumanist nuts among us intend to live 
(almost) literally forever (shedding several snake skins along 
the way, and going to some very distant very exotic places), so 
this won't quite do. We need to define our very own extropian, 
transhumanist time standard (>HTS) capable of both reaching down 
into very shallow time of nucleonic and subnucleonic processes 
(to be able to say hello to pulsar Steve) and up to the deep 
time of astrophysical processes (see Diana, who is all over 
Magellanic clouds yonder). At the same time the standard, 
or a subset of it has to be usable to us-current. Tough, eh?

Making the counter to be binary makes obvious sense. Since  
extending a binary counter register by one bit doubles the 
time to wraparound, one can obviously prevent an *observable* 
wraparound even if counting in Planck time unit increments, 
while using a counter of relatively modest size. (Thanks, 
no y2g bug for me). Of course no physical counter is going 
to resolve Planck time quanta, ever, so we need to cheat 
a little, and increment in chunks the current physical 
implementation can handle, while maintaining a migration
path to next generation technology. Semiconductor counters 
will eventually handle up to ~100 GHz, those from hypothetical 
nucleonic matter a lot more, <insert your favourite lunatic 
fringe tech here> a couple of orders of mangnitude more, so 
we'd better reserve a big security margin. Since impact of 
spacetime curvature is already apparent with nuclear time 
etalons sitting a few 100 m apart even in Earth's shallow 
gravitational gradient, we must obviously compensate. Let's 
define the reference clock for absolutely flat spacetime, 
and introduce realtime correction feedback loop to it using 
input from a spacetime curvature sensor. (Further design 
refinement? Don't bother me with boring implementation 
details, d00d.)

As to the utilized coding, I'm not sure that binary is 
best: obviously there are problems with propagating overflow 
bits around in a relativistic context, so something with 
Hamming distance one at each tick might make more sense. 
Gray code? Any other codings where the flips are local? Any
arithmetics defined on them?

For the sake of illustration, let's represent the counter in 
hexadecimal notation: one cypher/nybble (4 bit). As a trivial 
example, consider the next generation of Sony game engines which
can natively handle 128 bit integers.

As a more compact representation, this can be written as a 
hexadecimal (base16: 0123456789abcdef) number: for instance 

	0xdeadbeefd00df00f4711affe29997924

Let's say the rightmost bit has a temporal resolution of 1 THz
(thus allowing some slack for the next CPU generations to come), 
while the CPU itself runs at 256 MHz. We thus must obviously
increment in 4-digit strides (i.e. skipping four leftmost digits, 
piping the clock into the 16th bit)

All this is qualitative (I've cheated, using powers of two at the beginning, 
then going to decimal orders of magnitude, but all this is just for the
sake of illustration, anyway).

With a layout similiar to the above we can visualize the time in a spatial scheme:

	deep time				shallow time
	xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
	||||||||| |||| ||||   ||||||||| ||||||  |||||||||  ||||||||
	nevernever cosmological	human	machine	subnucleonic ridiculous		
	time       time scale	window	time	time	     time

Of course one needs to extend a positioning service as well. GPS is
geocentric, we might use atomic clock beakons to establish solar
navigation service and pulsars as a galactic-wide sources.

All this only 1/2 tongue-in-cheek.

You can lead a liberal to wisdom, but you can't stop his bleeding heart.

Who gets to decide who is responsible and who is not? All men are created equal, are they not? So today the standard is a felony criminal record. Tomorrow liberals will make conservative opinions into felony crimes. What part of "shall not be infringed" don't you understand?

Joe, that law is already on the books. Its one of the ones they violated. It didn't seem to stop them, now, did it?

Suicides and wives killing their abusive husbands, plus rapes (without guns) and others. Most gun killings happen at point blank up to a ten yard range. That is NOT long distance.

He was not a guard, but a deputy who was there to check on one of those kids. Besides, they still outgunned him, one man. I'm talking about letting any teacher that wants to carry concealed. That deputy also did not 'carry on a running gun battle'. He got a few shots off and ran.

Two teachers out of less than 30 is a decent percentage. Most people who carry concealed weapons do so for a reason: they don't want people to know they are carrying, so why in the hell would they tell anyone? We used to have ROTC in school along with hunter safety. These have all been forced off
campus as the NEA got a stranglehold on our schools.>

Actually, as Freud discovered, fear of guns was an indication of stunted sexual development and emotional immaturity. He called it hoplophobia.

Yeah, it just conditions people into being good little slaves to the government. Physical threats are much lesser in day to day adult life because adults carry concealed weapons on a day to day basis, thus the deterrent effect reduces the threat. I am still amazed that anti-gunners still fail at this
simple cause and effect logic. Irrational.

This is, and has been, illegal for a long time.  It is a felony to transfer
a gun to anyone who cannot legally obtain one themselves.

My standard has been posted here; since you conveniently missed 
it, I'll do so again (and 1000 more times, if necessary).  Nix to the 
mentally disturbes, children, felons, abusive spouses.  If you think 
that the foergoing are not more irresponsible than the general 
populace, then you are simply ignorant or simply simple. All may 
be created equal, but people's subsequent actions differentiate 
between them.  You keep on trotting out that old tired slippery 
slope domino theory; "If we let them do the rational and reasonable 
thing today, who knows where it may lead?"   What part of "general 
welfare" do you not understand?

There are exceptions to every rule, but they do not disprove the 
rule, merely probe its scope by means of their status as 
exceptions.  If the spouse is acquitted in court, they don't lose their 
right to keep and bear.  The penalty for suicide should be death ;~)
Let's castrate the rapists (chemically or otherwise) before we 
consider killing them (but what does that have to do with crazed 
armed teens running amuck in school halls?).

Concealed weapons do not function as specific deterrents; the 
chance that your average person will be carrying is still low enough 
for your average criminal to risk it.  Plus, I think that any teacher in 
school with a gun in his or her pocket is more dangerous than 
decent.  Keep them All out of schools, except for those the guards 
have, with metal detectors.

When I earlier said that one of your responses showed either a
lack of reading comprehension or dishonesty, I guessed the latter.
I now see that it is both.  In what possible stretch of the
English language can you interpret these words as anything of
the sort?  Where have I ever said or even implied that I do not
feel special reverence for sentient beings, or that I do not
suffer from their loss?  If you read my actual words as I wrote
them and not the imaginary meaning your mind is putting into them,
you'd see that I not only treasure humans but human feelings as
well; I just refuse to base decisions on those feelings instead
of reason.  If you believe feelings are not just a wonderful part
of being human, but also a useful guide to decision-making in
their own right, well, I have no respect for that belief, and
we'll have to leave it at that.

Logic is the process by which, given premises, they are processed 
to arrive at a conclusion.  One's shared existence with others in a 
common world provides the grounding for the premises.  You can't 
be just Spock; there has to be a little Kirk in there, too.

No, in fact it might be a good thing to see if something like a
(semi-)automatic perfusion/cooling machine couldn't be made 
already (within reasonable price limits). It would certainly
help a lot if the initial phases of a cryotransport were simplified
so that all you had to to is place the deceased in a capsule, 
and push a couple of buttons. The washout might require
some extra human assistence (plugging in the tubes etc.),
but external cooling (and perhaps internal as well, using the
cryovent cooling/oxigenating system) could be easily automated.
Saves everybody a lot of trouble, and looks really neat (the
capsule, I mean).

I wonder what kind of safety precautions have been taken to
protect the crew in case of an accident (or is this highly classified)?
Liquid/gel buffers (or air bags) in combination with 'cocoon seats', 
fire-proof layers, a titanium shell around the crew compartment etc. 
could presumably make the vehicle very safe indeed (at moderately 
higher cost).The design of regular rockets and the space shuttle would 
permit even better safety measures, like a crew compartment that 
automatically "ejects" in case of a mishap (a la Challenger), and 
gently floats back to earth. For some strange reason, this part of the
design has always been neglected. Similar techniques could be
used for VIP transport in planes btw.

Cooling is not a problem (could be as simple as intubation), 
perfusion is. Without advanced surgical robotics (which a) isn't there 
b) is going to be expensive for a long while once it arrives) there is 
no way how you could do it. 

This is not going to be an issue for a long, long time.

"Plugging in the tubes etc." is the understatement of the decade.

External cooling is not exactly efficient. You need liquid ventilation 
and/or peritoneal lavage to go down real quick. Combined with the
proper IV drug cocktail, you can postpone the washout for quite a long 
time.

"and looks really neat". I just love that sentence!

search so it will be possible to search for our team. They do
seem to have their hands full just keeping the thing running

A couple of points I'd like to raise here:

1) What possible extropian/ transhumanist merit can this pointless slanging
match have? It seems to be being conducted between sides who are *Never*
going to find a common ground and who are getting more abusive as the thread
continues.


2) Have you pro gun activists got any idea how completley mad you sound to
non Americans?

I'm probably going to provoke more rancid vitriol and get shot down in
flames for saying this, but just because something is written in your
precious constitution or your bill of rights does not mean that it is the be
all and end all, that it is simply the only thought worth entertaining and
no alternatives shall be brooked. If this were the case, can you explain to
me exactly why there are so many, or indeed *any* ammendments to your
constitution? I can think of one answer to this: Because it is imperfect. It
was a hashed up solution to the problems of the time and no clear thought
was given to its long term consequences. As such, situations have arisen
which the constitution was never designed to contend with and it has had to
be modified. It is in no way set in stone. Times change, and laws must
change with them. To advocate extropian beliefs on the one hand, and
dogmatic adherence to a quite clearly imperfect constitution on the other
hand seems somewhat at odds to me. But excuse me if I am stepping on your
constitutionally protected toes here, I mean no harm, I'm just curious as to
how you can rationalize this.


As for the merit of this discussion on the list, is it something along the
lines of:

*I'm looking to the future, but I'll shoot you if you get in my way.

Or maybe:

*Well, shucks ma, the end times are a-comin', let's arm ourselves to the
teeth and head for the hills.

Not very extropian admittedly, but as far as I can see, neither is this
thread.

Craig Dibble.

A concerned non-American (non gun owner).

I'd like to see someone come up with the instructions about what
constitutes "grave danger" here. It reminds me of Zaphod Beeblebrox's
sunglasses in Hitch Hiker's Guide (although it is a bit more positive).

Is this not already the case? Identity is an illusion, parallel brains
and all that...

I wonder... if we dig deep enough, will we find that neurons are far
more complex than we thought they were, and are actually the vessels for
uploaded intelligences from some previous advanced civilisation that
eventually hit its singularity?

Maybe you could build a brain where, rather than working together, the
neurons trade out of enlightened self interest.

With your statements above and Eugene response to them (no
quoted), think about it in Lem's context.  The point behind such
a device was for those who might be far away from help.  In
_Fiasco_, the person who uses the cryo unit is doing it because
he's lost and about to die.

They actually don't find him for a long time.  Even at the time of
his cryosuspension, they don't have the tech to revive him.  It's
just a gamble, but it pays off.

Now imagine you're far away from a suspension team and have
a choice between dying or being put into a clunky cryo chamber.
You might not worry as much about a lot of the damage a good
perfusion can prevent because your options are limited.

Also, one could think of such a cryo unit as something which a
suspension team could talk other people through using -- people
who are on site, but don't have medical or suspension skills.
That might be a different model than the self-cryosuspension
one.

In regard to this, I'd like to see someone attempt just something
simple first.  Afterward, he/she/they could improve upon it, solving
the perfusion and other problems -- rather than waiting for a perfect
robot/remote suspension unit.  Chances are the latter will develop
too late for many people..

Cheers!

So, what you're saying is that stuff happens, and as a result of this, other
stuff happens. Well blow me, thanks for pointing that out. There I was
wondering just how to get from A to B to X to Z but with no concept of
evolution or logical progression or cause and effect. Silly me.

Pardon? So you can show me some raw information can you? I'd love to see
what it looks like.

What assumption? And am I right in interpreting this as: "She accomplishes
this by not adding any fresh insight or work of her own"? Pointing at things
and saying "Look at that" does not constitute a particularly sound basis for
rational argument.

Quick break from the sarcasm: A fantastic book I remember reading as a

Human life maybe. Speak for yourself, not for those of us who aspire to be
more than human, seeing it as an imperfect stop-gap until we can come up
with something better.

Okay, so I've got no idea what the actual book is like, but if the review is
anything to go by, and given the apparent conclusions above, then my advice
is: Run away screaming. This is my first post to the list but I felt I had
to respond as this sort of wishy-washy, unenlightened /New Age
Enlightentment/ Deconstructionist/ Post-modernist (insert favourite
'love-to-hate' buzzword) nonsense, coupled with such terrible style, really
gets my goat. Campaign for plain English anyone? If Transhumanist /
Extropian goals are to be taken seriously and to be entertained in
respectable cirlces then we need to steer well clear of ties with the loony
enlightenment seekers who tend to make reasonable people cringe with fear
and find somewhere else to be as soon as they start talking. I'm perfectly
willing to listen to the other side of the debate, as long as it's given by
people who can communicate in such a way that you don't fall asleep or
forget what they're saying as soon as they open their mouths.

Trouble is that the analogy breaks down as the ants are not selfless
collectivists: they do not have a representation of the collective. They are
merely robots programmed to bring food home, kill things in the nest that
are not ants, etc.

If they each had a mental representation of the hive, then the analogy would
be valid, otherwise, it is like saying my telephone is a collectivist
because it connects me just whenever us humans want it too: it has no
choice, because it has no representation of that amongst which it might
choose.

I guess I'll weigh in also.

All of the insinuations and outright name-calling seem non-productive, to say
the least.  I think we can safely assume that we all share a desire to see the
overall level of violence decrease, whether in the schools or in society at
large.

I propose a test to determine whether rational debate is possible for this topic
on this list, in the form of two questions.  (1) If there existed a
preponderance of evidence showing that violence does in fact _decrease_ when
guns are readily available, would the anti-gun forces actually change their
stripes?  (2) If there existed a preponderance of evidence showing that violence
does in fact _increase_ when guns are readily available, would the pro-gun
forces renounce their faith in the proliferation of the weapons?  If the answer
to either question is "no" (as I rather suspect it is) then rational debate is
impossible and no one will allow themselves to become susceptible to whatever
evidence or argument the "other side" may offer.  A counter-productive
enterprise to say the least (though perhaps illuminating to any who do not feel
knowlegdeable enough to take a position).

I will contribute that I have seen studies of these questions conducted by
Professor Lott of Chicago, and am unaware of any party discovering major flaws
in his and his associates' work.  The studies strongly suggest that overall
levels of violence, death, and injury decrease when concealed-carry is legal.
They also show specifically that mass-shooting incidents such as at Columbine
also decrease markedly.  Finally, when analyzing the lawsuits pending against
gun manufacturers, they conclude that gun ownership saves society far more money
and people (in terms of crimes, injuries, and deaths prevented) than they cost
in terms of illegal shootings and suicides.  If anyone has missed the previous
references to this work on this list, I'm sure I can dig them up.

I am curious to know if anyone can present evidence (not flaming rhetoric) that
suggests the opposite conclusion.

It is probably just a temporary spike. Many will drop out as soon as
the novelty will have worn off. Two years is a long time for the Net

A Beowulf cluster with a much better price/performace ratio, stability 
and scalability could be installed within a few days, at a much lower
absolute cost. Perhaps excusable, if they got the hardware donated.

I think we may actually have 10 members on the team now, but
how about some more of you guys joining, eh? URL in my sig...
Anyway, here is an update from them about some of the problems
they are having:

"To our users: SETI@home is off to a great start! We now have
almost 350,000 users, many more than we expected. This has caused
some temporary problems: 

     Our servers are overloaded. You have probably seen "can't
     connect to server" messages; the problem is at our end, not
     yours. 

     Credit for work units and CPU time may not show up immediately
     in your totals.
 
     Our new "team" feature has had some problems; If you've joined
     a team, you may need to get a new password and join it again.
 
     We are a bit overwhelmed with emails and bug reports, and won't
     be able to respond to them individually. Please check our "known      bugs"
list carefully before reporting problems. 

We're working hard to fix these problems. With the help of new high-performance
machines from Sun Microsystems, we'll upgrade our server capacity; this will
happen in about a month. We'll release
new versions of the client software (probably next week) that will
deal with server problems in a more user-friendly way. 

So please bear with us during these "growing pains", and thanks for being part
of this incredible project."

Only a tiny percentage of the population is composed of violent criminals.
Probability dictates that even if only a small percentage of the population
carries, it creates a significant selection pressure on the criminal
population (do the math; while the percentages are small, there is a huge
increase in actual risk to the criminal).  This isn't just theoretical;
there is *a lot* of real world evidence strongly suggesting the validity of
the math.

An article I came across that shows some prisons using incentives to
control the inmates behavior;  I believe this coes from the Oregonian :



You can take away their TV, end their exercise time or throw them into
solitary, but the best way Benton County Jail officials have found to
control unruly inmates is "nutra-loaf." 
               Fear of subsisting on nothing but
the pasty-tasting concoction of bread, imitation cheese, beans and
carrots three times a day has miscreants shaping up, jailers say. 
               Nutraloaf was spawned in Clark
County and is becoming popular with other jails. Although it is highly
nutritious, inmates have filed lawsuits in Washington, Oregon, and
federal courts against the food, saying eating it three times a day
constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. All the lawsuits failed. 
               While other inmates are dining on
macaroni and cheese, salad with ranch dressing and chocolate chip
cookies, those being punished get one nutraloaf at each meal. 
               Each dense one-pound loaf contains
about 1,000 calories. Ingredients include whole wheat bread, imitation
cheese, grated carrots, canned spinach, raisins, beans, vegetable oil,
tomato paste, instant milk, and dehydrated potato flakes. It is served
cold. 
               "I don't recall anybody asking for
seconds," said Ardie Jones, the jail food service manager. 
How to make nutraloaf: 
6 slices whole wheat bread.
1.5 cups imitation cheese
.75 cup drained spinach
.75 cup grated carrots.
.5 cup raisins
3 cups cooked great northern beans
4 tbs. vegetable oil
1 cup tomato paste
.75 cup instant nonfat dry milk.
.5 cup dehydrated potato flakes 
               Mix ingredients into a bowl. Pour
into three loaf pans. Bake at 325 degrees for 40 minutes. Makes 3
one-pound loaves.

Scientists: Cloned sheep Dolly has 'old' DNA 
 May 26, 1999
Web posted at: 6:10 p.m. EDT (2210 GMT)
LONDON (Reuters) -- Scientists who created Dolly the sheep, the world's
first mammal cloned from an adult cell, said Wednesday she has slight
DNA damage that could have an impact on how cloning technology is used
in the future. 
Dolly and two other cloned sheep have shorter telomeres -- the tiny
strands of DNA at the end of chromosomes that scientists believe may
hold the secrets to youth and aging. 
Telomeres shorten each time a cell divides and are progressively eroded
as an animal ages. As the telomeres shorten the chromosomes can become
unstable and prone to damage. 
Researchers from Edinburgh's Roslin Institute and PPL Therapeutics said
Dolly, who was cloned from a cell taken from a 6-year-old sheep, had
telomeres that were about 20 percent shorter than those of other sheep
of a similar age. 
"We don't see any signs of any problem in Dolly and the other animals
but perhaps it is too early to note such a problem. We just don't know,"
PPL's Alan Colman said in an interview. 
The finding, reported in a letter to the science journal Nature, is not
unexpected. Scientists know that cell culture leads to a shortening of
telomeres and cells used for Dolly and the other sheep were cultured in
the laboratory. 
In Dolly's case the shortening was compounded because she was derived
from a cell from a middle-aged animal. 
"This telomere erosion is just one form of DNA damage. People have
speculated for years that as we get older our cells accumulate mutations
individually. When you make an animal from one of those cells it is
possible that you are transferring that," Colman said. 
Although the research does not appear to have any consequences for
cloning livestock it could have implications in other uses of the
technology. 
"It reminds people this is an issue that should be called into account
in any of the proposals for, not so much agricultural cloning, but some
of the uses in human therapeutic cloning where extensive time periods of
culture in vitro would be necessary. It could be an issue," he added. 
Therapeutic cloning to improve treatments for serious diseases such as
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's or to create cloned tissue and organs would
involve the use of adult cells. "Human therapeutic cloning, if it ever
does come about, is going to use human adult cells. That's the whole
purpose," said Colman. 
The research could be particularly important in sequential cloning --
cloning a clone of a clone -- which could lead to progressive shortening
of telomeres. 
But Coleman and his colleagues said problems, if they do arise, may not
be insurmountable. Scientists can use embryonic cells for cloning and
could also cut the cell time in culture which could reduce telomere
shortening.

I was reading this over at Edge:

http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/prize/prize_index.html

regarding the usefulness of giving away prizes for certain
science and/or tech advances. It seems to me that in general
this is a good idea, although as discussed on the site there
are certain limitations. I'd be curious if this has come up
on the list before, and what the consensus (if any) was.

So what if there was a site, say scitechprizes.org, where
anyone could go and make donations using their credit card
to a prize of their choice? Would this be worth setting up
to get us moving even faster to the maybe-Singularity?

Lemme know what you think, because I have to decide eventually
whether or not to pay for the domain :-)

128 bits isn't enough.  Really.  1Thz isn't enough for molecular
assemblers, and while 573.9Gy seems like a long time now, it's only 40
ages of the Universe.  I propose the following PostTimeXML identifier:

<posthuman-time>
 <universe>Socrates</universe>
       <!-- Universe identifier. -->
 <seconds>08402834082304.83245353453452546456432</seconds>
       <!-- Seconds since start of Universe. -->
 <branch>1001001011</branch>
       <!-- Quantum computing qubit branch indicator for 10 qubits -->
</posthuman-time>

If you really need a digital identifier, then use the native format for
your machine.
The standard used by most Jupiter-Beowolf networks is IEEE 3.2983e48,
the following 256-bit format in big-endian order:

  8 bits -- Current universe (index into local table; 0 = machine-local;
1 = Earth).
 24 bits -- Current quantum branch.
 32 bits -- WEYL tensor (relativistic data).
 96 bits -- Seconds since start of current Universe.
 96 bits -- Fractional seconds (0x00..01 = 12.6218 grouchoseconds).

However, most Omega Point devices simply use the XML format, both
because Omega time is infinitely divisible, and because they have the
processing power to spare.

James, its to bad that you have such a hard time with dunking mail that you
don't want.  I consider your message the same as spam, it was useless and a
nuisance, I had to dunk it.  It just happens that some times I find interest
in some of the spam which I wouldn't otherwise get if it didn't come in on
this list.  Become a big boy and just deal with it.  Why should other people
have to go through special gyrations because you are lazy.  Its not so bad
to be spammed, as long as it doesn't happen so often, why are you so overly
concerned to create a ruckus...

Good idea. Perhaps you could even use a camera (via the web) for

Yes, it's good to start with a relatively simple model (mainly external
cooling, which is presumably the most important), and expand from 
there (add cryovent, ways to inject medication and finally perfusion
equipment). That would certainly be a useful thing to do for local groups.

Good point. Of course, the idea that ants live in some kind of
socialist utopia is a popular myth, in reality ant societies are very
nice examples of spontaneous orders: put together many elements with
carefully selected simple behaviors and you get a very adaptive,
resilient system. There is no central planning in an anthill, just
huge numbers of individuals with programming based on collective
reproductive success.

That was the rhetoric, although the original goals were borganisation
on the global scale too (it ended for purely practical reasons; it was
more economical for the "borganism" and especially its leaders just to
have an empire than spend huge resources and take big risks on
internationalization). In the end, the SU ended up like any other
individual nation.

On the other hand, the available bandwidth is increasing
exponentially. Oh well, another Singularity-type curve. Of course, it
is the bandwidth senses-brain (somewhere in the 10-100 Mbit/s range)
that is the real problem, full borganisation likely requires much
more.

No, more unrelated species share less DNA.  Exact percentages can
likely be found on the web.  However, as far as I know most currently
existing life (with the exception of viruses and very stripped down
bacteria) share the same basic "metabolism libraries". After all, life
had existed for a long while before the archaea, procaryotes and
eucaryotes split.

May 27 *Nature* reports Dolly and two sheepish cloned pals have shorter
telomeres than controls.

http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/990526/ca_geron_1.html

So they're a kind of testbed for the telomere theory of aging, as some of
us speculated.

a very great idea ;))... if federal belgium is dissolved, perhaps I would be
able to contribute money to really interesting (at least according to me)
projects by such a mean... in fact I can't see another way now to do just
that. Make scientists and technologists propose their stuff and people to
pay for projects of their informed choice. not the choice of a set of
elected?? lamers without a femtopound of insight like here.

Or - d'oh! - telomerase could be used to normalize the chromosomes before
ignition and liftoff.  Or an hTERT package (human telomerase reverse
transcriptase, the catalytic component of telomerase) could be inveigled in
to *ensure* that telomerase stays active and kicking in all cells in the
new beastie, which might therefore become immortal at a blow - until it
dies of cancer, of course. But we need to fix cancers anyway...

Funny how these just-next-step extrapolations are always missing from news
reports (and possibly from the mouths of cautious scientists).

So where exactly does the Second Amendment say 'the right to keep and bear
arms shall not be infringed except for mentally disturbed, children, felons
and abusives spouses'? I don't see it there, I can only assume you have a
different version of the Constitution to me. The states can probably pass
such laws, but any Federal disarmament laws are utterly unconstitutional.

Victim disarmament is neither rational nor reasonable, and almost every 
country which has imposed registration of guns (and background checks are
registration by default) has gone on to ban and confiscate many or most 
of those registered guns. Most gun owners are reasonable people, and have
been willing to accept 'reasonable' infringements on their rights... and
you know what? The disarmers continually come back with just one more
'reasonable' infringement to add to the list until all rights are gone;
their desire to completely ban private ownership of guns is hardly a
secret. This will only stop when gun owners stand up and stop being
'reasonable'.

>What part of "general

Ok Joe, since you're the Constitutional expert, you explain just what
'general welfare' means in the context it's used in the Constitution.

Joe, if my gun is a penis and you're scared of it, what does that say about
you, hmm? You really don't have a clue, do you? Only an idiot who's never

Typical irrational knee-jerk anti-gun nut. People like you are the reason

Ask Joe; he's the one who's throwing the insults around, most of our replies
have been considered, reasonable and rational.

But more to the point, a society which can't handle people owning a few wimpy
little guns is not a society which will let people have really dangerous
technology like nanotech. The things we talk about routinely on this list
will be demonized and restricted just as much as guns if we let the control
freaks have their way.

Odd. I know plenty of non-Americans who are also pro-gun activists, or at
least sympathisers; most of them are irate gun-owners disarmed by good old
Tony Blair. Modern anti-gun Brits, of course, would have sounded completely
mad a century ago when anyone could carry a gun -- and many did -- and the government's ideal was a rifle in every home to protect against invasion;
a policy whose end would have proved fatal if Hitler had a clue about war.

So the government employees who swore to uphold the Constitution are free
to ignore it at will when they see fit?

Indeed. So all the anti-gun fanatics have to do is repeal the Second
Amendment; the mechanism is quite clearly elaborated in the Constitution,
they just have to do it. They refuse, and prefer just to ignore it...

I'm curious as to how anyone can rationalise ignoring the very law that the
US government was created under whenever they see fit? You'd be happy if
T.B. just declared himself dictator and refused to hold any more elections
because the British 'constitution' is outdated?

Yeah, Joe is pretty fanatical about disarming us at gunpoint, isn't he? Why
is it that the disarmers are so desperate to kill anyone who disagrees with
them?

Joe, you should really take a look at gun sale statistics sometime. You know
what? You can tell when any new disarmament laws were passed, because they're
followed by a big peak in sales as people rush out to buy more guns before 
they're banned. Anti-gun laws drive new gun sales in the US.

As an American gun owner, I'd like to add my voice to this comment.  The 
recurring gun debate is usually prolonged by entrenched folks willing to 
engage in flame wars because the deep ideological divides and strong 
psychological factors involved aren't conducive to peaceful dialogue.  I'd 
like to request that posters in these threads limit their writing to a civil 
statement of their own positions and a willingness to let the matter go for 
now -- we've had too much experience with this topic here to believe that any 
resolution is likely for now.  BTW, I would love to take Anders up on his 
challenge to develop liberating technological responses to the issues (which 
IS very extropian), but unfortunately have a couple of large projects 
percolating at work now.  I'll end by reiterating a request for civility and 
that posters PLEASE refrain from unnecessary profanity.

I strongly disagree; if Joe was interested in reducing the level of violence,
then he would listen to what we have to say, rather than insulting us and
calling for banning gun ownership when it's been well-proven not to reduce
violence. If it did, assaults wouldn't be twice as common in Britain as in
America, for example.

There's also a question as to how you measure 'violence'. European countries,
for example, love to claim that they're less violent than America, yet tens
of millions of Europeans have been killed in wars this century. Which is
really more violent?

No. There is, and they don't care. I saw a wonderful TV show a few months
ago supposedly debating whether handguns should be banned in Britain. On
the one side were the reasonable, rational gun owners calmly pointing out 
the irrationality of the disarmers' position, then the presenter himself
stated quite categorically that they didn't care, they wanted to ban guns,
and ban them they were going to do. Wish I'd taped it, as it was the best
example of disarmers' utter hysterical irrationality I've ever seen, at
least before Joe began posting here.

Failure to resolve this on the side of freedom will result in the publicly

side.

Yes, I am sure that slaves are quite bewildered when confronted with

For any discussion to move forward, it first must begin somewhere. In order for
all to move forward together, you must all know and agree exactly where all are
starting from. That some people cannot or will not read plain English due to
their own agenda or meme infections is the sole reason why this discussion
cannot progress. That Mr. Dees continues to spout his rude and insulting rants
that are in contradiction to the libertarian/extropian spirit of Unlimited
Individual Freedom

The times ahead promise to be very, very dynamic, and full of risk. The power
that computers provide can be used to either greatly free us or greatly enslave
us. Those with extropian values who refuse to be political or support those that
are political are IMHO being extremely stupid, and might as well physically bury
their heads in the sand. Those that do not take active measures to empower
themselves to resist attempts at their enslavement will wind up enslaved.
"People get the government they deserve". You might as well start practicing the
mantra,"resistance is futile" now....

Actually those of us who are pro-choice have argued quite
rationally, and avoided name calling. The extropian merit is that
we argue that certain rights are individual, not subject to
government regulation, but personal responsibility.

>2) Have you pro gun activists got any idea how completley mad you

To be quite honest, I couldn't care less. We are no ones subjects,
and never will be again, unlike my northern Irish cousins. 

I believe the right to defend oneself is an individual right, not
subject to compromise. Anyone who believes differently is welcome
to try and argue this with the Kosovar Albanians.

You haven't provoked me at all. Of course the Constitution is not
written in stone and of course it is subject to change. The point
we are raising is that many of the 20,000 gun laws in this country
violate our rights as defined in this document that is the basis
for our government/society. This by definition is injustice and we
are fighting to rectify it.

The anti-gun folks could properly try and repeal the second
amendment, but they know the possibility of doing this is near 0.

This is not irrational emotional provokation at all, no not at all.

Well, I guess the researchers are of the cautious type who first want
to get control group data of the telomerase theory (like premature
aging of Dolly and family) and then move on to fix it. If it turns out
that the telomerase theory was wrong, they will instead look at what
is new before trying to change it. My guess is that Geron et al will
be there much more quickly, although in a less proper scientific way.

Check the archives; I think you will find that none of us (or
perhaps one) is using the Constitution as a /reason/ to support
freedom.  That would indeed be irrational.  Laws are just paper,
and the Constitution is no different.  I certainly respect that
document, and will use it to my advantage against the forces
of evil when I can, but I do not make decisions based on it.
My decisions are based on mt own judgment of right and wrong,
and what works and what doesn't.  Self-defense is a fundamental
human right--and duty.  Guns are an appropriate technology of
the day for accomplishing that.  When newer technologies come
along, I'll fight for the freedom to use those too, and I'm
sure that Goo Control International will fight against me.
Gun control laws are a miserable failure by any measure; one
doesn't need the Constitution to show that.

Is your idea to set up an informational site with links to current prizes that
accept donations, or to establish prize categories and accept donations for
these new prizes? If it is the later, you need to legally establish non-profit
status which involves time and expense.

If you are going to undertake the effort and expense, you should determine what
is the most effective method for achieving your desired results. One who finds a
science and/or tech advance has a good chance of getting funding to further
pursue said efforts from venture capitalists or businesses interested in the
technology. Therefore, the prize may be superfluous at that point. It may be
more beneficial to accept donations for funding promising research efforts that
would not be done because of a lack of funds. Just some things to consider.

Cheers,
Jon

This is too simplistic. Readily available to who? Even if guns are outlawed here
today, the criminals will still have ready access to guns to their hearts desire,
there are so many squirreled away. Given this, and since it has already been
conclusively proven that crime does in fact go down when guns are readily available
and can be carried concealed by law abiding citizens, then I can say, ok. A telling
fact is that Prof. John Lott's original study was done under the employ of Handgun
Control Inc, until his results showed the opposite of what HCI wanted him to prove.
HCI took him to court to prevent him from attaching their name in any way to the
study, and despite the fact that his study covers the largest sample of crime data
in history (all FBI crime stats from 1979 to 1995), the gun crime researchers who
are invested in the gun control cause insist on calling his study 'flawed'.

I like Eugene's ambition of a >HTS, but I think we need to integrate a
space standard too. After all, we will be dealing with relativistic
stuff and simultanity will becomre tricky (one could set up some kind
of "mean universal hyperbolic time" based on the "flattest" spacelike
slices we can foliate the universe with, but the precision will be
troublesome).

Maybe one could do something exactly corresponding to the time format
to measure space, but the coordinate system will be tough. The
topology censorship conjecture might make spacetime a bit more boring
that we have hoped, but it is still bendy and tricky. Some way of
translating local maps into an atlas? This sounds like an area where
differential geometry and computational geometry could come in handy.

I like Eugene's ambition of a >HTS, but I think we need to integrate a
space standard too. After all, we will be dealing with relativistic
stuff and simultanity will becomre tricky (one could set up some kind
of "mean universal hyperbolic time" based on the "flattest" spacelike
slices we can foliate the universe with, but the precision will be
troublesome).

Maybe one could do something exactly corresponding to the time format
to measure space, but the coordinate system will be tough. The
topology censorship conjecture might make spacetime a bit more boring
that we have hoped, but it is still bendy and tricky. Some way of
translating local maps into an atlas? This sounds like an area where
differential geometry and computational geometry could come in handy.

The USA is one of the top gun-owning countries, but there are others
which have as high or higher rates of gun ownership.  Switzerland and
Afghanistan, for instance, though those two countries could hardly be
more different from each other.  In Switzerland, target shooting is a
popular sport, with a patriotic flavor.  Most adult males (up to 50 years
of age) are members of the militia and normally keep a military rifle at
home.  Switzerland claims that it can mobilize a 600,000 man force in 48
hours.


Traditionally, rural Afghanistan is heavily armed and rather lawless,
something like the Wild West, though the Afghans possess a high sense of
honor and hospitality.  In the 1700s the Afghans would steal or capture
muzzle-loading guns  from the British, and make copies, right down to the
insignia.  There is a story, perhaps apocryphal, that some Afghans once
stealthily looted a British armory, replacing the guns with copies, and
the British were unaware of the switch.


In Russia, surprisingly, gun ownership is widespread today in rural
areas, though I don't know if that was so during the most repressive
years of communism.

Agreed that the US Constitution is imperfect, but if one were to try to
write a 'perfect' constitution, it's perfection would be judged on how
well it achieves its objectives.  And different objectives would result
in different constitutions.  The Bill of Rights is the first 10
amendments, and those were negotiated as a package between the time that
the constitution was first written  (1787) and its adoption, the
understanding being that the Bill of Rights would be addled soon after
the constitution went into effect (1789).  There were actually 12
amendments in the (1789) proposed Bill of Rights, two did not make it
when the 10 amendments were adopted in 1791, although one of the two was
ratified 202 years later in 1992, and it is now the 27th amendment.

This is true, up to a point, but the Constitution has proven to be quite
durable.  During the 200 or so years that the US Constitution has been in
effect, the USA has arguably been more successful, by many measures, than
most other countries.  With the exception of the Civil War, the US track
record of stability has rivalled that of the most stable countries during
that time period.

It is not necessarily the case that supporters of gun rights base their
support mainly on a dogmatic adherence to the Constitution.  My
impression is that pro-gun rights people believe in gun rights as a
philosophical matter, and would believe just as strongly if gun ownership
were not even mentioned in the Constitution.  The fact that the Second
Amendment exists is welcomed by pro-gun rights people, as it may provide
a legal basis for arguing against gun control laws, but the Second
Amendment is not the reason they believe as they do.



An interesting thing about the Constitution is how major provisions of
the Constitution are seemingly ignored.  The Second Amendment is an
excellent example of this.  The amendment states, in part, that 'the
right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'  But
most large cities, and many states, have draconian gun control laws which
would seem to be unconstitutional on their face.  And the multi-million
member NRA, a powerful pro-gun lobbying group, seems completely unable to
get any gun control laws invalidated by the courts on constitutional
grounds.

Again, no, of course not, but a system must be able to change as needs
arise, and the process of change must be open to reasoned debate. Clinging
to an outdated system and/or refusing to allow for the possibility of change
can only end up doing harm. If we can't or won't allow the systems under
which we must live to evolve, how can we hope to step up the evolutionary
ladder ourselves?

This may be a weak argument, but to me there seems to be little
extropian value in enslaving oneself to a gun.  Making a gun one's first
defense to any threat, imagined or otherwise,  is hardly developing
yourself as a human.  Non-violence, while less spectacular and seemingly
slower to get results, is (in my opinion) always to be preferred to a
violent approach.

This may soon come to an end. A Federal Judge, Sam R. Cummings
recently ruled (U.S. vs Emerson) that the second amendment applies
to individuals not the state, and wrote an excellent decision
overturning a case.

The Reno/Justice Dept is planning on an appeal to the Supreme
Court, we'll see if they chicken out yet again.....

I much prefer non-violence. I would bet that everyone on this list prefers 
it, also. I would also bet that the maroity of humans prefer it. 

But the fact at issue here is not non-violence vs. violence (or violence as " 
one's first defense to any threat, imagined or otherwise" ), but whether or 
not individuals ought to be allowed to own guns.

The problem with banning guns is, ultimately, that one's life is one's 
responsibility to support and defend. Just as one ought to be free to make a 
living ( a basically libertarian premise) one also ought to be free to 
*protect* that life. And so long as there exists a threat of a forceful 
attack on oneself, it is quite prudent to have the means to protect your 
life. 

A completely centralized protection agency (like police) is inefficient in 
the same way for the same reasons as a completely centralized economic 
planner. The problem of information ( Who needs protection? How do I choose 
amongst competing claims? ) ultimately makes centralization fail (among other 
reasons).

Finally, besides personal responsibility and central inefficiency, I think 
that thinking that one can legislate virtue in a populace is incorrect. A 
society emerges from a group of people, and a virtuous society emerges from a 
group of virtuous citizens. Its a "bottom-up" phenomenon, not a "top-down" 
one.

Well, I hope I've added something constructive here.

William

PS- What are some good "top-down" phenomena? That is, what are some systems 
that work well in a "top-down" way?

It cannot be argusd that removing guns selectively from those with 
the propensity to lawlessly and/or irresponsibly use them 
(convicted violent criminals, children, the mentally deficient or 
deranged, spouse and/or child abusers) would provide the 
maximum in societal protection.  However, the pro-gunners are 
addicted to punishment and immune to prevention.  They would 
rather have Harris and Klebold shoot up a school full of kids, and 
then punish them, than to adopt reasonable and rational measures 
designed to prevent the guns from getting into their hands.

A stupid comparison, but one that anti-abortionists and gun nuts 
love, just like the Nazi comparison.  They forget that during 
antebellum times, abortion was not even a mastered surgical 
procedure, guns were a lot less efficient killers than they are now, 
and were held by all slaveowners, and that slavery is and shall ever 
be henceforth forbidden by our constitution, and that gun ownership 
mushroomed under the Reich, while the penalty for abortion was 
changed by them from a paltry 40 marks to six years 
imprisonment.  The other side of the death camp coin was the 
Lebensborns, where women were forcibly bred to SS officers 
selected for their Aryan characteristics; the children were adopted 
out to "good" Nazi families and raised to fight, produce and 
reproduce for the State.

I beg to disagree, and a simple archive check will verify my 
objection.  BTW, how contradictory is it to try to foist personal 
responsibility on the irresponsible (violent criminals, children, the 
mentally deficient and/or deranged, spouse and/or child abusers)?  
I do not wish people like that to have the ability to decide whether I 
live or die with the squeeze of a trigger, and consider the effort to 
extract guns from their hands to be a matter of personal 
preservation.

You also believe that the right of the aforementioned irresponsible

I don't want to repeal the 2nd Amendment, I just want to restrict

Until they go into effect.  After that, things will more than balance

If this is true, then why does Switzerland not have a terrible history of
school murders and psychotic teenagers branding the weapons of their 'decent
normal FREE citizen' parents. The reason is because their society isn't
as screwed up like in the US.

One thing that I have to say that has REALLY got on my nerves is the
following:

After the latest shooting at Colombine in CO, CNN had a guy (member of NRA)
who looked professional enough, suited like a normal businessman and asked
how he would feel if Congress passed new gun laws to help prevent such
incidents from happening again. (Many of you may have seen the same clip.)

Well, the guy basically said that if the authorities attempted to take any
of his weapons away he would open fire and stand his ground. Lets have a
summary on the logic of that shall we ... this apprently average normal
person would rather shoot and kill police officers doing their job than have
his precious killing tool taken away. Totally unwilling to compromise about
any changes in the laws at all.

Before people start countering what I am saying, getting hostile and start
bitching about freedom, let me state my opinions so you know where I am
standing. I believe people have the right to protect themselves, with guns
if need be in special circumstances, but I don't believe that everyone
should have the right to own one or gain access to one so easily. This is
NOT about freedom, hell, you don't need to brand a gun to be free and I
really wish people would stop making that assumption. Just because every
other country in the world doesn't have teenagers killing each other every 2
weeks, it does not mean they are slaves!  One word - paranoia.

To support my point I state this:  The guy I was just referring to who
stated he would rather kill a police officer (who most likely has a wife and
family) or other law enforcement officers than have his gun taken away
SHOULD have his license revoked for saying that and have his weapons taken
away as he is talking like a potential killer and is clearly a threat to the
general public from my perspective.  In the US, most people who go around
saying "I have the constitutional right to carry guns" appear unstable and
trigger happy.  And THAT is the reality of it. Considering these rights were
created in a time where it was alright to blast people, its about time those
that believe everyone should have a gun should wake the hell up and realise
that that was then and this is now.

Most people who claim they have a gun for personal protection have very
little need for that claim. Unless you work for the government or some other
agency that MAY put your life at risk or threat then chances are you have no
need for a gun.  But what about home security?  Bullshit! Guns can be
expensive not to mention the ammo ... why not spend that money in investing
in better alarm systems and top quality locks for your home and windows?
Invest your money in a silent alarm connected with the local police
department. But ohh no, that would take away the fun of blasting the gun toy
at an intruder ...

If freedom comes at the cost of the lives of dozens of kids every month,
then screw it, I support the government and the security agencies that are
trying to restrict such a free flowing gun-ridden society. New gun laws does
not mean violation of rights (that were written when the earth was still
cooling) or is against freedom, its against unnecessary death and reduction
of terrorism.  True, criminals could still get hold of guns, but the last 10
incidents at schools usually involved guns from normal households, not
illegally through the black market.

Shooting for sports is different, however that issue is usually used by some
members of the NRA as an outlet for their dillusional anti-government
controling paranoia.

The bottom line is, not everyone is a schitzo with a gun, some of us
actually realise that you can live and be free without the obsessive need to
carry a gun. Of course new gun laws can be compromised, however, those who
are against any new laws are simply not willing to compromise. So the
situation will most probably stay grid locked.

Rick
(Waiting for the huge sulking unreasonable non agreeing outcry that will
most likely follow these opinions).

To change it when times dictate (see the anti-slavery and women's 
sufferage amendments for examples).  I'm not advocating the 
repeal of the 2nd amendment (a chunk of straw bullus shittus the 
gun nuts try to bean any advocate of reasonable restrictions with), 
but, as I said before, and am willing to say 1000 times more, if 
necessary, gun ownershp should be denied to violent criminals, the 
mentally deficient and/or deranged, children, and spouse and/or 
child abusers (I've filed that list so I can copy and paste it 
when/wherever appropriate).

Err, this was just an illustration. I actually propose having a 
counter with sufficient number of bits to allow for a wraparound 
of many times (at least 10^9) the current age of the universe with 
a resolution of about 10^-43 s. Once again, I think the counter 
should use an encoding with Hamming distance of 1..3 between 
each atomic increment and also allow only a narrow lightcone 
for bitflips (for instance:
t=0 00000000010000000
t=1 00000000100000000
) since with faster clock information propagation will be bottlenecked 
by relativistic constraints.

Such a thing can be currently implemented in software: e.g. similiar
to the Swatch time hack for the Palm Pilot or as a counter on a webpage.

If you have a GPS receiver to hack, such a thing would be actually
useful since allowing to time-stamp events (with DGPS a realtime
accuracy of few 10 cm, which is more than sufficient for most current 
purposes): using the >HTS and the GPS coordinates. GPS does already do 
relativistic corrections.

It's not too difficult to implement 256-bit counters, but currently
you need a silicon foundry for that. Let's wait for the advent of
molecular manufacturing.

Here's the fucking liar Mark, fucking lying again.  Where have I ever 
advocated such a thing (unless you're criminal, deranged, deficient, 
abusive or a child, all of which I increasingly see as likelihoods with 
you)?  I simply said that I would be willing to kill anyone who tried 
to kill me for holding my opinions (it's called the 1st amendment, 
nimrod), and so should anyone be willing to defend freedom of 
thought and expression in America.

I've followed this thread a little bit and have noticed what most of
the rest of us have noticed - that this is an issue that many of us
have very strong feelings about.

I share some of your concerns that guns are very good killers and that
gun control advocates too often insist on punishment after the fact
instead of prevention before the fact.

However, consider the following (and correct me if I'm wrong):

There are millions upon millions of guns in this country.  Many are
legally owned by peaceful citizens who have no intention of ever
harming anyone.  Many are also owned by criminals who gladly use them
to commit horrible crimes such as rape, murder, etc. etc.

Without some draconian governmental involvement which would curtail an
incredible amount of liberty (door to door searches, roadblocks, etc),
criminals will always have ready access to firearms in this country.

Knowing this, what is your extropian solution to this problem?  If
citizens are to be denied access to firearms, please explain how they
are to defend themselves from the criminals who still have weapons.  

How would gun control fit in with the Extropians principles of Open
Society and Self-Direction?  

If I have misread your intentions, I apologize, but it seems as though
you very much wish to restrict peaceful people's access to firearms.  

I'm very interested in your response.

"Promote the general welfare" basically means to maximize the

Agree very much. I just couldn't think of any really global
standard. Using pulsars as timing sources (with compensation for
slowdown) for a kind of a galactic time-of-flight GPS is the best 
I can come up with. Unfortunately, the slowdown constant isn't
accurate enough to measure short time spans, and most pulsars are
directed. One should record as many of them as possible, a nice
analogy to GPS satellite coverage.

True, but whoever goes skidding around a singularity will know to
readjust his clock when he comes back by synching it with those left 
behind. Unfortunately, there are no simple sensors directly measuring 
spacetime curvature...

And both removing guns from the hands of the irresponsible (violent

and/or child abusers) and preventing them from arriving there is a 
reasonable, rational and prudent life-protection measure to take.

Not to indulge in ad populum too much, but the restrictions I have

First they argue that they only want to take guns from criminals and
dangerous psychotics, now you recommend removing rights for thought
crimes and /potential/ criminals?  Do you honestly believe that your
broad knowledge of psychology and extensive interview with this man
qualifies you to make the judgment that he is unfit to exercise the
same rights you and I have?  In my judgment, he merely said that he
was willing to use those rights for precisely their intended purpose,
i.e., to defend himself from those (such as the police) who invade
his home with the intent to forcefully deprive him of his rights and
the means to exercise them.  I'd have no problem at all with having
this man as a neighbor or business associate; he speaks his mind and
is willing to stand up for what's right.  And I have nothing to fear
from him because I have no desire to interfere with his choices.  I
wouldn't buy a used bike for $10 from Sarah Brady or her followers--
they've shown that they clearly lack the personal integrity to be
trusted with anything, least of all my life and liberty.

Peace is not a goal that can be worked toward; justice is the goal,
and peace is the natural consequence of justice.

I think you have that a bit backwards, violence, in any form is the
_last_ resort to be taken in resolving a conflict.
I see no question of being 'enslaved' to a gun, a gun is merely another
tool, are you enslaved to your hair brush?
The point of gun ownership, aside from the pleasure of target (for
myself) or game shooting is a: To have that final option should a
situation arise that can't be
                    dealt with in any other way.
                 b: In the US at least, as the last defense against the
tyranny of
                     government.

Despite what has been said previously on this thread the framers of the
Constitution were very forward thinking men attempting to create a
document that would stand the test of time. The fact that they were
unable to envision our current society in no way invalidates their
efforts, in fact the results of their labor have stood up very well.

The security issue in this situation lies in repitition, a layering of
programming instructions, one atop the other thus covering any holes. There
would also have to be an on board repair command. This would recreate a
failed structure before activation began. Consider also, replaceable parts.
Your focus is a well stated fact, programming and software will be important
implimentations of a utility fog or nanoassembler.

My point was made from an individualistic standpoint. An individual takes 
action for an individual's life. Laws are not individual action, they are 
systematic violence (as I thinkwas pointed out previously). I do agree that 
it is bad when the category of people you write get guns....but I definitely 
disagree with your methods (law).

Voting is not an example of an emergent phenomenon. Voting is the tyranny 
that you mention. what I was trying to say was that virtue is what people 
choose to do. One can only have a virtuous society when the people choose to 
be virtuous.
 
The danger of "one's future being erased by a crazed minority of one" is 
something I am *deeply* concerned about. In fact, I try to be concerned about 
my future being erased by *anything*. I think the best way to protect my life 
is to *protect* my life. I think that finding good ivestments to avoid my 
savings from being eaten away by inflation protects my life. I think exercise 
and good nutrition protects my life. And I think owning a gun protects my 
life. 

I am sypathetic to your concerns about danger from guns; they are very 
dangerous things. I happen to think guns are very scary (though I expect this 
will lessen considerably once I learn how to use them). But ( to be cliched) 
I find being unarmed in the face of armed assailants *much* more scary. And I 
wish to avoid that situation.

I think in the advanced states we may differ, we may also be more acceptable
and able to withstand a seperate environment, in this new freedom of choice
atmosphere. A type A or a type B could select to be so and live in each ones
particular way and place.

Do you feel that the prohibition against owning a thermonuclear 
weapon, or Anthrax bacillus, or Sarin, or C-4, or Botulinin toxin, or 
even a submachine gun, renders you a slave?  Then you have a 
pretty stultified and monochromatic view of what freedom's all about.

As I have stated before, the most peaceful and safest society is 
one in which there is no restriction upon the law-abiding and 
responsible citizenry owning guns, yet strives to keep them out of 
the hands of those who would have a disproportionate propensity to 
misuse them (violent criminals, the mentally deficient and/or 
deranged, children, and spouse and or child abusers).  To do this 
requires all gun sales to proceed through background checks to 
identify such individuals and prevent them from completing their 
attempted gun purchases, and the child-proofing of all weapons by 
means of key or combination trigger locks (or under reasonably 
secure lock and key, not just in a glass cabinet) which are held in 
homes in which children reside.  With the passage of time, natural 
attrition (keeping the guns out of the hands of the new irresponsible 
as the old irresponsible die of old age, commit crimes and are 
incarcerated, or divest) would facilitate the evolution of a safer 
nation.

He announced his willingness, even his eagerness, to shoot people 
in order to protect his right to possess the very gun with which he 
would be shooting these people.  I tend to believe people like that; I 
also tend to believe that they are paranoid, defensive, and overly 
agressive.  All he has to do is mistake someone's intentions 
ONCE, and he'll shoot them dead; he also would seem to be 
exactly the sort of trigger-happy boomjunkie who would be likely to 
make such a mistake first, and ask his lawyer to take questions 
later.  The other person's life would not enjoy the benefit of the 
doubt with him.  You can have him as a neighbor; I don't want him 
around me.

Are you being deliberately dense?  Since when was evolutionary selection a
voluntary process?

It doesn't matter whether or not criminals understand probability; they are
subject to it just the same.  By engaging in criminal activity they have
automatically subjected themselves to these selection pressures.  Some will
learn and some won't, but either way you have fewer criminals.

Japanese Research Team Succeeds in Creation of Reporter Molecule
Comline Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals

A research team comprising scientists from the University of Tokyo and
Kyushu Industrial University has succeeded in the creation of a so-called
"reporter molecule" with functions of information transmission through the
use of a fluorescent protein. The new technique is a method that will prove
useful in the simple measurement in real-time of molecular information
within cells, using cellular surfaces as the venue of information exchange
between inside and outside the cell. In order to create the reporter
molecule, the research group formed a certain yeast by implanting into the
interior of cells the genes with the marker reporter molecules. When
observing the cells in which the yeast had been cultivated after 24 hours
with a laser microscope, a ring or green light was observed on the surface
layer of the cells, indicating potential as a next-generation propagation
system for an information transfer environment between the interior and
exterior of cells.

SETI software reaches new heights
A quarter-million users rack up centuries of computer time
By Alan Boyle
MSNBC
      May 21   SETI@home has mushroomed into the worlds largest experiment
in distributed computing, just a week after its formal launch. More than a
quarter-million people have downloaded the software, which sifts through
radio data for messages from alien civilizations. More than 600 years of
computer time have been racked up in a week, with a years worth contributed

It doesn't render you a slave, but it makes you an easy mark for those that
would enslave you.  

The difference between a free man without a means to defend himself and a
slave is vanishingly small; they are separated only by random circumstance
that neither control.

The first draft of the human genome may be completed by next year
The San Diego Union-Tribune

 COLD SPRING HARBOR, N.Y. -- The publicly financed effort to decode the
human genome, the 3 billion units of DNA at the heart of every human cell,
is now 10 percent complete and is on track to meet its goal of finishing a
first draft of the genome a year from now, officials of the National
Institutes of Health said.

Decoding the genome, which holds the cell's genetic programming
instructions, is regarded as a fundamental step toward understanding the
design of the human body and its propensity to disease. Because all diseases
have a genetic component, knowledge of the genome's precise sequence of DNA
units should lead to fundamental advances in many branches of medicine.

Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health's share
of the human genome project, told scientists meeting at the Cold Spring
Harbor Laboratory that the impending completion of the genome represented a
"historic time in science."

"This is the most important organized scientific effort that humankind has
ever attempted," Collins said. "It dwarfs going to the moon."

His remarks were made in the presence of James D. Watson, who with Francis
Crick discovered the structure of DNA in 1953. As first director of the
Health Institutes' human genome project, Watson set its completion date as
2005, a goal he judged technically feasible.

Watson's hope of seeing his project produce a complete sequence of human DNA
within his lifetime faltered briefly last year when a newly formed private
company, [ Celera ] , announced that it would complete the human genome by
2001. For a few days, officials at the National Health Institutes seemed
inclined to cede the field to Celera and its aggressive leader, Dr. J. Craig
Venter. Venter has suggested that when he succeeds, the public consortium's
efforts will be seen as unnecessary.

But the institutes' efforts quickly resumed after their partner in the
public consortium, the richly endowed Wellcome Trust of London, said the
publicly financed effort should continue.

Wearing a canary yellow sweater and a floppy hat, Watson sat in front of the
audience as the progress of the genome-sequencing project was announced.
Collins projected onto a screen the first page of Watson's 1953 article in
the journal Nature, noting that if the decoding was completed by 2003, as
planned, exactly half a century would have elapsed between the two events.

Two-part plan

Collins also stressed the ideological difference between the two camps by
emphasizing the public consortium's goal of putting the human genome
sequence in the hands of the world's scientists as soon as possible, without
fees or restrictions. Celera does not plan to make all its sequence data
immediately available, although Venter has said scientists will have free
access to parts of it.

Venter's challenge to the public consortium preceded a recent centralization
of its efforts and a sharpening of focus. The various university sequencing
centers financed by the health institutes have been reduced to four, and the
smaller, less efficient centers have been cut out of the action.

The surviving centers now hold weekly conference calls and submit to a
certain amount of central planning, which they had previously avoided.

Besides moving up its target date for the complete genome sequence to 2003
from 2005, the public consortium has said it will produce a "first draft" --
90 percent of the sequence containing the majority of all human genes -- by
next spring.

The decision to produce and publish a first-draft DNA sequence may make it
harder for commercial ventures like Celera to lock up significant stretches
of the genome with patent claims.

But the decision carries a certain cost in that the two-stage process of
producing a first draft and then a complete sequence is less efficient than
finishing the whole sequence with no intermediate stage.

Vast unknowns

Despite the progress made since 1996, when human genome sequencing started
in earnest, its completion cannot be taken for granted. Both the ends and
the middles of human chromosomes, the units in which DNA is packaged,
consist of highly repetitive regions of DNA that may be hard to decode.

So far no human chromosome has been completed, although the long DNA
molecule, which is chromosome 22, has been half-sequenced and scientists
hope to finish it this year.

Sitting in his office after the meeting, Watson, who is president of the
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, called the public consortium's progress
"extremely satisfying."

One-third of the human genome sequence is to be finished by the Sanger
Center, near Cambridge, England. The next-largest contributor is
 Washington University ] in St. Louis. Last year the two centers finished
decoding the genome of the C. elegans roundworm as a pilot project for
tackling the human genome.

At a closed meeting here, where all parts of the genome were allocated to
various centers, it was agreed that a French group would sequence chromosome
14, Japanese scientists would do chromosome 18 and a German sequencing
center would complete chromosome 21.

"The genome belongs to the world," Watson said. "When it is being said that
this is the most important thing human beings have ever done, people want to
be part of it."

This was not the case when Watson first endorsed the idea of trying to
sequence the human genome in the late 1980s. Many scientists opposed the
effort, in part from fear that it would divert research funds from their own
projects.

Watson said he set 2005 as a conservative target date for fear that the
project might not receive the necessary funds. "When we set those dates, the
scientific community was not with us," he said.

IBM opens Deep Computing Institute

May 24  Big Blue, the nickname for International Business Machines Corp.,
the worlds largest computer maker, is setting out to prove not only how
wide, but how deep, its computing prowess has become.
        IN THE PAST YEAR, IBM has begun to lay out its vision of the future
based on pervasive computing  making computers more widely available by
embedding them in everyday objects and deep computing  using
supercomputer power to untangle some of the worlds thorniest computing
challenges.
       On Monday, the Armonk, N.Y.-based company said it will unveil its
Deep Computing Institute, a $29 million research effort to join academic and
industry researchers in a bid to use massive computational power to attack
complex problems.
       Deep computing techniques involve using supercomputer-scale machines,
advanced software and sophisticated mathematical formulas to enable
researchers to take on daunting scientific and commercial tasks that can
involve trillions of variables.
       The term deep computing was inspired by IBMs Deep Blue
chess-playing computer, which defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov
in 1996.
       William Pulleyblank, director of mathematical sciences at IBM
Research, will serve as director of the institute. The institute will be
guided by an advisory board of leaders from universities, government
laboratories and corporations.
 IBM is already a top maker of supercomputers  supplying more than 100 of
the worlds 500 largest supercomputers  but the company is pushing to widen
the use of the technology beyond academia to a range of new business
problems

         Deep computing combines the best of business and scientific
computing techniques to find the value buried in all this data and to apply
that information to solve real-world problems, Pulleyblank said in a
statement detailing the plan.
       Deep computing...can help find the proverbial needle in an entire
field of haystacks, analyzing vast reservoirs of data to uncover key
relationships between gene sequences needed to understand disease, he said,
using a biotechnology example.
       Supercomputers are the worlds fastest computers and allow
researchers to throw maximum data-crunching power at a single research
problem, or set of problems. Mainframes, their less powerful commercial
siblings, handle general purpose calculations but are less suited to such
intensive research.
       IBM is already a top maker of supercomputers  supplying more than
100 of the worlds 500 largest supercomputers  but the company is pushing
to widen the use of the technology beyond academia to a range of new
business problems.
       IBM is committing more than 120 scientists and technologists in eight
research labs in New York; San Jose, Calif.; Austin, Texas; Tokyo; Zurich,
Haifa, Israel; Beijing and New Delhi to the Deep Computing Institute
project.
       They will collaborate initially on deep computing projects in areas
ranging from how to schedule personnel in complex environments, such as
airline flights, and the modeling of precise weather patterns.
       Deep computing techniques are spurring advances in computer
optimization, simulation, visualization, and advanced pattern matching and
discovery in fields ranging from financial investment risk analysis to drug
research to oil discovery.
       Thanks to the tremendous advances in computing power and
mathematical algorithms, its now possible to tackle problems of
unbelievable complexity  things we couldnt dream of doing even a few years
ago, he said.
       As part of the project, the Deep Computing Institute will publish
over the Internet the IBM Visualization Data Explorer, a powerful software
package that can be used to analyze and create three-dimensional
representations of data.
       Data Explorer uses computational and 3-D graphics rendering tools in
a programmable framework that allows computer users to rapidly create visual
images, uncovering patterns, trends, and what-if scenarios hidden within
highly complex data.
       The product is used by a multinational bank to identify and manage
financial risk in portfolios worldwide. In energy exploration, it can depict
oil-flow simulations to improve drilling success rates and boost underground
reservoir yields.
       The underlying programming code for IBM Data Explorer will be given
away as open source software to researchers at the institutes Web site,
beginning May 26. The site will be located at
http://www.research.ibm.com/dci/software.html.

I avoid it in two ways; 1) by being a trained and responsible gun 
owner (I won a sharpshooting badge in the military), and 2) by 
trying to keep them out of the hands of those who are unlikely to 
show as much respect for them as I do, and especially those with 
a pronounced propensity to abuse them.

Well, I'm sure I don't need to mention the bells and whistles that go off 
when I read or hear " good of us all" : )

As to whether there is no other way, I'm not so sure. I haven't done a large 
amount of study on the issue, so my objection to gov enforcement of such bans 
basically rests on my previous post's points and a few other things that I 
won't list right now (tho I suppose I will later if asked : ). But I'd like 
to hear why you think there is no other way. 

I'll confess here that I'm coming from an anarchist perspective, so you can 
better iunderstand my points.

Sorry, I don't know the relevant statistics and haven't had time to check as
unfortunately I somewhat killed my computer this morning and have spent all
day repairing it. I'm sure they're available on the web. What I will say
though is that shooting incidents are rare enough that they can still make
national headlines, even if they result only in injuries (however minor/
serious) and not deaths. Obviously we too have had our occasional massacres,
the last of course being Dunblane, but these are *very* rare. So much so
that after the first of these occured at Hungerford in the 80's, by self
styled Rambo, Michael Ryan, it was greeted almost by sheer disbelief, by
people saying "But this isn't America; things like this just don't happen
here". And when a song was released after the event ('Lightening Strikes' by
The Seers - I shouldn't imagine anyone's ever heard of it but it's actually
pretty good) pointing out the hypocrisy/ knee-jerk reactions provoked by
both sides of the argument in such cases, it was immediately banned in a
typical knee-jerk reaction by those who automatically assumed it was
glorifying the event (which it most definitely wasn't), without ever
actually listening to it. And worse, perhaps, than the reactions to such
events in the USA are the calls not simply for guns to be banned, but for
violent films to be banned, violent computer games to be banned, violence in
TV shows to be banned, songs which allude to violence to be banned, and no
doubt, books with descriptions of violence to be immediately burned. I'm
sure you get the picture. Maybe in a less violent society our knees have
further to jerk (or our jerks have bigger knees) but the consequences for
personal and societal freedom can be far more horrific.

One interesting question has occasionally occured to me:

If the population of the UK was scaled up to match the population of the USA
would we find that the levels of violence or crime in general would be
similar despite our different systems of laws, or would there still be a
disproportionate level of crime in the USA (ie:  are such statistics a
product more of the systems under which we live, or a product of large,
economically and socially diverse or disparate populations)?

Also, just to clear the air: I do not have a problem with the debate on
property rights, what I was objecting to in my original post on this thread
was the increasing level of vitriol. I'd like to reiterate Greg Burch's
request for civility and - for now at least - letting the matter rest as far
as the guns side of the debate is concerned.

Sure there are - that's what mass detectors do.  You have to compute the
relativistic effects based on the measured mass, of course, but that's no
big deal.  We've already got instruments that can pick up a mass of around
50 tons at a distance of a couple of miles, which ought to be good enough
for even really picky measurements.

I've found SOME of the ads informative/useful; BUT, for the most part, I 
agree--they are a bit of a NUISANCE!

He said he would shoot someone who came to take his weapon.  In
what way could he mistake their intentions?  It is the invaders
with badges and and a bad law on their side who are the agressors
here, not our citizen, for whom you have not the slightest bit
of evidence of any agressiveness at all (take me for example:
I've said such things many times and will again, but I've never
raised a hand in anger in my life, much less a weapon).  If such
a badged invader were to break down the man's door, announce
himself and head for the guns, he'd be getting exactly what such
a barbarian deserves, "orders" notwithstanding.

Attacking my means of protecting my life is no different from
attacking my life, and should be met with the same resistance.

The latter.

Well having the funds that are donated used for funding research
would seem to me to be harder to do. I mean, the people donating
are going to probably want status reports and the like, that
besides wasting the researchers' time, would require more time
from me to keep the site updated. I'm thinking more of something
simpler and more automated, where all I have to do is write a
check from the non-profit's bank account if someone meets the
criteria for a prize. And yes, by that point they might not need
the money, but who knows- they could use the cash to go off and
work on something really radical that maybe the VCs wouldn't want
to fund?

Some solid, empirical research is always nice to check-out.  I suggest that 
both the "gun-nuts" AND "anti-gun nuts" check out Prof. John Lott's new 
book, MORE GUNS, LESS CRIME (U. of Chicago Press, 1998).  I personally am 
somewhat ambivalent on this issue (as I am also, e.g., on abortion) but 
ultimately I tend to be a rather strong 2nd Amendment person, and favor 
right-to-carry laws (though, admittedly, from a common-law/libertarian 
perspective such legislation--except when rationalized as "codification"--is 
rather jurisprudentially redundant).  Also important is just about any 
article or book by Stephen Halbrook, such as ...THAT EVERY MAN BE ARMED 
(Independent Institute, 1992); he also has a excellent discussion of what is 
and ISN'T covered by the 2nd Amendment in an article (can't recall the 
title) appearing in the Journal, Contemporary Legal Issues back in the 
mid-80's (1986, I think, but I'm not certain, and can't get the cite at this 
moment.

Best regards to all!

There has to be a central recordkeeping resource to ascertain 
whether or not a prospective gun purchaser is underage, mentally 
deficient and/or deranged, a spouse and/or child abuser, or a 
violent criminal, as well as penalties for breaking such laws, and 
enforcement of the penalties; otherwise they would be useless 
scraps of paper.  As far as anarchy goes, postulated that you have 
a society of people with private property in close proximity with 
limited resources, and your goal is to maximize the freedoms of all, 
then your standard is that all people who are capable of assuming 
responsibility for the free exercise of their choices should have all 
freedoms that all others do, and in the cases of inevitable conflict, 
these should be resolved by equal and proportional compromise.  
Right away, you need an executive or enforcement branch to keep 
bullies from illicitly imposing their wills on others, a judicial branch 
to decide what is equal and proportional in each specific case, and 
a legislative to both set general standards for the judiciary to 
interpret in specific cases, and to enact refinements and additions 
so that the laws may evolve with changing circumstances.  You will 
nweed a core document, or constitution, which clearly enumerates 
the inalienable rights to which all citizens are to be entitled, 
including minorities, and you need to allow the people at large to 
monitor the fairness and competency of those holding the positions 
whose responsibility it is to legislate, enforce and judge, and to 
expel and replace them at will; a popular vote.

Bullets do not delineate a coherent fitness landscape; they'll kill 
anyone, fat or thin, old or young, strong or weak, male or female, 
smart or dumb, indiscriminately.  There is no selection going on

If he becomes deranged enough to brandish his weapon

begins doing so, is dumb enough not to realize that pull trigger = 
forever dead, or intent upon murdering a specific person (say, his 
wife or one of his children) then by all means gun his ass down,

They are finally updating the ranking again, and we are now off
the top 100 teams! We could really use another 20 people on
the team. I know there are at least 20 more people out there;
come on and give it a try, the link is in my sig.

That's a reasonable statement of position.  The comment (I realize
it was not by you) that I objected to was that our theoretical
citizen who had done nothing but express the opinion that anyone
coming to take his gun was in grave danger was, by virute of this
quite reasonable statement alone, also worthy of having that right
denied him.  Your position, that one must actually have had some
proven history of violence to deny that right is more justifiable,
though some definitions of "mentally deficient" or "abusive" and
even "child" may be wide enough to drive a truck through.  Many
such restrictions are of course already in place and don't do a
damned thing to reduce violence, but I they are generally not too
objectionable to the NRA and other advocates.  What they object to
is the more draconian proposals like universal registrations, bans
on specific weapons, etc.

The point in the novel, which was not all that humorous (can hardly
imagine Lem even cracking a smile), was to give someone who
probably didn't have a chance to live that chance.  I could see
someone, say, running out of air in space choosing cryosuspension
over suffocation and rotting.

A few related observations, in no particular order:

Prohibitions against weapons of mass destruction are on a different level
from prohibitions against weapons of personal defense. A full machine gun
might be appropriate in some areas of our cities, where the police even
fear to patrol, for instance. This is one reason that the cops HAVE such
weapons.

Thermonuclear weapons are expensive and high-maintainance, not to mention
that some small components are only available to those owning a breeder
reactor.

Biological agents are there for the taking for anyone with the knowledge to
do so. No laws will ever stop someone desiring anthrax or botulinin from
getting it, or breeding it, or spreading it. It's like laws prohibiting
certain weeds from growing. Nature does not care.

Chemical weapons share some of the same problems as nukes, but again, a
good sophomore chemistry student can make the stuff if he really wants to.

The problem with laws in the US is that without a specific 'law' against
the ownership of each of the mentioned items, some sharp lawyer will be
able to convince a judge and jury that his client found in possession of
same is innocent. Look at the way new drug laws must continually be passed
to cover every new analog of an old favorite. Change the molecule, the
stuff is no longer illegal until the lawmakers can pass a new law.

Assault weapons were 'banned' here in the last few years. Now you ask for a
'sport' or 'target' rifle, not an AR15 - but it fires the same ammo as the
AR15, and looks just like it. All that is missing is the bayonet lug.
Bayonets are banned - you can go to federal prison for putting a bayonet
lug on a sport rifle.

'Saturday night specials', cheap revolvers, were also banned. So revolvers
got expensive, and cheap and dangerous (to the user!) automatic pistols
took their place. The automatics are not what is defined as 'saturday night
specials'. Another law on the books with little real effect.

I wish the gun control advocates would start concentrating on CONTROL
rather than prohibition. Control who gets legal access to a firearm, and
you can safely allow that person to carry his/her weapon in public, as now
the gun owner is 'certified' to carry and use the gun. Sort of like having
lots of unpaid deputy cops on the street. This is the basis of the
concealed carry laws on the books in many states. I would extend the
testing and certification to ALL weapons buyers. Preventing unstable or
criminal persons from legally owning a gun is just common sense.

The comment that 'when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns' is
self evident. If all legal sources of firearms were to be closed tomorrow
throughout the US, and all law-abiding citizens were to turn in their
weapons, I estimate it would take organized crime about two microseconds to
begin large scale gunrunning into the cities - and I mean a few orders of
magnitude greater than we already have. The drugrunners and the gangbangers
would rule the cities in short order - or we would need a true police state
to prevent it.

What happened in Colorado would have happened in the absence of guns - the
bombs would have been triggered first, rather than the shooting spree.
People with a yen to commit mass murder will always find a way.

There are existing laws to deal with the straw buyer problem - use these
laws to deal with the criminals as they are found. Similarly, when a
criminal is found with a weapon, PUT THE SUMBITCH IN JAIL and take him/her
off the streets. Law-abiding people with guns are never a threat to public
safety.

Contrary to popular belief, anyone in the US who can pass the background
check and pay the federal licensing fees can legally buy any kind of gun
they want, from the smallest pistol through true machine guns and cannons.
Use of these devices is regulated by law. Despite this, we do not see an
epidemic of machine gun or cannon massacres in the US. 

Even with the existing gun laws, recently a small machine shop here was
busted by the Feds. The owners had produced thousands of unserialized,
illegal, automatic pistols for sale to whoever had the cash. Most of the
guns are still out there...

Thanks for the soapbox.

Here is an excerpt from an editorial in the local Atlanta paper
today discussing what the author believe is the real reason for
the growing kid violence in the US. I agree with it...
----------------------------------------------------------------
Hard question follows kid killers
---------------------------------
by Leonard Pitts

(discussing how when asked, kids blame bullies and other known
 facts of high school life, and how these things have not
 changed in the past 50 years) ...

  "So what's changed isn't school, but some of the students who go
there.
   Who are these children? It's a question I find myself asking
with increasing frequency. A question that unavoidably attends
not just the recent rush of random killing by schoolyard shooters,
but also the equally troubling string of infancticides by secretly
pregnant teen mothers.
   An answer seems to lie in the very mundaneness of their
motivations: in the mother who explains that she killed her baby
to avoid embarrassment or the shooter who says he went on the
rampage because he lost his girl or was picked on by a bully.
   Who are these children?
   But it seems obvious, doesn't it? These are the children of
entitlement. These are the children who were never shamed enough,
blamed enough, held accountable enough, or told "no" enough to
understand that the world does not orbit around them nor exist
for their immediate gratification.
   These are the children for whom an excuse has always been
found, a way always made, a shortcut always carved, the children
who have never had to bear the consequences of their own actions
upon their own shoulders.
   These are the children of the new age, the one wherein parents
worried so much - too much, I think - about bruising self-esteem.
As a result, these are the children who fall apart like a house of
cards in a hurricane the moment life deals them a hard slap or two.
   The problem is that life doesn't give a damn about self-esteem.
Life just does what life will and demands that you deal with it or
not. Too many children do not. Cannot. Because they're not tough
enough.
   These children are a reminder that our job as parents, teachers,
and elders is not to smooth the way but to teach a child to walk
safely in the rough places. It's a job we need to approach more
assiduously than we do.
   Because ultimately, the answer to the question is chilling in
its simplicity: Who are these children?
   They are tomorrow."

Perhaps in the case of a free criminal who kills an unarmed man with his
illegally obtained weapon. What about the man who defends his life and wins
against the same criminal?

We might do good to ask any cryonics or cryobiology expects if anyone
has already done some work on this.  Even if they have, there's no
reason not to also try inventing something like this.

     Have you any idea how deranged you sound to non-Americans like me?  You definitely do NOT speak for us "non-Americans" (now there's a group without common opinions if ever I heard of one).  If it hadn't been for the example of freedom which America once represented, democracy would have taken a hell lot longer to achieve here in Europe (and don't give me the french for chrissakes).

     The U. S. A. is flawed as a country, but its constitution (if only it were respected) is a far better basis for a country than any other I know of.  Perhaps you know of a country with a better constitution than the American?

     Exactly what parts of the constitution do you think we should discard as being outdated?  The freedom of speech?  The right of people to assemble peacefully?  The freedom of religion?  The right, when accused of a crime, to be informed of the nature and the cause of the accusation, the right to a speedy and public trial?  The right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures?  (which is not respected by federal law enforcement agencies)  

     The constitution is not America's problem.  The problem is that with every year America deviates more and more from the ideas and ideals set out in the constitution.

     Don't tell me that you have never heard of self-defence?  Or perhaps you regard self-defence as morally reprehensible?  It seems that self-defence doesn't really have anything to do with the constitution either.  I'd be in favour of self-defence even if it were un-constitutional.  It's a matter of ethics. 

     A concerned non-American (involuntary non gun owner.  Give me liberty and I'll get me a 1911 in a jiffy.  Obviously, I hope I would never have to use it against people, but to me it seems preferable to have a gun and never needing it, to needing a gun and not having it).

Legal gun owners, demographically, have the lowest incidence of violent crime of
any demographic group. We set the standard of non-violence that the rest of the
so-called non-violent pacifistic culture can't seem to meet. You're statement
about 'enslaving oneself to a gun' is rather pathetic, since: a) you can't
enslave yourself to an inanimate object, b) if you could, IMHO that would be by
choice, and is far far better than becoming forcibly enslaved to the
government/criminal terrocrat industry.

A gun is a technological tool, like any other tool (i.e. a PC, a cell phone,
nanotech, brain implants, cryonic suspension, etc) is merely a means to greater
freedom and ability for the individual, which is exactly what extropy is all
about. Government has no interest in giving you greater freedom, only in taking
it away. It has no interest in giving you greater ability, as that is a threat
to its own power. Un-extropic individuals hate us and the things we stand for.
They will not stop at mere legal maneuvers to prevent us from acheiving our
goals.

Longevity is another extropian value. Non-gun-owners have a higher mortality
rate than gun owners.

Hmm, perhaps I'm too charitable by nature; I'm still willing to posit that Joe
would like to see the level of violence decrease.  In all fairness, Joe seems to
favor gun ownership in general, except for his personal list of classes of people
he wouldn't trust with them (there's a whole other topic here....).  Why he feels
the need to hurl insults and profanity is beyond me, however.  (Note to the
unsure:  doing so does *not* increase the credibility of your statements!)

The interesting thing for me is how, for some people, issues like this become
religious, by which I mean a person will take a conclusion (however arrived at)
and keep it safe from any evidence or reasoning that would tend to discredit it.
This is the solution of the Catholic church officials to Galileo's evidence of
non-Earth-centric planetary motion--refuse to see the evidence and cling to the
conclusion.

Several times evidence and reasoning have been presented here that strongly
suggest that legal concealed carry leads to a safer society.  I have yet to see
anyone offer evidence that counters this claim; I can only conclude this is
because they can't.  Yet they cling to a view that, according to the only
available evidence, would actually increase the level of violence in society--the
direct opposite of their stated preference.  Whenever someone points out that
their recommendations, however well-meaning, will surely result in increased
death and destruction, the reaction typically is to try to silence the evidence
(toasted Galileo?).  A modern example is the threats of death and violence
received by Dr. Lott after publishing his findings (made by people supposedly
opposed to violence???).  Perhaps someone with a grounding in psychology can
explain the phenomenon; it leaves me puzzled.

I'd be interested in seeing that also.  My main point here, of course, is that

There is an important discrimination: bullets will kill anyone _who is

I dunno.. what I find interesting is their FAQ claims that
dual-processors won't be used, but my dual machines seem to
waay faster than my single (i.e. single PII is taking over 60hrs
of time per unit, but dual PIII is chewing through them in 12).

The first laws limiting gun ownership from certain groups were as follows:

In the US, blacks could not own guns in many jursidictions under the KKK enforced Jim
Crow laws right up until the Civil Rights Act, and the Gun Control Act of 1968.

In 1928, in response to 'gang violence' between Nazi and Communist mobs, the
center-right elected government in Germany passed the first german gun control law,
making discretionary permits and registration required at all levels of gun and
ammunition manufacture, transportation, sales, use, and destruction.

Mental defectives or others under trusteeship, violators of a whole list of criminal
statutes (even if sentences were commuted), Gypsies and other itinerants, those under
20 years of age, and people under police supervision and other persons who have lost
their civil rights, were all banned from gun ownership.

When Hitler and the Nazis won 44 percent of the vote in the early 30's, with 265 seats
in parliament, and the Nationalists had an additional 44 seats as well, giving Hitlers
coalition a slim 16 seat majority, Hitler knew he could not survive another vote, so he
had to have martial law declared. Using the 1928 law, they were able over several years
to refuse to renew the permits of all political opponents and Jews, until in March of
1938 they passed their new Reichsgeletsblatt Waffenglets (National Law Book, Weapons
Law) which did the following:

a) banned Jews from the firearms business
b) Handguns were singled out for special controls (just like the Brady Law)
c) Nazi Party organizations were exempted from 'gun control' (just like politicians are
exempted now from gun control laws)
d) Anyone "who it is feared may endanger the public safety," could be barred from
owning any type of weapon. (just like the domestic violence weapons laws now)
e) It was prohibited to possess .22 caliber cartridges with hollow point, hollow caity,
or notched bullets.( just like the current "cop killer" bullet laws now)

On November 10th, 1938 a German diplomat in Paris was shot by a Jewish political
protester. This event triggered Kristallnacht, the night of broken glass, where
synagogues and jewish owned businesses all over Germany were pillaged, smashed, and
burned. At least several hundred Jews were killed. The next day, the new
Reichsgeletsblatt Waffengelets was issued, and Jews were specifically banned from
owning any weapons. Ordinary Germans, who were now themselves disarmed, were unable to
oppose the terrocrat activities of the Gestapo and the Waffen SS troops who helped the
Nazi party regulars with running Kristallnacht. Thousands of Jews were arrested and
sent to Concentration camps... you know the rest.

I will submit that this lends great weight to the argument that World War II and the
Holocaust were able to happen directly because of Germany's gun control laws.

In 1968, Senator Thomas Dodd (father of current Senator Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.)) was
the chairman of the Subcommittee on Juvinile Delinquency, a subcommittee of the
Judiciary Committee. Senator Dodd had been a prosecutor at Nuremburg after the war, and
although it was not a part of any of the cases he handled, he somehow got a copy of the
Nazi Weapons Law. In 1968 he gave this to a translator at the Legislative Research
Service to translate into english. It has been conclusively shown that the Gun Control
Act of 1968, that Senator Dodd's committee submitted to the Senate, was an accurate
translation of the Nazi Weapons Law, as adapted for our different legal system, and was
only missing the requirements for a national gun owner registration system and a
national concealed weapons permit system. It was from the Nazi law that the concept of
'sporting purpose' was borrowed (and is now one of the mantras of Handgun Control Inc
to condemn effective self defense weapons). For 30 years now we have been living under
Nazi laws in this country.

So Joe Dees, how does it feel to be in the company of the Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan?
You are, you know.

Joe, I agree that keeping weapons out of the hands of convicted
felons is often a good idea. Many laws exist which purport to
support that aim, but they seem to be ineffective.  Do you have any
useful suggestions on how those laws could be enforced such that
they have some useful positive impact?

I gather the impression that, unlike many "ban the gun" advocates,
you don't mind gun ownership by non-felons, and you own weapons
yourself.  Sadly it appears that most mass shooters are not
convicted felons *at the time they commit their attacks*, and
banning the possession of guns by _potential_ shooters would require
massive infringements of civil rights- for who can identify a
potential shooter?  Psychological screening for firearms purchases? 
The possibilities for political abuse of such a system would be
large.

External cooling is negligeable if you can cool by liquid ventilation

There might be a fieldable liquid CPR unit forthcoming. You _need_
surgery for perfusion though, so there is no point in having a machine.

OK, by "readily available" I meant legalized concealed carry.  Available to law-abiding
citizens.

I also found it significant that Lott began the study expecting to validate the
gan-banners' preconceptions, but had the intellectual honesty to believe what the data
told him.

My main point was to find out if anyone is even interested in evidence here.  So far
I've seen evidence backing the increased benefits to society of gun ownership, but none
for gun banning.  No one has officially asked (on this list anyway) if someone knows of
such evidence, so I thought I'd step forward.

The Insta-check system is such a system. However, the FBI and ATF is using this
system to keep records like a registration system, which is against both law and
the constitution. I don't mind insta-check that much, so long as my record of
purchase gets deleted. NOTE: The feds have not prosecuted one person since the
Insta-check system was instituted for illegal attempted purchase of a firearm. Its
been working for a year now. Paper tigers, anyone?

Not at all. There is absolutely no reason all of these functions cannot be
satisfied under the insurance/PPA/PPL model for a libertarian/free market anarchy
society. Those that wish to live in no-right-to-carry communities can do so, and
their PPA will enforce that wish under their standard contracts. I suggest you
research this area before you baldly state that only a government can do this.

You are defining defending oneself against a confiscatory opressive government as
attacking? I make the same warning: Anyone, I mean ANYONE, who tries to come and
confiscate my guns will not live to see the sun set. That will not be an attack, it
will be a defense, and an effective one. Confiscating guns not only violates the 2nd
amendment, but the 4th, 5th, and 9th.

Moreover, on your inclusion of spousal/child abusers in your confiscatory regieme, what
standards will you have of what abuse is as well as what the burden of evidence and
standards of due process will be? As they stand now, the abuse regs are very weak and
do not give very good protection to the accused.

No, a person who shouldn't have a gun gets quickly dead. A free man is not free
unless armed.

The largest study done that shows evidence for gun control was a study of five hand picked
counties at different times, that demonstrated that crime went up. It was such a small
sample that in each case the increase in crime was attributable to a single individual or
gang in that jurisdiction on a continuous string of crimes. I don't recall the name of the
person who did the study, but she was the person who called Prof. Lott's study 'flawed'. I
know he mentions her in the back of his book.

It is an interesting cognitive malfunction, present in many, including
creationists, legislators, and poker players.  Humans tend to believe
what they would like to believe, regardless of the evidence.  Some can
even know what the rational conclusion is and /still/ cling to what
they want to believe.  There are many trained doctors who tout worthless
herbs or homepathic crap despite years of education in how to properly
evaluate a drug.  Many a poker player can tell you that ey is precisely
an 11-to-1 underdog to fill that straight, but ey will call the bet
anyway because of a hunch ("I can feel it coming").  I paid my rent by
exploiting them, and they kept coming back to the table despite the
mounds of cash they spent chasing those hunches. 

Dawkins makes an interesting argument that credulity is an advantage
for children, and to some extent it may have been for adults as well
during most of our evolutionary history.  I haven't found a cure yet,
but I have seem people make the transition so I know it can be done.
I wonder how you would go about measuring it?

Wouldn't Robert Forward's Mass Detector work? Space time curvature is
equivalent to mass is it not?

A mass detector is a spinning symmetrical set of heavy weights that are quite
heavy relative to the arms they are mounted on. The masses are attracted to
any outside mass, deforming the arms. This causes the whole set up to vibrate
if it is rotating, which is good because vibrations are easier to detect then
the tiny variances in the angles of the arms caused by the masses being
attracted to the outside mass.

I'm not sure how clear that was. I'll try a diagram.

O   O
 \    /
   V
   /\                        O
 /   \
O   O

The "X" shaped setup is monuted to spin around it's center.
At any given time, the 2 mases on teh arms closest to the exterior mass are
attracted more strongly then the other two masses. This deforms the arm,
inducing vibrations at the hub. Apparently Dr. Forward has built working
models that have considerable accuracy.

As an aside, are we attempting to detect spacetime curvature due to mass, or
other types of spacetime curvature? (ARE there any other types of spacetime
curvature, and wouldn't they be equivalent to mass?)

I came across this today....

Why does the fed gov't push for new laws when it doesn't enforce the ones it
already has?

Gun Groups Press For Enforcement

By SALLY BUZBEE / Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gun murders in Richmond, Va., fell by 41 percent after
prosecutors there started an effort to put any felon caught carrying a gun in
prison for five years.

So why doesn' t the Clinton administration follow that model nationwide, the
National Rifle Association and other gun control opponents want to know. Federal
prosecutors could crack down on gun crime by enforcing the laws already on the
books, rather than pushing for new ones, they say.

As Congress debates a slate of gun control proposals that gained support from
lawmakers after the Littleton, Colo., high school shootings, the question of
whether the federal government does enough to enforce those existing laws has
re-emerged as a key dispute. Republicans were expected to grill Clinton
administration officials on the issue at a hearing today.

" You can talk about the culture of violence for the next 10 years. Unless you
start prosecution, you' re never going to cut the culture of violence, " said Glen
Caroline, director of the NRA' s grassroots division.
 Since President Clinton took office, federal prosecutions of gun-related crimes
have dropped more than 40 percent, the NRA says. The nation has a zero-tolerance
policy against young people bringing guns to school, for example, yet the federal
government prosecuted just eight children for that in the last two years, says
James Baker, the group' s chief lobbyist.

 But the Clinton administration says gun groups use the wrong statistics, looking
only at the drop in prosecutions since 1992, when violent crime overall and thus
prosecutions began to drop after historic highs.

Gun groups also ignore the recent federal efforts to work with local police to
prevent illegal gun sales, and to go after those who commit crimes with guns and
the dealers who illegally supply them, the administration says.

" It is disingenuous for them to criticize when they are looking at the wrong
numbers," said Justice Department spokesman Brian Steel, who says federal, state
and local prosecutions combined are on the increase.

 In addition, federal laws often are meant more to prevent gun violence -- by
keeping felons from buying guns, for example -- than as tools for prosecutors. The
Brady Law' s instant background checks have prevented 250, 000 felons from buying
guns, Steel says.

And some crimes, such as those by teen-agers and children, are simply better
handled by local authorities, said Attorney General Janet Reno, herself a former
state attorney from Dade County, Fla. Nevertheless, officials do plan to review "
just what needs to be done with state and local authorities to ensure the
appropriate prosecution of these cases, " she said last week.

Even gun-control advocates, however, say more could be done. The Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms should be more aggressive in putting out of business any
licensed gun dealer who breaks federal rules, says Douglas Weil, research director
for the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence.

The program begun in Richmond, called Project Exile and praised by the NRA in
newspaper ads and before Congress, has dominated much of the debate. Rochester,
N.Y., also has signed on.

Clinton praised the program in a March radio address with Richmond' s police chief
at his side, but the NRA complains that the Clinton administration isn' t providing
money to duplicate the effort nationwide.

" We want to give cities the flexibility to do whatever works in their community, "
Steel said. " Richmond had a particular problem with convicted felons getting guns.
Boston had a problem with gangs. They used different strategies, and they both had
success."

Indeed, the Boston program that started in 1995, tracing where young criminals got
their guns, became a precursor of the ATF effort to trace guns used in juvenile
crime -- a program Clinton is expanding.

 A bill the Senate passed last week includes a measure that would revoke gun
ownership rights for anyone convicted as a juvenile of a firearms crime, would
institute new background checks at gun shows and pawn shops and would require that
safety devices be sold with all new handguns. The House is expected to take up
similar proposals in mid-June.

Yet even as lawmakers consider such new restrictions, some insist the focus should
be on enforcement, perhaps by giving more money to police and to federal
prosecutors or to gun-safety education programs.

" To really maximize our impact ... we' ve got to prosecute the laws we' ve got, "
said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala.

I would recommend that you actually examine some of the evidence compiled by
Professor Lott.  If you see that your precepts are inaccurate, perhaps you will
change them.

I assume you meant "can be argued".  The problem I see is, who gets to draw up the list?
(Hint: think "politicians".)  We have your list above.  If we add other peoples'
categories, we would surely have to add members of the KKK, pro-lifers (no conflict there
eh? :-), skinheads, etc.  Probably anyone with a drug history, then anyone with a
criminal record.  Surely anyone who's advocated anarchy or lbertarianism.  In fact, just
to be safe, probably anyone who doesn't "need" one for their "official government
duties", which brings us back to the present: the banners' stated goal of taking
everyone's guns away.

Another thing:  presumably convicted violent criminals are listed because you do not
believe they are rehabilitated.  The question here is the same as with Megan's law:  if
these people are still dangerous, why on earth are they being placed back into society?
The question in my mind is not whether they should have guns, but how have we determined
that they are (1) dangerous and (2) should be set free?  Considering that lethal weapons
are not hard to find (cars, bricks, knives, bats, crossbows, hammers, etc. etc.) I do not
feel especially comforted even if they are prevented from obtaining guns (which they are
not, regardless of the law).

I apply precisely the same logic to wife/child abusers and the mentally ill.

Children are an interesting topic.  Like adults, some are eminently trusthworthy (I know
several personally) and some are not (I know several personally).  The gov't's own
studies show that the rate of shootings (deliberate and accidental) committed with guns
is far lower among children who have been trained in proper usage of firearms than it is
among those who have not.  I would tend towards a position of holding the parents
responsible for their child committing a shooting; it might tend to increase the parents'
motivation to properly train and educate their kids.  Accrediting agencies offering
courses may be another route to such education.  (Also keep in mind that I am referring
to actual children; I will not commit the gov't's distortion of including teenage
gang-bangers as children for the purpose of skewing gun crime statistics.)

I mention all this mainly in an attempt to illustrate that "reasonable and rational" will
be interepreted differently by different people, and no doubt get lost entirely (as is
traditional) in the political process.

If guns are generally available to law-abiding citizens, those who initiate violence
against them, with or without guns, will find their numbers dwindling over time.  A
little process called natural selection.  Society will become safer as result.  I think
that result, a safer society, is what most "gun nuts" are, and should be, focused on.
Your tactic of ascribing evil motives to others does nothing to advance your argument
rhetorically, and much to diminish it.

Just as an exercise, the next time someone responds to a proposal by saying "I don't
think it will work," try considering that perhaps they _actually don't think it will
work_, rather than assuming they're looking for excuses to use their guns.

Perhaps the requirement to be armed and to be willing to kill is not
freedom.

Give 'em a break, they're doing something positive, no matter what you
think of chances of success. Hell, my PC idle time would have been
wasted anyway.

Although it still is, because apparently I can't use port 80 or some

and you have a good likelyhood of people suffocating to death in a

might get rescued.

Of course no one on this list would be so foolish.

I have heard from some other people that they also have had
trouble getting the software going. If anyone figures out the
trick to getting it to work please let the list know. Perhaps
this proxy stuff will be improved soon when they release the
1.1 version of the clients.

If you have downloaded the SETI software from their main page
at setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu and got it running, then you
should have an account setup now under your email address.
They assign you a random password, which you will need to
retrieve using the "forgot your password?" link on the group
signup page. Let me know if you still have problems...

Yes, I believe Gene was referring to your indication that you were to attend

see messages on this list other than badly argued positions about property

Due to the interest and empathy for the Bailey statements, I'll elaborate a
little more. My flight landed just in time for the friday night reception.
We all met at the knowhere store. We were told to retrieve our name tags and
were allowed to mingle for a while. We were then informed of our tasks,
select a few groups to be involved in for each of the following days. These
included topics from MEMEs to biotech, I don't want to divulge to much
information, only because there may be more that evolves out of our meeting.
I was overstimulated, of course that's a good thing. I met some interesting
people there, and heard some solutions thrown out verbally across a room
that were impressive. Some idea's were just worked out into it's realistic
place, even one of mine I realized in conversation wouldn't work. We closed
with some predictions for the future and one person at a time spoke a report
of what had been achieved their group. I was glad to be there.There were
computers and great food all over, the motel was nice too. Merkle was
informative, and entertaining, Drexler, well what can I say, one to never
forget!! Gina "Nanogirl" Miller

Yes, thanks Doug.  Every time these viruses get loose on extropians,
I try to get scarce for a while.  {8^D

Has anyone here thought out this meme: perhaps the *most* important
influences in our lives are not family and friends, but the books we
read as children?  These plant memes early, when they have the
most impact on our developing synaptic interconnections.

Extropians started down this road at least once before I think, then
were distracted by whizzing bullets.

The question was "If one book, which and why?"
Someone argued that if the question is interpreted as which
book had the most *impact*, it might well be a Dr. Seuss
work, or equivalent.  This notion might explain a few things at least
in my case.  {8^D  spike

Sounds to me like one of those "Hey, Old People!" comics from Tom the
Dancing Bug.  The actual research on this subject would appear to show
that the key factor in school violence is not low self-esteem, or high
self-esteem, but the combination of (1) low self-esteem and (2) the
belief that self-esteem should be higher.  So it is in point of fact
true that the Clueless People, psychiatrists and social workers, are
screwing up the nation's youth.  But that's been an experimentally
established fact for years.  Let's not make it worse by shoving things
in an equally-clueless-but-opposite direction.

Whose fault is the second shooting?  Not the video games.  Not the
violent TV shows.  The news shows.  The tear-jerkers.  The ones who made
a big huge deal out of it and interviewed the survivors and showed the
Congresspeople making speeches.  The ones who glamorized it, in other
words.  I find it particularly ironic that the Senate's bill was
punctuated by another shooting and nobody seemed to think the two might
be related.

New devices can identify just about any part of you

By MARY DEIBEL

(May 28, 1999 12:16 a.m. EDT http://www.nandotimes.com) - Principal Patricia
Wagner of Lavaland Elementery School in Albuquerque has been a big believer
in biometrics since a machine that can "read" the shape of a hand stopped a
father who had lost a custody fight from spiriting his child away.
Not only do hand-readers help insure student safety, Wagner says, but the
machines are easy to use.
Hand-readers like the ones the Albuquerque schools use are made by
Recognition Systems of Campbell, Calif., and are being used for everything
from controlling entry to a Los Angeles sperm bank to clocking lawyer's
hours in Manhattan.
The machines are part of a new generation of devices that identify people by
face, fingers, eyes and voice as well as hands and then use biometric
techniques to take the computerized measure of a man or woman according to
individual characteristics of various body parts.
Once the stuff of science fiction and spy thrillers, biometrics are moving
into the mainstream, with the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service
the most prolific user, according to Jeffrey Dunn, head of the government's
Biometrics Consortium.
Due to a 1996 change in U.S. law in which Congress ordered the INS to use
biometric technologies to identify aliens, INS programs now:
--Use voice verification systems at remote Canadian border crossings so
agents up to 45 miles away can conduct inspections and ask questions before
opening the gates.

--Test face and speaker recognition systems on a dedicated car lane at the
main border crossing with Mexico near San Diego. The project has cut
frequent commuters' time in line to a one-minute delay at a time when
peak-hour crossing can take up to two hours.

--Let 85,000 frequent fliers abroad bypass long lines at busy airports by
using an automated hand reader in airport kiosks.

The latest figures show the government is the biggest user of biometrics to
date, spending $140 million on body-reading equipment last year compared to
$33 million for private industry.
Besides the INS and defense and intelligence agencies commonly thought to
employ this sort of James Bond gadgetry, states including Arizona,
California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and
Texas use fingerprinting and other biometric techniques to detect and deter
welfare fraud.
But in a high-tech world in which keys can be lost, PIN numbers forgotten,
and mother's maiden names purloined by determined identity thieves, analysts
predict private industry will quickly turn body-parts-as-passwords into a
$1-billion-a-year business.
High-tech trend-watchers at the Gartner Group of Stamford, Conn., expect
biometrics to be one of the technologies "that will change everything from
the way we run our business to the way we conduct our personal lives" in the
21st century.
The key at the moment is getting businesses to integrate biometrics into
their products, says Gartner Group's Jackie Fenn, who expects business to
pick up by the end of the year, when Compaq and other computer-makers start
bundling fingerprint identifiers and other biometric devices into their
overall PC package.
Biometric techniques debuting in May alone at the CardTech/SecuriTech
convention in Chicago and elsewhere include Bank United of Texas' trial run
for cameras capable of reading the irises of the eyes of ATM users at three
branches in Houston, Dallas and Fort Worth.
To show the machines are fast, friendly and foolproof, the bank had
identical twins Michael and Richard Swartz try each other's ATM cards, only
to be turned down. "We can confuse tellers, but we can't confuse the
machine," Michael Swartz told reporters.
The camera reads 266 reference points on an iris - the colored part of the
eye surrounding the pupil - and then digitizes the photograph and sends the
image to a computer for verification of the eyeball's owner in seconds.
The system is made by Sensar Inc., a private, for-profit spin-off of the
Sarnoff labs in Princeton, N.J., where high-definition and color TV were
born.
Britain's largest thrift, Nationwide Building Society, has used the Sensar
system for two years and a recent survey of its customers found that 91
percent approve. Trials also are under way in Japan, Norway and Turkey.
But analysts say the iris verification system is costly, adding as much as
$5,000 to the $35,000 price tag for a single ATM machine. Banks may consider
it worth the money for certain ATMs, but for other businesses and other
applications, less costly alternatives are likely to prove more popular even
if they assure a slightly lower level of accuracy, security and
accountability.
Competing technologies include:

--A new, computerized fingerprint technology that gets high marks based on
plates of fingertip whorls embedded on super-hard silicon chips full of
sensors that use multi-point digitized match-ups.

One system developed by Verdicom of Santa Clara, Calif., a joint effort by
Lucent Technologies and its venture capital partners, can disable a laptop
computer unless the computer keyboard recognizes the user's fingerprints.

A second system by Identix of Sunnyvale, Calif., adapts to a range of
products from mobile phones to credit cards and is considered so promising
that Motorola has just teamed up with Identix to bring the technology to
market.

A third system by American Biometric, a Canadian firm, is called BioMouse
Plus and uses fingerprint scanners to trap unwary users of corporate
computer networks.

--Digital signatures that let users record a cyber-signature for
autographing digital documents or signing themselves onto a secure Internet
site.

The system developed by Cyber-Sign of Newport Beach, Calif., works by having
a user sign an input tablet three times so that future computerized
signatures can be verified against the shape and speed of the pen strokes,
pen pressure and number of times the pen leaves a writing surface.

--Face recognition systems such as the new version of TrueFace by Miros
Corp. of Wellesley, Mass. TrueFace recognizes an individual according to the
unique brow-to-nose tip triangle and already is used by Mr. Payroll
automatic paycheck-cashing machines in hundreds of service stations and
grocery stores in 20 states.

The latest version - TrueFaceNT - allows for standalone verification that
the user logging onto a laptop or personal computer loaded with Microsoft's
Windows NT software is authorized to use the computer or access the data it
contains.
Visionics of Jersey City, N.J., a Miros rival, used the Chicago show to
unveil its third-generation FaceIt system, which can scan one face against
12 million others per minute and is being incorporated into home-security
systems for sale in the United States.
Visionics' face-mapping system was speeded up in the wake of its "Mandrake"
experiment in London, in which the city put 144 face-scanning cameras in a
high-crime area in hopes of lessening neighborhood violence.
That experiment has raised privacy concerns, because laws in the United
Kingdom and Europe generally prohibit people who collect personal
information for one purpose from selling or using it for another reason.
U.S. law, however, holds that people's faces, voices or images of body parts
aren't private if they're collected publicly or voluntarily provided to a
bank, school or other user.
"When you give your biometric identifier to a private institution, what's
going to happen to it?" John Woodward, a lawyer, former CIA operations
officer and biometrics expert, recently asked Congress, stressing that it's
up to Congress to change privacy law.
But Congress has yet to protect the privacy of computerized medical,
financial and personnel files. Robert Ellis Smith, publisher of the Privacy
Journal, predicts that "it's going to be awhile" before Congress copes with
the privacy questions posed by biometrics and decides if data about your
face, hands and eyeballs can be bought, shared or sold.

As you can see from my new .signature, I have now installed BeOS on my
machine.  I am also typing this message on a Dvorak keyboard.  In the
last election, I voted Libertarian where possible.  I'm a
Singularitarian, and thus by extension a transhumanist, a
science-fiction fan, and a novelty-seeker.  Coincidence?  I think not. 
For some people, There Is A Better Way.

Let us consider:  Is someone running MacOS or Linux or BeOS, even though
95% of the planet uses Windows, more likely to use the Dvorak keyboard,
even though 95% of the planet uses QWERTY?  Is someone who votes
Libertarian more likely to be a transhumanist?  I have no hard
statistics on the subject, but I suspect that there is considerable
overlap between the groups.

I'd like to list the following items for a Better Way Award.  The Better
Way Awards are given to Ways (1) that inspire fanatic devotion in their

Hah,  I totally agree - as a young child my grandparents were a bit on the
senile side... instead of purchasing their new grandson a regular nursery
rhymes book,  I was given the Charles Addams' Mother Goose.  Needless to
say, my parents wouldn't read me Addams Family nursery rhymes... save for
when we'd visit the grandfolks - they'd insist upon it.

...and here I am. =)

Absolutely, I've been worried a long time about the insidious effects of
Disney on impressionable young minds.


And, I agree with you about Dr Seuss - wonderful.

The Swiss "social contract" differs very much from the U.S. "social contract".

In Switzerland, one have a rather rigid social context to adhere to, which
might give various U.S. citizens a feeling of claustrophobia after a while.

This creates a firmer social fabric than in the freedom oriented U.S.

Yes, it measures space-time curvature. If I remember my
MisnerThorneWheeler right, you can calculate the components of the
local metric tensor by having three orthogonal mass detectors (or
should there be more? there are ten independent components).

You can have curvature without any mass, gravitational waves are a
good example. But the equivalence principle essentially says that
acceleration is acceleration, regardless of the cause.

Right; you'd rather hire thugs, give them badges, and have them armed and
willing to kill for you... anything as long as it's not your responsibility.

Of course back in reality-land there's no reason why everyone should be 
armed; merely the fact that some small proportion of people are armed 
with concealed weapons causes a significant drop in crime rates.

Also I think there was a more in-depth article on the Economist

Typical anti-gunner nonsense. The reality is, there are very few legal guns
in Britain, and millions (police figures) of illegal guns. Very few people
get shot, but lots of people get their brains bashed out of their skulls
with blunt objects. Very few people got murdered a century ago, back when 
anyone with $2.50 to spare could get a license to carry a gun, and a 
gentleman's suit came with a 'pistol pocket' for precisely that reason; at
the time -- prior to the growth of organized crime and corrupt government
during Prohibition -- the American murder rate was roughly the same. And 
back then there were only a few dozen armed robberies with guns in London
each year, whereas today there are many thousands.

So yes, the number of shooting deaths has probably gone down since the
first anti-gun laws... but the number of murders has gone up, and the
number of armed crimes has gone up massively. This whole 'banning guns
reduces shooting deaths and we don't care about brains-beaten-out-of-the
-skull deaths' is typical anti-gun spin; I'm concerned about being killed,
I don't care whether I'm killed in the 'uncivilized' American fashion with
a bullet or the 'civilized' British fashion by having my brains bashed out
with a blunt object. Actually, thinking about it, I'd rather be shot.

Also worth noting is that there are a couple of states in America with 
similar murder rates to Britain despite -- or most likely because of -- comparatively lax gun laws; the US murder rate figures are massively
inflated because of shootouts between inner-city drug dealers. Since 
Britain doesn't have the same kind of 'War on Drugs' such shootouts are 
rare, though the cigarette smugglers have been shooting each other fairly
regularly in the last couple of years, including a couple of drive-bys;
with massive cigarette taxes in Britain and little or none some places on
the Continent, smuggling is a multi-billion-dollar industry today.

Interestingly, about eighteen months ago the British press was full of 
stories about 'getting guns off the streets' by banning legal handguns. 
As of a week or two ago after a TV presenter was shot dead on her doorstep, 
the press was full of stories bemoaning the ease with which criminals could
buy or rent illegal handguns for use in crimes. Uh guys, we told you that
back when you were pushing to ban them, I notice you didn't mention it
then...

>If the population of the UK was scaled up to match the population of the USA
>would we find that the levels of violence or crime in general would be
>similar despite our different systems of laws, 

No. Per-capita, many crime rates are much higher in Britain than America,
for example assaults are more than twice as common; see the DoJ report at
http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cjusew96.htm. 

But hey, you're less likely to be shot, just more likely to be beaten to
a pulp in the street by some drunken asshole... Gotta be a win.

Joe, AMERICA WAS FOUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO WOULD RATHER SHOOT DISARMERS THAN GIVE
UP THEIR GUNS! And since then, the freedom-lovers of the world have been
leaving Europe and Asia and moving to America; the country probably has
the largest population of freedom-loving people in the world, many of whom
have previously lived in totalitarian societies which have disarmed them
in order to control them, and now you want to take away their guns. What 
you think they're going to do?

In safe, civilized gun-free Britain, they go to jail; there was a shopowner
in Liverpool three or four years ago who got fed up with being robbed at
gunpoint by crooks with illegal handguns so he spent $60 on an illegal
handgun of his own and the next time an armed robber turned up the 
shopowner shot him dead. Rather than praising him for helping to reduce
the crime rate, the cops charged him with numerous serious crimes and he
went to jail for years.

Such a civilized country now they've banned guns, ain't it?

Just like the typical anti-gunner, I ask a direct question, you ignore it.
Where in the 2nd Amendment does it say that the Federal government can 
ban gun possession (or nuclear weapons possession, for that matter) by 
any of these groups?

Answer: it doesn't. The Federal government cannot legally pass any law
restricting possession of weapons of any kind. State governments could, 
at least prior to the 14th Amendment, since when it's been a more open
question.

Whether or not I want them to have guns is irrelevant; the Federal 
government has no legal power to prevent them. None. State governments may
or may not, but they're currently relaxing gun laws while the Feds are
strengthening theirs. Odd that, isn't it?

>Then yours would definitely be taken away,

See Joe, just like the typical anti-gunner you start off saying you'll only
ban gun ownership for criminals and children, and then we discover that
opposing your laws will also be taken as grounds for being disarmed. What
was that about our silly "slippery slope" argument?

>because you 
>are clearly one deranged fuckwad!

Well, as they say, it takes one to know one, eh Joe? BTW, I don't own any
guns; while I'm seriously thinking of leaving soon -- partly because I'm 
fed up with the violence here -- I'm probably in the Benighted Kingdom 
for another year or two, and the slippery slope of disarmament is almost
complete over here, from "we have to register guns to reduce crime rates"
(actually so they could confiscate guns from commies come a revolution, 
but that wasn't publically acknowledged 'til decades later) to banning 
almost everything. 

That said, I'm about to pick up an air assault rifle and probably a couple 
of other airguns before they ban them too; I have to admit, I find creeping
through woods shooting at people with a fully-automatic air rifle a lot more 
fun than shooting paper targets with a bolt-action .30 caliber. Shame they're
not much good for self-defence.

Huh, what? You think the Feds will suddenly slap their foreheads, say "Oh
damn, we forgot the 2nd Amendment, we'd better repeal all those gun laws"
and that will be that? They're ignoring it, just as they have been for
decades now, and they will continue to do so.

Indeed. That's why we want to give people the tools they need to defend
themselves against violent criminals. Try living in a disarmed country for
a while, Joe, and you'll understand why gun ownership is so important.

Now you're just being facetious, my argument is that times change and
society and its systems need to change also, in order that previously
unforseen situations can be dealt with, appropriate legislation drawn up /
debated as the need arises, and outdated (meaning no longer relevant or
appropriate) legislation must be seen as such and must be allowed to be
adapted (or discarded) as the need arises.

Note to the clueless: pro-gunners say we need guns to *prevent* crimes by
stopping criminals when they try to commit those crimes. Anti-gunners prefer
to punish the criminals *after* the crime is committed, if they get caught;
if the victim was killed, raped, etc, well, tough luck.

No, we'd rather prevent such shootings by having people with guns there to
shoot anyone who tries it. As has happened on at least one occasion in
America and several occasions in Israel, but the anti-gunners don't like 
to mention that.

>than to adopt reasonable and rational measures 
>designed to prevent the guns from getting into their hands

Joe, these kids had bombs. Big fucking bombs. Bombs reportedly big enough
to blow up half the school if they'd been set off. Had they had no guns,
then they would have set those bombs off, and far more kids would have
died.

Bombs, incidentally, have been illegal for quite a while, as far as I'm
aware. So much for laws, eh?

Where do you live Craig? I hope it's not London, because there were a couple
of front-page stories in the newspapers last week about how the Metropolitan
Police "didn't have a hope in hell"[1] of fixing the Y2K bugs in their
systems before the end of the year. What do you think the crooks are going
to do if the cops are out of action and the population have voluntarily
disarmed themselves? Oh, I bet they'll all just sit at home watching the

I'm not sure they are the most important influence in most children,
but they can be. Many factors add together in creating a person, and
often they affect different aspects.

I read a lot of popular science books when I was a kid, and then moved
on the science fiction. It was at least a partial cause for me
becoming a transhumanist, but the reason I started with science is at
present unclear to me. But once I was immersed in the world of
science/science fiction, transhumanism slowly emerged as a logical
conclusion to me.

I wonder if children shouldn't be introduced to Stanislaw Lem's _The
Cyberiad_ at an early age. Many of the stories can likely be
translated into a simpler language (even if they often are readable as
they are in the translations I read), and put transhumanistish ideas
into the heads of children. Beside the humor and nonsense, he deals
with how to solve problems with intelligence (such as the hillarious
story about making the perfect monster), the philosophical
consequences of robots, uploading, copying and a lot of other stuff,
trains recursive thinking and overall plays with your mind. 

Of course, in my case the main influence on early scientific thinking
may have been the character Skalman in the swedish cartoon Bamse. He
was an eccentric turtle who built strange inventions, read books,
slept (he had a clock which told him when it was time to sleep, eat
and read - usually at the most inconvenient time) and generally helped
the main character Bamse (a bear who became super-strong by eating a
certain kind of honey) by intelligent advice (often 100% correct
popular science). Unfortunately the Skalman character remained rather
peripheral, and the rest of the cartoon developed in a rather naive
leftist/PC direction. 

We need more transhumanists to write childrens books! And cartoons!

Oh, and before Joe accuses me of being a dangerous nut again, I'm talking
about the Japanese equivalent of paintball, with two teams fighting each
other with air assault rifles, SMGs, shotguns, grenade launchers, etc,
firing small plastic pellets rather than paint, which is currently 
growing rapidly in the UK too. Somehow I think the government's attempt 
to "destroy the gun culture" is backfiring, as those of us who used to 
shoot gunpowder guns are discovering that airguns are almost totally
unrestricted and firefights with other people are a lot more fun than 
shooting paper.

Shame I can't spare $5000 for that cute air minigun...

I think we need more in the media in general; I'm working my way up the 
British film industry at the moment (the only reason I'm here), and 
trying to come up with a good low-budget feature film with transhumanist
leanings to shoot next year. Unfortunately the only good idea I've had

What about something like Greg Egan's less cosmic stories? I think
"Axiomatic", "The Walk", "The Moral Virologist" or something like it
could make a great low-budget movie (even if it could be tricky to get
the point across).

Main problem is that I'd have to buy the rights to adapt the story, which
I almost certainly can't afford... lately I've been reading a lot of old
copyright-expired stories to see if there's something I could adapt to a
futuristic setting.

I agree that your plan should be easy to operate, yet still have a positive
impact. Go for it.

Or maybe there would be a chance Egan would let you have the
rights for free or cheap if you could show him something
spectacular to convince him you'd do a good job with it?

I'm currently trying to teach myself Maya and some other
packages, so maybe in the somewhat near-future it would be
possible to do a 3D feature. What I find really lacking is
an all-in-one motion capture rig that could really allow
for virtual acting. Right now you can capture either body
movements or facial movements, but not both at the same
time along with audio... and the facial capture I've seen
hasn't been as detailed as I would like (i.e. no eye movement
capture) in order to make closeups lifelike looking. So it
seems most of the animation still requires a bunch of slow
hand tweaking and it still doesn't look quite right.

I was a Tom Swift addict, and also another series with a character
called "Brains Benton". There was another series featuring a father
and his two sons, (one son named Randy) that covered things like
rocketry and the basics of atomic energy, very cool!

Let's not forget Johnny Quest.....

Yes, I'm aware that Dvorak faked the tests.  Dvorak is still a better
keyboard.  Type in Dvorak and you rapidly realize that typing has a
rhythm, a rhythm that QWERTY was specifically designed to break up.

I didn't think to measure my speed, I'm afraid.

The police have a vested interest in exaggerating the problem of illegal
firearms, just as they have an interest in exaggerating the value of
seized drug hauls. Last figures I heard suggested 250,000 illegal guns
at most, and probably a lot less, in the UK.

Please quantify. IIRC, the murder rate per capita in the UK is about a
tenth of the murder rate in the USA, although for lesser crimes the
rates are generally similar.

If widespread gun ownership deters crime, then one would expect the USA
to be a crime-free zone compared to the UK -- or expect the UK to have
much higher crime levels than Switzerland.

Note that I am _not_ trying to make a case for banning guns; I deplore the
UK's gun control regime. However, I believe that the issues surrounding
violence in American society are orthogonal to the widespread ownership of
guns; there are cultural influences at work here that bear investigation.

Not paranoid in the slightest, pragmatic. I have the right to

If you do not wish to own a gun and be responsible for your own
protection, that is your choice, but you do not have the right to
make that choice for me.

Alarms rarely stop anything but the simplest burglars, sniping the
phone line (easily accessible) renders most useless.

The police? Fine if that's what you want, and they happen to be
available, of course they're not responsible if anything happens to
you.

The second amendment was written long after the earth cooled, and
most of the 20,000 gun laws in this country violate the second
amendment. If your so determined, as we have pointed out you should
start by repealing the second amendment.

In all the recent incidences, numerous gun laws were broken,
passing more won't stop them.

It's interesting that the anti-gunners keep ignoring the fact that
in both the most recent serious shootings, the perps were on
prescription mind altering drugs.

The connection between the shooters and Ritalin is a curious coincidence.
Like amphetamines and other similar stimulants, Ritalin can cause
psychosis, mental instability, and other similar problems in some people.

Given the heavy usage of Ritalin for kids these days, I would not find it
surprising that it is inducing dangerous mental states in some people.
This could very possibly account for the increase in violence among kids in
recent years.  I think it would behoove the public to explore this angle a
little bit further.

To continue on the subject of FACTS (remember those?)  Prof. John Lott's
work on the gun issue has been offered by the pro gun side as "the"
definitive work on the subject.  

Can any anti-gunners offer any comparable, scientifically rigorous work to
refute the evidence presented by the other side?

Remember everyone, hard, cold facts don't go away just because you dont want
to believe them.

Indeed; looking at the historical data Britain and America both had similar
murder rates when both had similar gun laws, since then Britain's murder
rate has gone up and down, while America's grew dramatically at the
beginning of Prohibition, dropped about 50% with the end of Prohibition,
and grew again with the War On Some Drugs.

Pardon my ignorance, my first exposure to localizers was in Vinge's
_Deepness in the Sky_. Recently Bruce Sterling (via his Viridian Green
list, not terribly extropic) posted a speech he made at SIGCHI 99 about
future household localizers. Here's an excerpt:

8<----------------------
This idea is probably best filed under the grand
conceptual heading of "tangible cyberspace," i.e., the
process in which the products, programs, and innate nature
of virtuality spill out of the computer screen and infect
the physical world.

     People used to talk about "wiring the home."  This is
old-fashioned rhetoric now. Turn the term inside out, and
it becomes "sheltering your network." It all becomes clear
if you postulate that the net always comes first.  My
physical possessions are an aspect of the net.

     Today, right now, if you objectively compare my
virtual possessions to my actual possessions, it rapidly
becomes obvious that my actual possessions are violently
out of control.  I have all kinds of searching and
cataloging devices and services for my desktop machine,
and for the Internet.  But I've been known to hunt for my
socks or my car keys for almost an hour.

     My house is an awful mess, because my actual
possessions are very stupid.  They don't know what they
are, they don't know where they are, and they don't know
where they belong.

     All this could change with a small, cheap, network
peripheral which is, I believe, just barely over the
technical horizon. The device I imagine is very similar to
a common antitheft device, but much smarter.  We could
call it a "tab," or a "localizer," or a "locator ID tag."

    I imagine this locator ID tag having about a hundred k
of memory and costing about ten cents.   It probably runs
on household temperature fluctuations.   Its primary
activity is to emit a unique radio chirp every two seconds
or so.  This chirp is triangulated by a network of
receivers in my house and my lawn.  Basically, the chip
says, "I'm what I am, and here's where I am," in other
words, "I am Bruce Sterling's left cowboy boot, and here I
am under the couch where the cat dragged me."

     Fine, you think:  you're tagging everything you own,
how anal and geeky of you.  No, that's not how this works.
I'm way too lazy to work that hard.  Instead, I pay a
professional interior designer to come in and tag
everything for me.  I pay this guy (most likely she's a
very smart woman actually), to catalog and tag everything
I own, and put it where it sensibly belongs == and record
that data, and embed it in my system for me.

    Now I know nothing, but  my house knows where all my
stuff is.  My possessions know what they are, and where
they belong.  Unskilled labor can enter my home, and
restore everything to perfect order in maybe an hour.

     And of course no one can steal any of it, because
it's all security tagged, automatically.
---------------------->8

Searching the web produced no useful hits on localizers. I would
appreciate any references. I'm also interested in the intersection of
localizer tech, nanofog, and, (as per _Deepness_), the idea of
ubiquitous law enforcement, where (paraphrase) 'every object becomes a
governing device'.

Thanks,
    -Mike

Not really; gun ownership doesn't deter crime if people can't carry those
guns with them. Crooks may decide not to break into people's houses 
because they might be armed, but that's not really a problem since they
can just wait until their victims are out on the streets and disarmed by 
law.

According to that DoJ report I posted a URL for, in some areas (assault 
and property crimes) it has much higher crime levels than America; this 
is probably one reason why the anti-gunners stick to murder rates. It's
possible the DoJ are fudging the figures to make America look better, but 
they appear to have gone to some trouble to get accurate statistics by
looking both at official police reports and victim surveys... and they
would seem to have a vested interest in making it look worse to get more
funding.

You can describe many of these arrangements in terms of private property,
where the property is abstract.  We had a debate about this recently
in which some people disagreed with the legitimacy of such forms of
abstract property, and argued that "broadcast rights", for example,
were a taking of their right to emit EM radiation on their own property
using their own equipment.

Another questionable example is air pollution rights.  This is something
that Los Angeles has experimented with.  Polluters can trade the rights
to emit a certain amount of pollution per year.  This is efficient in
terms of allocating resources, given that the desired level of pollution
is set.  But not every person in Los Angeles was consulted about the
total amount of pollution rights in existence.  Some people may feel
that this pseudo private property arrangement is actually a coercive
tort against their health.  Because clean air is a public good, they
cannot effectivelly take part in the pollution market.  So here we have
the trappings of a private property solution, but one which by some
standards imposes coercion on third parties.

The point is that private property is a matter of social definition.
Society decides what things to treat as private property based on
utilitarian grounds.  As we move away from strict ownership of individual
objects as property, we gain increasing flexibility to solve problems.
But people will differ about when we have crossed a line and moved away
from a free market approach.

You seem to be using a very limited definition of monetary value (to echo
your comment above).  This list does have value to its participants,
and presumably we would be willing to pay for access to this form of
entertainment if it were not free.

In a sense your reasoning is circular.  We don't pay anything for the
opportunity to participate in this discussion, because it is free.  It is
free because we aren't using property rights to allocate the resources
in question.  But because it is (monetarily) free, you say it has no
monetary value.  By this reasoning any activity which is organized
outside of property rights will have no monetary value.  Hence any
non-property-rights activity is excluded from economic consideration
by definition.  The result is that property rights are the only way to
organize economic activity.

In fact, I believe that not only does this list have economic significance
and value, but that in the future this kind of free sharing of information
will be increasingly important and common.  Entertainment is going to be
an ever growing part of the economy.  Already the music, tv, and movie
business is huge.  Online sharing of information, both discussions like
this and sharing of music and other entertainment, is where people are
going to be spending their leisure resources in the future.

How can you say that we allocate no resources here?  We spend hours
reading this list, engaging in discussion, doing research, composing
responses.  This requires the most fundamental resource of all, our time,
attention, and energy.  We make the decision to spend our time doing
this rather than other leisure activities because it brings us value.
Because the resource allocation is voluntary and mutual is no reason to
disregard it.

I disagree with where you are drawing the line between private property
and collectivism.  You are assuming that only under private property do
people make their own decisions about how to do things.  I would say
instead that this is a characteristic of a voluntary system, one in
which people participate without coercion.

I think we can agree that voluntarism is the central feature by which a
system should be ethically judged.  If people are compelled to participate
under threat of punishment, this is not acceptable.  Everyone involved
should participate freely and voluntarily.  This does not imply that
they are using private property to manage their resources.

The distinction I draw between private property and other systems
is whether the resources in question are owned by individuals, and
whether some kind of payment is associated with exchanging resources.
The payment may be in the form of a barter system, where two people
agree on an exchange of property they value; it may be in the form of
a monetary system, where there is some general-purpose commodity which
they will accept in exchange for giving up their property; it may be in
the form of an accounting system, where records keep track of how much
each person has owing to them.

In a cooperative or collective system, these features are absent.
People contribute without expecting immediate or propertional recompense.
Of course, over time, they must expect to get more out of the system
than they give, otherwise they would not participate.  But there is no
quid pro quo, nobody keeping track or keeping score of how much is owed
to/by each person.

This is exactly the kind of system we use here to manage the time and
resources we contribute to our discussion.  Nobody is getting paid or
paying.  But we each feel that what we get out of the conversation is
worth what we put into it.

It's hard to answer these questions with any degree of specificity.  Any
community will evolve their own answers.  Do you agree that voluntary
communities exist which do have answers to these questions?  Do you agree
that such communities include corporations, extended families, communes,
kibbutzim, and other examples?

> Until you address these issues, we don't have a concrete enough proposal to
> examine in any realistic fashion.

On the contrary, we are surrounded with such communities!  There is a
whole economics literature on the theory of the firm, which examines
whether and when a market/property system is more efficient than a
voluntary cooperative system for allocating internal resources.

The existence of corporations is something of a challenge to traditional
economics.  If a property/market system is so good, why is it not used
within companies, large and small?  (Some do use it; garage mechanics
often own their own tools, and some businesses use independent contractors
rather than employees.)  There is a great deal of literature looking
into the tradeoffs which exist.

If you work for a company, you can answer your five questions yourself.
Just consider how things are organized within the business where you work.

I don't really know if democracy by computer could work.  Some people
might want to try it.  The recent novel EarthWeb by Marc Stiegler showed
another model for decision making, based on Idea Futures.  I expect that
we will see many experiments along these lines.

This may be correct.  As you say later, the biggest problem is getting
access to people's preferences.  This is not only a problem of data
volume, but also of incentive compatibility - whether people will
be honest.

So, what do we disagree about?  Is it purely a matter of definitions?
Do you call "private property" any voluntary arrangement, even the most
leftist, anti-capitalist, Marxist commune you can imagine?  In my view
that stretches the phrase beyond reasonable boundaries.

Beyond definitions, I think there is still ground to discuss the degree
to which voluntary but not property based interactions will be used in the
future.  The main question in my mind is, will this occur to a greater
extent than now?  Or, perhaps, will the opposite occur, with computers
reducing the costs of establishing markets in areas where they are not
practical now?

I have been surprised and impressed by the growth of the net, this
incredible voluntary community.  People put tremendous resources into
their online activities, making web pages, engaging in discussions,
sharing resources.  And all this is done without payment in other than
intangibles like reputation.

This is starting to change, perhaps; more and more I run into sites begging
me to click on their banners to bring them a few cents.  Will this become
the norm?  With HTML email will we start to see signatures with hot links
that will offer payment to the poster?  It will be very interesting to see
how it works out.

> What some of us consider "evil" is when some outside agency gains the power
> to dictate to individuals how they must handle their affairs.

I don't think it is so simple.  If the individuals in question voluntarily
agreed to the arrangement (as when I agree to allow my boss to dictate
how I must handle my work affairs), then it is not evil.  If I join a
commune and agree to allow the community to dictate how I must handle

I may have misunderstood your point, when you originally wrote:

So you meant that Russia under communism recently demonstrated that
an economy without markets has its hands full just keeping people fed.
I'm not sure this is the case, although I don't know exactly what time
frame you had in mind (the 1980s?).  I have mostly heard of Russia having
problems with food within the last couple of years.

It's always good to check both sides of an issue.  I went to Handgun
Control's web site, www.handguncontrol.org, and typed Lott in the search
box.  Here are the first two hits:

http://www.handguncontrol.org/gunowner/statflaw.htm

   Since its publication, researchers across the country have reviewed
   the Lott Study and reanalyzed Lott's data, and found its conclusions
   unsubstantiated. These researchers include Jens Ludwig at Georgetown
   University; Daniel Black of the University of Kentucky and Daniel Nagin
   at Carnegie Mellon University; Stephen Teret, Jon Vernick and Daniel
   Webster, all of Johns Hopkins University; Arthur Kellermann at Emory
   University; and Douglas Weil at the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence.

http://www.handguncontrol.org/concealed.htm

   This study conducted by the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence has
   concluded that Dr. Lott and the gun lobby have got it all wrong:
   allowing people to carry concealed handguns does not mean less crime.

Presumably people interested in this issue will want to follow up and
compare these studies with Lott's, to derive their own conclusions.

Just checked whether the File Open Failed error was related to my computer
or SETI@Home's computers, by attempting to connect about once a second for a
couple of minutes.  And eventually the program DID connect, and didn't
display 'File open failed'.  So it is most likely simply a server overload
error.  Just wait for a while and try again if you get it.

Kellermann should know an unsubstantiated gun violence study when he sees 
one, having produced one of the worst such studies himself...

As Brian pointed out, Egan might be reasonable. Besides, you don't
need to use any of his stories, just something in that style. What I
like about the stories above is that they have no obvious special
effects, are set in a near future but still raise important
questions. Especially _The Walk_ shows how it could be done, even if
the story is maybe too minimalistic to work as a movie on its own. But
imagine something more extended based on the same idea (the
possibility of modifying one's beliefs - or other's beliefs - at
will); perhaps a mystery story or family drama, where the
transhumanist stuff creep in slowly and unnoticeably but eventually
become the main philosophical point.

	Hi.. anyone else getting the error 'File open failed' when trying to send
in a result from the Windows version of SETI@home?.. I've gotten this error
both on my machine at work and at home (one of which is 98, and one of
which is NT 4.0), so it seems to be a real bug and not just my
configuration.. this error is most annoying, since it actually causes the
program to exit, and will almost certainly keep my machine at work from
running SETI@home all weekend like I usually do..

BTW, on the Extropy.org and Transhumanism.com team, my nick is 'Auriam', in
case it seemed mysterious ;).

Murder rates are higher in those US states which have a concealed

Murder is the irreversible crime; it is the one which forever revokes 
one's right to life, liberty, property and pursuit of happiness, as well

Pro-gunners play the intellectually dishonest DEA medical

claiming that there's no evidence to justify them when they fight 
tooth and nail to prevent the experiment from going forward so that 
such evidence can be gathered.

So, pass the laws provisionally and let the cold, hard facts be 
gathered, whydoncha, instead of stupidly, and with no evidence of 
your own, maintaining that it is better for the underage, abusive, 
retarded, criminally violent and insane to be armed than not.

The perps also were gun-toters on prescription mind-altering drugs. 
People like that should be forbidden to possess guns if a

Have you ever noticed that in the book Cinderella the cat was named Lucifer?
I first saw this in a Golden book series and then payed closer attention to
the Disney movie, (of course not any new version) and caught it there also.

I hooked up with the SETI at home program last night. It warns that you may
get an error, and says to choose another mirror if this happens. Lucky for
me, mine is working just fine. I blelieve there are some pages you can dig
around for on their site that will help you with any problems you may have
with downloading the software.

True (though criminals in the UK are increasingly arming themselves), but 
not particularly useful, since Britain has one of the lowest murder rates 
in the world and hasn't changed greatly for a century or so; I think it's 
about 50% higher today than when Britons could carry concealed at will. 
Several of those states have murder rates comparable to Continental 
European countries, which also generally have very strict gun laws 
compared to America. Remove the drug-dealing-related inner city murders 
and the entire country isn't much worse than Europe.

But anyway, why is it that those states -- with more guns and less 
restrictions -- are seeing reductions in violent crime while Britain 
-- with fewer guns and more restrictions -- is becoming increasingly 
violent?

Personally I'd happily trade a slightly larger chance of being murdered 
for being armed and a greatly reduced chance of being attacked at random 
by drunken idiots.

reasonable people wanna keep 'em outta the hands of those 
statistically most likely to misuse them (violent criminals, the 
mentally deficient and/or deranged, spouse and/or child abusers, 
children).  This is a proactive rather than reactive stance.  Your 
armed guard certainly didn't work as NRA advertized in Littleton.

And your armed guard didn't work in Littleton, but you don't like to

It takes no technique to pull a trigger (though some to aim 
properly), but a good amount to obtain the necessary materials and 
to properly construct and detonate a bomb.  I'd just as soon make 
them do it the hard way and have many more of them fail, 
thankyouverymuch!  At least make it as hard for them to get the 
guns as it is to get the bombmaking materials; guns are relatively 
hard to make, so if they can't get readymade ones, they're stuck.

Bad news, Brian.  Second Amendment was written during a time when people
carried flint-lock muzzle-loaders, when they were concerned with British
troops crashing down the front door, when armed combat was an honorable
affair.  Unfortunately, the Second Amendment is one of the only Amendments
to the Constitution that has not properly stood the tests of time.  It is
reasonable for a person to keep a gun in their home, but realize that there
has been a surge of lawsuits involving would-be burglars suing home-owners
for damage inflicted upon them by firearms and knives.  There are now legal
precedents making it difficult for home-owners to maintain their right to
use their guns in the privacy of their own home.  

The important thing to remember is that gun safety and gun control are
important; people should educate their children to respect and understand
guns, and efforts should be made to make it difficult to own a gun.  I
personally have no problem with people owning firearms, keeping them in
their homes.  But as soon as you hit the streets packing heat, you're a
potential threat to everyone around you.  The NRA's spokesmen and their
red-in-the-face, pry-it-from-my-cold-dead-fingers attitude is frightening,
fascist, and indicative of barbarism.  Personal security aside, you just
want to feel big and powerful.

Sure. I have various instances running on:

In the context of seti@home? Why should it be?
Typically, on a Unix box you have setiathome running in the background
with its niceness set to the maximum (20), so it will only gobble spare
CPU cyles no other process wants. If the machine is otherwise idle,
that's easily 99%. The Unix version could only be faster than the NT
one, if NT kept drawing large amounts of cycles for other purposes. I
don't know NT, but it can't be that broken, can it?

Straw-man time; I have advocated denying gun ownership to (once 
again, and am prepared to say 1000 times more) violent criminals, 
the mentally deficient and/or deranged, spouse and/or child 
abusers, and children.  Do you see "citizen business owner" 
anywhere in the above list?  Then why pretend that it's there, hunh?

New Zealand also has very high levels of gun ownership per capita, although
almost all the gunsa are long barrelled.  Partially it comes from rural
owners owning a large number of guns, ownership levels in urbvan areas are
quite low.

And when exactly have any of us ever said that we'd use a gun as our first
defence against any threat? Only a fool resorts to violence if they don't 
have to.

    Mark

But guns imply violence, don't they?  "The willingness and ability to
protect myself" is good diplomacy, but when someone sees or knows that you
are carrying a firearm, they know that you represent a physical threat.  All
ability to compromise on a normal level is forfeit.  My stepfather always
told me, "If you pull a gun on someone, you better be ready to shoot them,
because otherwise, when they come down from being scared and pissing in
their pants, they're gonna get really pissed and want to kill you."  It
applies here as well.  If there is no problem, why introduce new variables
that could cause new ones.  If you don't have to resort to violence, then
there is no need to have a gun there in the first place.

A common misconception.  At the time, private citizens owned full-
scale warships with cannons, and many wealthy estates had armories
full of guns and bombs a Montana survivalist would envy.  The idea
that a government-run army should be the only one to have such
things was precisely the sort of tyranny we fought against.

Yet property crime is higher in the UK, as ar assaults. Not to mention that demographically,
the US is far far different from the UK. I'll bet if you compare states with similar
demographics to the UK you'll see much more closer comparison.

Thats right, but killing a criminal is not murder, and I'd much rather it were him and not me,
and I'd much rather trust my protection to myself than to.... well since the government is not
liable for protecting me, then I have no-one to trust but myself.

Here's a question: What do the gun controllers propose to give me in services in exchange for
my guns? Will they provide bodyguards? NO? Will they lock up anyone who ever exhibited a hint
of deviancy? NO? Will they pay for the prisons they will need to enforce the fascist state
they want to impose? NO? Well, then, no deal.

definition of fascism:
from Encyclopedia.com:

"philosophy of government that glorifies the nation-state at the expense
of the individual...  Fascism generally gains support by promising social
justice to discontented elements of the working and middle classes, and
social order to powerful financial interests."

Start enforcing the laws we already have before you come to me to ask that I give up more
freedoms...

Wrongo. Many of the signors of the Decl. of Ind. owned their own cannon. Armed
combat and even duelling was an honorable affair, but the fact they are not now
says volumes to the degeneracy of the value of honor in society than to the
currency of the concept of self defense.

The only precedents which have withstood court tests are those where a homeowner
shot a criminal in the back as they were leaving the domicile. And those were in
states that don't respect much of the Constitution anymore anyways.

One warning: Don't ever accuse me of fascism. The definition of fascism is as
follows:
from Encyclopedia.com:

"philosophy of government that glorifies the nation-state at the expense
of the individual...  Fascism generally gains support by promising social
justice to discontented elements of the working and middle classes, and
social order to powerful financial interests."

This describes the gun controllers FAR more than anyone who has ever promoted
gun rights.

I will repeat what I have said before: Gun owners are demonstrated to be far
more peaceful, non-confrontational, and less likely to commit violent crimes
than non-gun owners. That is far more civilized than the spasms of street
violence and government opression we have seen from the likes of gun
controllers.

A common misconception.  At the time, private citizens owned full-
scale warships with cannons, and many wealthy estates had armories
full of guns and bombs a Montana survivalist would envy.  The idea
that a government-run army should be the only one to have such
things was precisely the sort of tyranny we fought against. 


Now I say:
Also at the time, the army was made up of the entire supporting populace.
So it wasn't incredible for a wealthy 'private citizen' to own his own
warships, it was actually seen as an advantage, and he was usually made a
General.  Also, if a Montana survivalist starts grabbing at mortar from the
18th century and flint-locks, then they are obviously delusional.  So the
problem here isn't how much they had, but what they were packing.  There's a
difference between a muzzle-loader that takes 25 seconds to reload and an
UZI with an extended clip and a grenade launcher strapped to your back.

Now that we have you set in stone, please further define what each category means.
1) Are violent criminals: a) murderers b) rapists c) muggers, or are they: d) been
in a car accident, e) spanked their children in public f) a woman who slapped a man
for a rude comment.
2) What minimum IQ do you need to no be considered mentally dificient? Do we go by
the Soviet mental health system, where anyone who disagrees with the politically
correct party line is obviously mentally deranged (as things seem to rapidly be
moving here anyways)?
3) What is the standard of action and evidence for spousal and child abuse? What is
the burden of proof and due process?
4) So when the AARP lobbies to raise the age of majority to 35, they you agree that
everyone younger must give up their guns?

Rather than pushing these standards as laws that can obviously be manipulated and
changed at the whim of the current media/PR pressure, will you push these as a
proposed Constitutional Amendment as they should be?

If not, then your standards are illegal and unconstitutional.

No.  I've been deleting everything.  I think that at this point we
should Ban the following topics, except for brief announcements of bad laws.

1.  Guns.
2.  Politics.

Extropianism is about ultratechnology, whether the Principles say so or
not - just as science fiction is about advanced technology.  We need to
crack down decisively on those topics that aren't about technology at all.

No, a person who shouldn't have a gun gets quickly dead. A free man is not
free
unless armed.

Mike Lorrey

Wrong as well.  A person without a gun is free in a society where no one
else has guns, nor the will to do harm to others.  We're looking for a
Utopian Ideal here, right?  If a man has a gun and intends to be free, he
will only be free by himself, as he has singular power.  In order for
coexistence - and ultimately Utopia - to be reached, we must be free
together.  Freedom is the ability to walk down the street and, not only be
able to not worry about getting shot, but not worry about having to shoot
someone else.

Sorry, different definition of Fascist, or at least a different
understanding.  Someone who seeks to gain power over others with brute
force.  I could change my definition to include ultra-nationalists, but then
I wouldn't be able to use it so much ;)

I've already posted concerning 18th century warfare, and I do believe it's
sad that combat has lost its gentlemanly qualities, if you can say that with
a straight face.

I'm actually curious as to where you get your information.  If someone has
the ability to use violent force, they are going to be less violent?  I
don't see how this is logical.  The spasms of street violence we're caused
by non-gun owners?  It seems as though they would have to own guns first...
Gun controllers was also misunderstood.  What I intended from that statement
was that we should practice conscientious control, so that some day there
are no more guns. My cynical nature tells me this is impossible, so I think
I'll drop out of this argument now, and will just read the posts and hope
for enlightenment.  But please send all those statistics about non-violent
gun-owners through...

Wouldn't this require us to debate what constitutes a "bad law"?  <g>

Some of us prefer reality to Utopia.  It is idle fantasy to
imagine that (1) technology can move backwards, and guns will
vanish, (2) violent predators won't exist with or without guns,
or (3) that police are capable of protecting us.  If you can
show some reasonably possible way to achieve any of these
ends, perhaps then private gun ownership won't be necessary.

Actually there is a fourth option that might merit discussion
on this list: non-lethal protective technologies.  There are
a few promising technologies on the horizon, but nothing very
effective yet.  Perhaps a bit more brainstorming would help.

Life without politics isn't possible.  Politics will dictate which
technologies will be deveoped and what we will be able to do with them.
Those who abdicate their responsibility to engage in politics will
find themselves at the mercy of those who do not.  Fortunately, some
of us are on the side of the future.

Joe, you're hurting your credibility.  Several posters, including
myself, have raised the question of what standards of proof and due
process your concept would require.  You resort to profanity and
crass insults but don't answer the concerns based on historically
documented abuse of gun registration laws to disarm minorities
(sometimes as a prelude to genocide or "ethnic cleansing").

The biggest loophole in your proposal is "Mentally deficient or
deranged".  It is a documented fact that allowing bureaucracies to
determine who is deficient or deranged can be abused, (viz. Germany
1936), and you wrote,

  "To support my point I state this:  The guy I was just referring
   to who stated he would rather kill a police officer (who most
   likely has a wife and family) or other law enforcement officers
   than have his gun taken away SHOULD have his license revoked
   for saying that and have his weapons taken away as he is
   talking like a potential killer and is clearly a threat to
   the general public from my perspective."

Here we see an example of the slippery slope- you claim that this
person is deranged *only* due to his political views.  Of the groups
on your list below, only _convicted_ violent criminals and children
may be unequivocally denied the right to keep and bear arms- the
others would be an open door to political oppression and tyranny.

You want to disarm the man described above simply because he *does
not want to be disarmed*, and is willing to fight such oppression. 
Now do you see why some of us question your motives and goals?  Your
thinking is a catch-22... you seem to be saying that as long as a
person doesn't mind being forcibly disarmed, he may (might?) keep
those arms.

You feel that people are misquoting and misrepresenting you.  I
quote you verbatim, then point out your logical inconsistency.  Can
we discuss this without inflammatory words and rhetoric?

Fine, but a mailing list without political discussion is. I, for one, am on
this list for the optimistic techo-futurism orientation. Not for 20th
century political debates.

Implications vs violence...

A potential threat, yes.  A menace, probably not.  I was in a
restaurant with friends, waiting to be seated, when four tough young
men pushed their way ahead of us.  Keith mildly said, "It's
customary to give your name to the hostess and wait to be seated,"
whereupon the bravos clenched fists & teeth as their leader snarled,
"What are you gonna do about it?!"  Keith's son and I backed him up,
then his wife placed her hands on her belt by her (open carry) 9mm
pistol and sweetly said, "We're just asking you to show good
manners."

The bluff and bluster went away, as did the four belligerent young
men.

The presence of the gun made resorting to violence unnecessary.  It
could have gotten very ugly had Pattie not been armed.  Armed
citizens deter far more crime than they commit.

At least make it harder for him.  As for the person who is NOT a 
violent criminal, mentally defivcient and/or deranged, a spouse 
and/or child abuser, or a child, I have no problem with them having 
guns.  I DO have a problem with morons arguing against a position 
I did not take.

I think the importance of politics in a world of individua of all 
complexity, expanding outwards hard on the heels of the light cone 
will be less important than today. Both because they are not
monodisperse, and because of communication lag. Perhaps ecology 
and evolutionary biology will be more applicable.

I don't have a definite position towards guns. It's just that guns are 
relatively low-tech (is there legislation against possession of ABC
weapons by individuals?), yet never fail to provoke heated debates which 
never came to any consensus. Being fruitless, they'd be better kept
off-list.

Will there be politics after the Singularity?

Then you work with me to convince the rampant dorks here that 
violent criminals, the mentally deficient and/or deranged, spouse 
and/or child abusers and children should be forbidden by law to 
purcase, own or possess guns, and that anything that's ammo is 
called "ordnance" (the big stuff) should be classified not as arms, 
but as military hardware and kept exclusive to the military.  BTW, 
the bombs did not, for the most part, go off, and if the Littleton 
killers hadn't had the benefit of guns to keep people at bay while 
they attempted to detonate same, even less would have.

Getting sentimentally reminiscent on me?  It won't happen here, 
because our government is built to prevent it (at least since 
Roosevelt).  If we can kick Dick Nixon out, no one can stay beyond 
eight years, and the US is like a battleship; it turns slowly, so no 
one could throw the populace in camps before the honcho had to 
leave (besides, who would guard us all?).  There's something called 
balance of powers here, too, involving an independent congress and 
Judiciary, I believe...

You mean that a man who is not free to kill many others at a 
distance and a moment's notice isn't free?  How free is your armed 
man if a nut, child or criminal who shouldn't even have a gun shoots 
him in the back of the head?

While I agree that the US government is built to avoid things like Weimar and 
Nazi germany atrocities, I'd hardly say that " It won't happen here". While 
the US may be like a battleship, battleships *do* turn around, even if it 
takes longer than other ships (esp when you assuage fears of the "slippery 
slope" the whole way round)

As it was in the Soviet union, yet (contrary to the beliefs and/or 
wishes of some on this list) we have neither a communist nor a 
fascist government, but a constitutional democracy whose citizens 
possess rights to life, liberty, property, appeal, public defence and 
public advocacy.  Stop arguing against America by bringing up the

Ahh, the domino theory again!  First of all, I didn't write that.  
Second of all, how long would you tolerate an agressive blusterer 
brandishing a weapon at your wife and kids?  No longer than your 
average police officer, I assume.  But he should not be forced to 
relinquish his weapon for merely stating that he would defend his 
home and person.  Try using MY rhetoric against me next time; I'd 
truly appreciate it if you'd get it right.

As long as the cops aren't banging down his door, there's no

If they abrogate their rights by committing violent crimes, abusing 
their spouses and/or children, developing legitimately certifiable 
psychoses, then they NEED to be disarmed, and the sooner the 
better.  If not, there's no problem.

Universal background checks prior to all transfers, and enforced 
penalties for those who, knowing that they're ineligible to purchase 
(due to age, violent criminal or abuser record, or documented 
mental illness resulting in a judgment of diminished responsibility) 
guns, nevertheless attempt to circumvent these laws and acquire 
them.

But not impossible to guard against.  I assume that any remotely 
contestable judgment would be fought tooth and nail by the NRA; 
maybe this is an advocacy role they could play in the future - admit 
that some sort of screening system, which still allows the vast 
majority to own guns if they so choose, is necessary for the public 
good, and labor to keep it honest.

If one has been convicted of either, that should be it.  People 
should also be required to relinquish their weapons while a pending 
case is before the court, (the most likely time for a spouse abuser 
to resort to murder-suicide), but they should be returned upon 
acquittal.  People against whom a peace bond has been taken out 
should not be anywhere around their spouse anyway, but if they 
show a propensity to ignore/violate court restrictions, the guns 
should be confiscated for the spouse's safety.

Does being free demand that one be free perpetually carry the 
means to commit mass murder-at-a-distance, any time, at a 
moment's notice, even if one is underage, a violent criminal, or 
certifiably insane?  What does this say about the right to life, or 
even the freedom, of those unknowingly around such a  person?

If you belong on the above list and are unwilling to relinquish your 
gun, then I fervently hope that the same can be said of you (I mean 
the part about not living to see the sun set), for the self-defence of 
all of us.  Confiscation of means of mass murder held by the 
insane, underage or violent criminals is the only way to prevent 
them from oppressing and killing others.  If they would rather die 
before they relinquish their weapon, it can just as certainly be 
removed from their dead body.  I am not advocating that anyone not 
belonging to the above categories who possesses a gun should 
have to relinquish it, so go suck that straw man's dick somewhere 
else.

I have given those in another post; conviction should be sufficient, 
as well as provisional confiscation while court proceedings are 
pending or underway, or if a peace bond has been granted and the 
person has shown a willingness to disregard such orders.  Did this 
strike a personal nerve, Mike?  Conservative authoritarian types DO 
have the highest rates of such abuse.

Look up the word "slave" in your dictionary. If you can read.  After someone
has explained what it means, explain to me realistically how "If someone
doesn't carry a gun, they are a slave".

>and yup...other countries in the world have teenagers killing each other

List some articles if it is so common. By the way, did you know Clinton and
Yeltsin got together with many other world leaders and have big sex and
drug orgies?  Yeah, it happens all the time, thats why there is absolutely
no
news coverage of it.  Give me a break.  SURELY, you seen my point.

Probably spend months sulking, no?  Your caps above says it all. Are you
proud of that fact?  Yeah everyone is moving to the US because they can get
away with anything.  I've been hearing about cold hard facts. Shit, why
don't members of this list form their own paramilitary terrorist groups and
start killing innocent people?  It seems like they have the mind-frame and
sense to pull it off.  A government IS required as is control, people should
determine what freedom really is.  Without some form of governmental or
legal control, the world and every country in it would destroy itself. That
is why governments exist and were formed.  If some people want to live in a
world of chaos, murder and psychotic mindframes than so be it. It will be
the rest of us that will walk past you when your unreasonable senses have
brought you all to shoot each other.

<SNIP>

Remember the Dunblane massacre in Scotland where so many infants were shot
and killed?  After that there was an uproar and the government acted on it.
Now the UK has probably the toughest gun laws on the planet. Freedom?
Despite these laws, we are not any less free than those in the US. We're
just free without worrying so much whether our kids will be shot to death at
school or whether a burglar will easily shoot us to death when they break
into our homes.

I cannot believe people use freedom as leverage behind having the right to
carry a gun. It is pointless in this day and age. Sounds to me like many
people believe they are still living in the world as it was 200 year ago.

In the UK, when crimes involve guns special police units take care of it.
You see, in the UK they actually employ police officers that are trained for
those situations. Unlike in the US where people obviously have so little
faith in the law enforcement agencies that they feel they must deal death
themselves. As for protecting yourself, chances are, in a situation where
they police don't have time to respond, you'd probably be dead anyway before
you have a chance to brand your gun and do that bit of shooting which people
are just dying to do (no pun intended). Is that a wrong perspective?  Well,
then why dictate you need a gun to 'defend' yourself, what else do you plan
on doing with a gun?

Rick

I hope the security agencies are listening. Maybe they could ATTEMPT to take

potentially dangerous.

The PPa idea has pretty thoroughly been discredited, on the 
grounds that ANY organization which assumes the functions of a 
government has a tendency to become a de facto, if not de jure, 
government and any safeguards which are built in to prevent this 
may be co-opted by the PPA and used against those whom they 
were created to protect.  To try to have a government without 
having a government is a futile exercise in self-contradiction.  Just 
admit that we need governance, and ceaselessly go about evolving 
the best feasible entity for the purpose.  I do not think we can do 
without executive, legislative, judiciary, constitution and popular 
vote, for the phenomenological reasons stated above.

It is that uncertainty that make many anti-gunners anxious. Many people on
this list have clearly stated that they would do anything to stop their guns
being taken away. Stable minds?  I am no psychologist but even I have to
question the potential danger behind that thought.

Such epithets are thrown at every prochoice person in America; it

use the spectre of Nazi Germany or slavery to justify right-wing

Do guns imply violence, or merely the intention of the carrier to meet
attempted violence with equal force?

How can one show the ability to defend oneself unless there is some clear
sign that the means to do so are present? Talk is cheap. Having the gun
present may be all that is needed to prevent a situation where violence
would occur.

Absolute agreement with your stepfather's advice. I have taught my children
just that, and I hope that they never need to actually pull a gun anywhere
other than the target range.

Pulling a gun is very different than carrying one. It's the difference
between being ABLE to shout threats and actually doing so. Unless someone
is considering doing you harm, why should they be intimidated by the fact
that you are obviously armed?

Like I said; you can't argue against my list, so you build your own 
straw list to argue against and try to bulldoze a slippery slope 
between them.  It does not work.  My proposed laws are eminently 
reasonable, do not discriminate against any identifiable racial, 
sexual, ethnic or religious group, and you have no counter against 
them.

You'd rather keep them min jail than deny them guns and give 
them a chance to prove themselves.  All doing time proves is that 
they can survive our prison system (not in itself a sterling 
recommendation).  They have proven that, given access to a free 
society that they can break the law and physically attack others; 
let them prove that they can abide by it and refrain from such 
actions.  If, after a number of years, they wish to appeal for these 
rights to be restored, and after due consideration, are judged 
responsible enough to once again receive them, I have no problem 
with that.  The same logic for abusers and the mentally ill; let's see 
first how well the psychiatric treatment or the anger control classes 
have worked in practice before we once again shove a gun in 
someone's fist.

For most of our history, uncontrolled access to weapons has been 
the rule, rather than the exception.  How do you then explain the 
rampant homicide occurring in our country?  It seems that we're 
always breeding new killers to replace the old, and it would be 
better not to allow those who are identifiable as much more likely 
to murder the opportunity to gun down those who would not.

Well, now such evidence has been posted, and since you don't like 
its conclusions, you'll do your dead-level best to ignore or impeach 
it.

Well, bullets have a strange tendency to go where the muzzle is 
aimed when the trigger is pulled, and ther's no certain way, short of 
hermitude (self-removal from society), to avoid the possibility.

Yep.

As far as the bombs - how the hell did they ever manage to emplace them?
That school must have had no security at all. On the other hand - lighting
a fuse or closing a switch is lots less obvious than firing a gun...

Because the criminals migrate to the states without concealed

were the entire US concealed-carry, that this would persuade them

If they're really drunk, they don't care if you're armed, or just don't 
think you'll use it.  A fellow holding a 357 magnum was backed 
through his house into his own back bedroom closet by four of 
them in my hometown (Pensacola, FL), before he opened up and 
killed them all.  The police ruled it a justified use of deadly force, 
and I concur.

When a comparison might augur in your favor, you accentuate the

I'd much rather him not have the gun, if I can keep it out of his

You can have yours if you're not a violent criminal, a spouse and/or

society shouldn't need your criminal, insane, abusive or underaged

You accuse me of asking for what I have not asked for (unless you

    No, I believe that the UNIX Code is MUCH better written than the Windows
95/NT code, they were coded by different people, but a friend of mine claims
to have his Linux/PII-350 decifering packets at an average rate of 2X his
NT/PII-400 PC..  I have Dual Celeron 504's here and would like to see what
it is capable of.

    You forget that programmers STILL can optimize code if they want to :-)

This seems also a list of those most likely to disregard whatever laws may stand
between them and their goals.  It may have the effect of forcing them to obtain
their guns from the black market or through theft; perhaps the stupidest ones
would be caught in the attempt.

Don't get me wrong, I don't wish to see those prone to initiating violence heavily
armed, but then neither do I wish to see them roaming at large, armed or not (if
we have to discuss whether they should be armed we have already arrived at the
wrong question).  I am concerned, however, with what the political process may do
to us in process of turning your "common sense" into the usual incomprehensible
mish-mash.  Politicians seem generally not nearly as concerned with the probable
outcomes of their actions as they are with being seen "taking action", which IMHO
is what is driving the recent spurt of gun-banning proposals.  Since their general
response to failure is to keep doing whatever produced the failure, but harder
(ref: War On Some Drugs, gov't schools, public housing, welfare, etc etc), I do
believe the "slippery slope" is a real concern.

Let me rephrase the recent statements:

  (1) If there existed a preponderance of evidence showing that violence
      does in fact _decrease_ when people are allowed to freely contact
      each other, would the proponents of totalitarianism turn into
      libertarians?

  (2) If there existed a preponderance of evidence showing that violence
      does in fact _decrease_ when strict military curfew is imposed, and
      all citizens are allowed to leave their cells and meet only under 
      the supervision of military personnel for productive purposes, would
      the proponents of individual liberties support the military regime?


You need a lot stronger reasons to deny all people individual liberties
and rights of self-protection for the common good, than for letting them
keep their freedom.

To decrease violence _and_ increase liberty, the government could legalize
marijuana, MDMA and psychedelics.  That would remove lots of reasons for
offensive use of guns, and make people less likely to use any violence for
any other reasons.  Easier on the budget, too, than gun control.

Hey, I think we might actually have a coherent and polite dialog
going on here... will wonders never cease?  :)

A few posts back, I wrote

  I gather the impression that, unlike many "ban the gun" advocates,
  you don't mind gun ownership by non-felons, and you own weapons
  yourself.  Sadly it appears that most mass shooters are not
  convicted felons *at the time they commit their attacks*, and
  banning the possession of guns by _potential_ shooters would
require
  massive infringements of civil rights- for who can identify a
  potential shooter?  Psychological screening for firearms
purchases? 
  The possibilities for political abuse of such a system would be
  large.

I must admit that I was putting up a bit of a strawman; the only
credible standard for restricting possession on "mental" grounds is
via due process in the courts, imperfect but the best we have.

On the other hand, some states' laws include "anyone ever committed
for mental observation", which could be abused if not kept in the
public eye.  The burden of proof should be on the regulatory agency,
of course, and I feel a commitment for observation should not in
itself be grounds for dispossession, since it is an investigatory
action, not a result of due process.

As with all things human, some dangerous people would not be
identified, while some actually harmless people might lose some
rights without due process.  The question moves to, "How effective
are these laws?"

I misattributed this quote:

Oops, my error.  I mistook Rick@cyborg.force9.net for you, probably
due to a similarity in your styles.  My apologies, I have no good
excuse, but it was an error, not a deliberate distortion.

The legislation you seek is already in effect, for example in
California:

   POSSESSION

   It is unlawful for anyone convicted of a felony, or who is
   a drug addict, present or former mental patient, ever committed
   for mental observation, or acquitted by reason of insanity to
   own or possess any firearm. People with certain misdemeanor
   convictions involving force or violence may not possess or own
   any firearm within 10 years of the conviction. A person who
   has been adjudicated as a juvenile offender or delinquent for
   any offense which would be classified as a felony or misdemeanor
   involving force or violence if committed by an adult may not
   own or possess any firearm until age 30. A minor may not possess
   a handgun except with written permission or under the
   supervision of a parent or guardian.

Another quibble with the above is the "drug addict" part- what
drugs, and what definition of addiction?  I'll have to look further,
but that's probably anyone who has signed up for a publicly funded
detox program, such as methadone maintenance.  If that's so, then
due process has kinda sorta been satisfied, but perhaps the
paperwork for voluntary drug treatment commitment should include the
warning that certain civil rights are signed away by that act.

A friend of mine in Colorado was a heroin addict twenty years ago,
but has been clean ever since then.  As it turns out, Colorado law
does not have a "drug addict" clause, so her possession of firearms
(and she protected *me* from assault once) is legal in Colorado.  I
doubt she'll move to California anytime soon though...

Ok, you have a more reasonable position than Rick... and that
position is already law in many states.  Enforcement is a tough one,
though- the cops & DAs are up to their eyeballs in this bloody
useless war on drugs (but that's a flamewar for another day <grin>).

Agreed, with rights come responsibilities.  Persons shown by due
process, on public record, to be in that set above are in most
jurisdictions in the US already banned from gun ownership.  Thus I
think we have little to truly disagree on.

The ability to detonate unobtrusively is also a product of technique

I consider my proposals as rational, reasonable, rather limited, and 
no great threat to our fine democracy.  Wait'll a wolf appears to cry

Heh heh- back when I drove a cab, I learned that stoned passengers
are much to be preferred over drunken ones.

A) They are friendly and usually polite
B) They don't puke in the car
C) You can crank up the stereo, take a longer route, and they'll
   still tip ya

That's a freedom most can do without, and that can only be 
exercised once and with heavy legal consequence.  It does not 
matter.  The dead are still dead, and the most grisly revenge 
execution will neither resurrect his victims nor deter the killers of 
future ones.  Just tell me that Harris and Klebold feared the death 
penalty.

Are the ones around the irresponsible and homicidal gunman who 
can lose their lives without their knowledge or consent and are in 
actual danger of doing so free at all, or merely unaware that they 
are even less than slaves, but sheep in the slaughtering pen?  I, for 
one, do not want to live under that kind of slavery, the slavery of 
random violence, any more than necessary, and consider the 
denial of gun purchase, possession or ownersip to violent 
criminals, the mentally deficient and/or deranged, spouse and/or 
child abusers, and children to be a rational and reasonable 
measure to take in order to limit the exposure of the general 
citizenry to such a threat.

The fact that you're a stranger, who might well be a violent criminal 
or a lunatic AND legally armed (if a lot of the full mooners here have 
their way) should be enough to chill the typical spine, which I would 
be loathe to turn in his/her direction for fear of being backshot.  If I 
had legal assurance that most likely the person wearing the gun 
was responsible, well that's another story.

I would like to believe that, but I am neither an optimist nor a 
pessimist, but strive to be a realist.  Since so much either way 
goes unreported, I can only say that not only do I not know, but I 
do not think anyone else honestly does, either.

Exactly why I specified "violent criminal".  I do not believe that 
those who have committed nonviolent or victimless crimes such as 
marijuana use, homosexuality, gambling, prostitution, etc. should 
be deprived of their right to keep and bear.  I have never advocated 
their inclusion in such statutes.

If this country is invaded, yes.  Otherwise, it would depend upon

My friend noted that as Ecstacy was discovered in 1912
in Germany, its fast proliferation in the ruling class
would make the Germans assert the glory of their culture
by supporting arts and poetry and sharing their technological
skills with other nations.  The world wars wouldn't have 
happened.   Granted, MDMA might adversely affect one's
memory, but I believe concentration camps caused more health
loss.   I wonder if anybody studied the reduction of violence
caused by MDMA use.

It would take a second for a strong man to kill
a weak person with bare hands. (Would you prohibit
strong hands as a visible threat?]  Without a weak
person having a gun, they are at a mercy of any
criminal, and have no deterrent.

As for mass murders, one can just drive a car into a
crowd.  Now, how many people die from mass murderers?
And how many people die from eating unhealthy food
from MacDonalds, smoking, including secondary, etc.?
Bearing guns is a constitutional right, and mass murders
are probably the case of deaths number one thousand
something.  Why not take care of the top of the list
of deaths first, especially when it doesn't violate
anybody's constitutional rights?  Just because mass
murders sound more dangerous and look more photogenic?

The people who do these things are using the propwer tool; guns 
are specifically designed to be efficient at-a-distance multiple 
killers, and perform the function very well.  They should be kept out 
of the hands of those most likely to use them on innocents.

The latest Star Wars episode made me wonder: can technology
go backwards?  They seemed to imply technology was going
violently aft.  Can anyone think of an example, now or in any time
past, where a society had it and later didn't?  Descended from
enlightenment to superstition?  Would dark ages Europe qualify?  spike

The thrust of my whole position is to remove guns from the hands 
of those most likely to misuse them (violent criminals, the mentally 
defective and/or deranged, spouse and/or child abusers, and 
children), and tp prevent them from getting them in the first place.  I 
have no problems with the rest of the citizenry keeping their guns.

Drunk or deranged or homicidal or underaged drivers shouldn't be 
allowed to drive, anymore than these people should be handling 
firearms.   People kill themselves smoking, drinking and eating bad 
food.  Other people kill the victims of gun violence.

One trick you might try is this (if you are running some form
of Windows): when you notice your computer being slow, do an
alt-tab to see if it shows up as a task. If so then you are
running it the wrong way. You don't want it to show up there,
or else it will be running constantly, even when you are doing
something else. What you want is to just have it set up as your
screen saver, and also showing up as the little green thing in
your taskbar tray.

Partially. To have a technology, you need to have the supporting
infrastructure to make it work. When the Roman empire fell, many
technologies such as building techniques were no longer useful or even
possible due to lack of transports and materials, so they fell into
disuse and were at least partially lost. 

Something like this is less likely today due to the wide dispersal of
information on how to make (say) silicon chips and everything
else. But if we imagine a major economic disaster that for a period of
a few decades forces society back to basic farming and industry,
bootstrapping chip production afterwards would not be entirely trivial
even whith handbooks and old engineers at hand. To make a chip, you
need the machines for that, and they in turn require other technology,
and so on - it would be very hard to make a copy of a current Intel
plant without having to make a copy of much of the current
technological infrastructure.

Please expand on your definition of deficient, as you just a short while
ago included those who voted for Republi-
Christians as being mentally unfit for gun
ownership:

>I don't want to repeal the 2nd Amendment,
>I just want to restrict gun ownership to, >mainly, those who can vote
(with a few >exceptions, such as abusers and the >mentally incompetent

Was this a serious statement or just tossed out in the heat of the
flamewar?
Either way, sir, it does you little credit.
Would you seek similar limits on the 1st amendment rights of such
people?

Please clarify your parameters for declaring someone deficient.

Thank you.

I don't mind the periodic off-topic posts.  Occasionally, a thread will
stray into areas better suited for other newsgroups.  I've posted off-topic
myself from time to time.  But usually such threads die out after 10 or 15
posts at the most.  The last week or so I've been getting almost 200 posts a
day from the ExI list and 80%+ are guns/property material.  I think its time
to take these discussions elsewhere.  Elsewise, my kill file will begin to
grow.

Well, we've polled for birth order & Myers-Briggs ratings, so how about:

How many people are sick of the guns flamewar, at least for now?

Also, how many would like to see:

--minimal quoting of prior messages in the aforementioned flamewar?

--at the very least, a decrease in profanity & assertions concerning the
moral, mental & genetic shortcomings of the opposition by both sides in
the aforementioned flamewar?

I'll tally the data.

We could also just enforce the existing laws. Theft is illegal already, as
is supplying a gun to a convicted felon, etc, etc. The black market is
already here - in Chicago a police officer was recently indicted for
gunrunning to the gangs.

I am quite pessimistic on this - having witnessed the many slippery slopes
we have slid down in the past, I expect this newest bout of 'gun control'
to be no different. No individual can do anything about it that would be
productive, but possibly enough of us together can. That's why I support
the Libertarian party. At least I am trying to change things from within
the system. I also have joined the NRA and the Illinois Rifle Association,
primarily to get a better deel for what the true 'gun nuts' are doing, and
to register my support for SOME of their programs.

I do not agree with all the NRA's positions, but like the Libertarians,
they stand for many of my own ideals.

Someone giggling to himself in a drugged stupor is unlikely to cause
problems to anyone, as long as he's not in control of dangerous machinery
at the time. Beyond that, let 'em smoke whatever they want. I don't care.
If the person endangers someone else, use existing laws to deal with it.

There's BIG MONEY in the 'war on drugs' and all it implies. I had a
business associate try to get me to invest in his 'new, improved' home drug
screening kit - he wants to sell it to schools, prisons, businesses, and
you and me - and expects to make several hundred million dollars in the
first two years. Big money == no change.

I should expand: I am in favor of those who pass a licensing test, and meet
the other criteria of gun ownership, to carry UNCONCEALED weapons, just as
police officers do. Along with this would be a quasi-deputy-cop position,
similar to the volunteer fireman we have in many areas. These people would
have all the responsibilities of the police as to when and if they shoot.
Unconcealed carry is legal in some areas already - Arizona comes to mind -
and I don't recall many problems being related to it getting into the
national news.

Concealed weapons obviously do not become a factor in any encounter until
they are drawn, or at least made visible. My fuddled brain at work there..

Hence my suggestion. Any police officer or citizen could request the gun
carrier's credentials, and could report any who appeared to be carrying
without proper license.

Pre-Christian societies (Greeks) had knowledge of steam power,
(Babylonians?) electricity (old electroplating plating batteries found in
ruins) and that the Earth was round and not the center of the universe.
Most of this was lost in the rise of Western civilization and the Dark
Ages. Does it matter that the technology was used primarily as special
effects in temples?

If we were to suffer a planetary disaster that killed off most of our
technicians and scientists, modern mass production and microelectronics
would become tales of a lost civilization, as no one person could
resurrect, for instance, even a small semiconductor fab by himself. Our
civilization is only robust when you consider the pool of resources made
available by the billions of people out there, and the thousands of
different companies competing to make product. A few ill-placed meteor
strikes could indeed send us back twenty or thirty years, effectively.

This does not imply that the actual knowledge is lost - just that the
know-how to make the knowledge into product is missing. The field-effect
transistor was known in the early years of the 20th century as a
possibility, to physicists, as was nuclear fission, but until the
infrastructure developed to make either viable, they remained dreams.

What precisely in the movie are you referring to? The only clear incident
of technology that might have disappeared in the movie is the neato-keen
droid space fighters. I couldn't see that their performance was
sufficiently worse then the human controlled fighters in Star Wars to
justify switching. All of the other technology in the movie seemed to
perform sufficiently "retro" relative to the tech in the later movies. For
example in Return of the Jedi they get the performace of those "pods" in
speeder bikes that noticeably DON'T have to have Rolls-Royce jet engines
strapped to the front :)

Enough of the flames. I am only interested in serious discussion. Profanity
and personal attacks are a sign that the writer is running out of real
substance.

What is a good guideline for quoting? It seems that you need enough so that
a new reader at least can see where the thread came from.

With the right knowledge we can eliminate the negative side of humanity.
Humanity will develop methods to control and regulate feelings and emotions,
increase intelligence, and eliminate mental illness. People will have a mental
heaven through mind-shaping. People will have healthy minds free from any mental
agony such as depression, because all mental illness will be cured. Humans will
discover how to access and unleash the full capabilities and power of the brain,
and thereby reach levels of intelligence and thought that takes the essence of
being to an unimaginably complete state of existence. Humanity will be able to
achieve control of the brain so one can elect to have any feeling or emotion
desired, or elect to avoid any feeling or emotion. One will be able to have pure
thought unaffected by feelings or emotions, and unrestrained by sensory or other
limitations. Such mind-shaping methods may involve the use of chemicals and/or
genetic engineering to enhance the pleasure pathways of the brain, and block
negative feedback pathways. This would result is a perpetual state of happiness,
pleasure, and joy. Boredom, anger and other negative feelings and emotions will
no longer plague man. People will be happy about being in a state of happiness,
a perpetual love of everything. Each individual will have the capability to
completely control their thoughts, and thereby be the god of their own universe,
the king of their mental sphere of existence.  Such full mental satisfaction
will have profound positive impacts on current paradigms. For example, drug
abuse, crime, and war will become obsolete, because mentally satisfied people
have no need or desire to engage in such activities. Predators will no longer
exist, and police will become unnecessary.

Cheers,
Jon

I don't mind.  I just killfile anything on this list with "guns" or
"property rights" anywhere in the body. And I can do that with the
Netscape mail program for Windows, so I assume that almost any program
can manage killfiling.

No, it's not perfect, and occasionally maybe I miss something, but it's
a pretty painless solution.

There are also several collaborative filtering systems for e-mail, and
an even wider selection of newsreaders:
http://www.mmt.bme.hu/~meszaros/work/doc/infosys/filtering/free-software.html

Anybody have a favorite collaborative filtering programs?  I haven't
tried any of these out yet.  I would think that if we were all using the
same system, it would be more effective, since the program would have
more data to work with.

There are examples of that.  Loss of technology has been known to happen
when a branch of a civilization gets cut off from the main branch.  Small
groups cannot maintain the level of sophistication that larger groups
can.  And when there are not enough members of the group, so that all
technology can be passed from one generation to the next, technology is
lost.

The Stratavarious family died out and the making of a Statavarious violin
is a lost technology.

I'm out of town until Monday and on the run, but feel compelled to respond to

Not only would I support such a reduction, but as soon as I have some time, 
intend to take steps to enforce the list guidelines all subscribers have 
agreed to when joining the list.  

So it's clear, ALL POSTERS ON THE GUN THREADS PLEASE READ THIS:

The list guidelines clearly prohibit personalistic attacks and the kind of 
offensive rhetoric I've seen in the sampling of the recent gun debate I've 
seen.  There have been enough complaints about it that I consider ExI's Board 
to have freedom of action to notify offenders of list suspension.

As a lawyer and someone interested in social issues (including politics), I 
believe this list IS a proper place for reasoned and civil discussion of 
social issues.  But offensive language and personalistic rhetoric does not 
have a place here.  This limit on behavior is clearly set out in the 
subscription terms.  List suspension is our only real sanction -- so folks 
who have engaged in offensive and personalistic rhetoric, please consider 
yourself on notice.

I was recently asked whether I thought the future would be more like
Blade Runner or like Star Trek.  My vote?  It'll be more like Marvel
Comics.

All of the various superhero myths are about people with human
personalities but superhuman abilities, most of which may be possible
someday with nano.  Extropian in spirit, I think.

I was in java, and it wasn't dowloading my pictures, a warning box came up,
stating that I didn't have enough memory. So I removed setti and it worked
fine. I didn't want to remove it, seeing as I just dowloaded the software a
night or two before, but I'd rather get some work done.

The following was sent to the transhuman list a while back. BS
or viable technology, any expert opinions (see below)? For the time 
being, I think that regular stun guns and pepper/CS/UV dye combo 
sprays are the best non-lethal choice for self-defense. On a more
lethal note: a (cross)bow might be a reasonable compromize if you
can't/don't want to own a gun. They're legal in most countries afaik (no
registration, no hassles), and the heavier models pack an awesome
punch; will nail an intruder right to the wall. Ok, it's a cumbersome
weapon, but it's a lot better than nothing. Using the the above 
mentioned non-lethals and knives as backups, one could presumably 
put up a good fight. As an added bonus, a heavy (cross)bow is virtually
kid-proof (because of the strength required to operate it).

Wednesday, May 12, 1999 Published at 18:11 GMT 19:11 UK 

            Sci/Tech

            Set phasers on stun 

            It could immobilise its victim without doing permanent harm 

            A ray gun that can stop people in their tracks without
            harming them may sound like science fiction, but some
            experts believe it could soon be reality. 

            The gun is designed to zap its victim with an electric
            current, using a laser to carry the charge along a beam
            of ultraviolet light. 

            The light particles, called photons, would create a path
            through the air that will be capable of conducting
            electricity up to a distance of about 100 metres (330
            feet). 

            When the current hits someone, it would interfere with
            the tiny electrical charges that control the victim's
            muscles, making movement impossible. 

            Vital organs protected 

            But vital organs like the heart and diaphram would not be
            affected because they are protected by a greater
            thickness of body tissue. 


                        Weapons that freeze muscles are
                        already on sale in the United States,
                        but in order to work they have to be
                        held against the victim's skin. They
                        also have to be recharged after each
                        use. 

            Apart from having a considerable range, the new 'freeze
            ray gun' could in theory be fired around corners if mirrors
            were used. It could also have a constant power source. 

            Talks in California 

            The gun is the brainchild of American inventor, Eric Herr,
            vice-president of HSV technologies. Scientists from the
            UK's Defence Evaluation Research Agency have already
            been to California to discuss it with him. 

            No details of the discussions have been disclosed, but a
            spokesman for the UK Ministry of Defence said the
            weapon's potential uses were being considered. 

            So far, Mr Herr's ray gun remains just an idea. He has
            taken out a patent on the device, but has yet to raise the
            $500,000 needed to build a full working prototype. 

            'Ideal weapon' 

            Initially, the 'freeze ray' could be the size of a small
            suitcase, but might eventually be reduced to something
            more like a flashlight. 

            Mr Herr believes it could be an ideal weapon for
            peace-keeping forces, or police facing violent criminals. 

            But already the project has its critics. They argue that
            such a laser would be impractical in many situations,
            and could easily damage the sight of innocent
            by-standers.

So there should be a lot less reasons to object carrying a phaser
stun than a conventional gun.  Somehow I doubt that it would be
permitted.  I'd be happy to carry one though, especially if it's
small and not too expensive.  Should somebody help him collect money
for a prototype?  sounds like a good investment.

And I don't think our ideas on issues of technology and liberty i
the long-term future are worth much if we can't logically analyze
the existing evidence of the current ones.   Doing something now
to influence the future is the best use we can put our visions to.
That includes resolution of controversial issues and development
of new technologies, whether by writing code or making investments.

If anybody find anything decent there, _please_ let me know.

Unfortunately, most systems (all I know from this list) either
are dead, or are small/old experimental projects for obscure
newsreaders (like nn), or are non-collaborative, or turned
into something else.

I started my own Newsfilter project that is currently at the very
beginning of practical development, but I hope it has a bright future.
It is public and open-source, web-based, at least in the first stage,
will have collaborative and concept filtering in staged implementations.

The funding for this project has been provided by my company,
Intelligenesis Corp., the coding work is performed by the
Russian E-spaces <www.e-spaces.com> team.

There is also a distributed Newsfilter group that debates features
of this project in its own mailing list.

If you want to help define this service and take part in developing it,
please visit the URL below and share your opinions.

I also have a number of texts (see Semantic Web, ACF and Semantic Transports,
Message Rating Proposal articles on my site) on the perspectives of semantic filtering, and originally hoped for the extropians to take a more active
position than hoping that somebody else sometime will develop some
intelligent knowledge filters.  But the main thing, it has a good plan,
finally, a good team, and it's starting.

Wanna help?

	hehe noooooooooooo! i dunno. i think this has been quite interisting. 
and anyway, doug jones and joe dees seem to have come to some operative 
conclusions about some things that were being debated, and i concur with 
those. i think good has come of this, and i think that, in the future, we 
should never shrink from dicussions like this; we should never shrink at the 
chance to slay sacred cows.

Here's a topic: what is "children's literature", and why?  That is,
what makes a particular story suitable for children, and how could
good stories that already exist be adapted for them (assuming one
gets around the impediment of copyright)?  Certainly, books for very
young children are just simpler English and less complex stories,
but I'm thinking more of the prime education years: ages 6-12, where
kids are beyond Dr. Seuss but aren't ready for Salinger.  How would
one go about adapting, say, a Greg Egan story for the Hardy Boys'
audience, without dumbing it down?

How about the 'Danny Dunn' books & the

& a smart, rational kid detective, respectively)?  Both series impactd

I'm not absolutely sure about this..but I think that Japan discovered 
gunpowder a loooooong time ago.  They supressed it.  The reasoning was that 
their culture was based on the Samurai....swordsmen. A swordsman is not much 
good against a gunman.

Later of course they ran up against a culture which had not suppressed 
gunpowder and were dogmeat.  The moral of the story being survival of the 
fittest. Fittest being the biggest boys with the biggest toys...

	hehe hmmm... so whaddya think of martial artists? are we more likely 
to be violent? how does that fit in to this? and whats the diff between an 
average martial artist and an average guy with a gun?
	i think the main diff is education. many martial artists, like many 
legal gun owners, know what their doing, and how to do it, and what it does, 
and what the reprocussions of using their violence are. they are not ignorant 
about their ability for violence. ergo, they are more likely to be 
intellegent in their use of violence... and i think that makes all the 
difference.

Just to provide an historical reminder: it /has/ happenned here.
The internment of Japanese-Americans was clearly illegal, but no
one in the chain of command had the courage to stop it.  And need
I even mention the treatment of American Indians?  Yes, I'm glad
that our government is set up to make certain kinds of tyranny
more difficult, but if the public sees something or someone as an
enemy (take "drug user" for example, or "illegal alien"), democracy
won't get in the way of the people marginalizing or dehumanizing
them.  It takes individuals with conscience, a loud voice, and the
means to back it up to fight such trends.

I was in fact thinking of those droid fighters.  Definitely more advanced

armor that evidently didnt protect them from anything.  I would like
to have one or or two of those droid warriors.  {8^D

In retrospect, I think this might be part of the joke.  I liked this episode
more than the previous ones.  I liked their explanation for the force too,

Thanks Elizabeth.  This is why I always liked Batman better than
Superman or any of the others: because Batman and his youthful
ward Robin used only technology.  Neither they, nor their foes
had supernatural powers.  Just technology.  I always wished Simon
bar Sinister would win out over Underdog, because Underdog
had supernatural powers, whereas Simon used only science and
technology.  Too bad he was evil.  {8^D  spike

EvMick, that reminds me of the scene in Temple of Doom where a

Indiana Jones.  hoyoooyaawoooyaaa, says he, twirling the swords.

James, the Encyclopedia Brown collection is great.  It gave
me hope that the bookish nerdy kid could actually win
out in the end.  I liked Danny Dunn too, but Encyclopedia
Brown rules.  {8^D  spike

I don't recall seeing any such post, and I'd honestly like to see
it if one exists.  I did see the two URLs from HCI; they present some
arguments (some valid, some not) for why Lott's study might be flawed,
but I have yet to see any actual study that supports the opposite
conclusion, and I assume that if such a study existed, HCI would be
happy to refer to it.  The only statistics quoted on HCI are far
less rigorous and complete than Lott's.

Here's a link to a good discussion of Lott on Friedman's site:

Lee, this is a gooood question.  I will confess here, I still read
"children's literature" on occasion.  The Newbery award series
is terrific.  Some of these books I read as a child.  This gave me
the idea that they might have been some of my most important
influences.  This and the sci-fi: Danny Dunn, Encyclopedia
Brown to name two of the more memorable examples.  There
are some excellent stories among the Newbery winners.  I
can name most of the characters in "A Wrinkle in Time" after
27 years.  spike

In order to ionize the air in a column enough to carry a current strong
enough to be effective against a person the laser will need to be pretty
powerful in its' own right. How are they going to prevent the laser itself
from doing harm to the target? Powerful UV lasers make great hole drillers.

By the way - where is the return path for the stun beam? If it's through
the ground and back into the wielder's body, this could become a very
unpopular method of defense.

< 
  I presume one of the purposes of this would be to stimulate traffic
on your web site. I suggest the way to go about this in a most time and
cost effective manner would be to accumulate select medline postings of
interest in various categories. Some of these would benefit from
additional quotes from the research papers they are derived from for the
purposes of clarification, but in general medline has already done the
work of typing into electronic form the written abstracts which preface
most modern research reports found in medical journals.
  The idea here is to let the web surfer make up his own opinion about
various points, without being dictated to, lectured to, etc. A few select
comments might be useful, such as vitamin E not actually reducing CVD
mortality, but only reducing the incidence of non-fatal heart
attacks, while omega-3 fatty acids having basically the reverse effect.
However I believe these types of comments should be strictly limited, or
they will likely become counterproductive - even they are not untrue.
  A further note of caution. Much has been made in the past about the
effect of various interventions on animal longevity. The animals used
often die of conditions far different from that of most humans. It
may be useful to add to postings about animal studies just what major
diseases the animals actually die of, so the reader will not be
falsely impressed or unimpressed by the data.
 A case in point is the often used C57BL mice. These die of lymphoma
cancer, which is a disease that afflicts few humans. A treatment which
reduces cardiovascular disease mortality, but has a side effect of
slightly increasing lymphoma cancer risk will likely increase C57BL mouse
mortality, even as it decreases that of humans.
 Even when the animal species more closely resembles humans, experimental
conditions can invalidate the results. A case in point is the effect of
peanuts on cardiovascular disease. Monkeys fed peanut oil have an
increased atherosclerosis, on a very high cholesterol diet, which is
standard on virtually all experiments with animals, so that this disease
is rapidly induced. The trouble is that humans who eat peanuts actually
live longer than those that do not, which is not what one would expect 
from most animal experiments. The solution to this seeming contradiction,
is that when monkeys are fed (by human standards) a "normal" cholesterol
diet peanut oil sharply reduces atherosclerosis, and the monkey results
then are entirely consistent with human epidemiological surveys.
 Unfortunately many animal experiments are a waste of taxpayer's money.
They are often conducted by closeted scientists who are not often called
to account for their misdeeds. A rare exception is the recent
official public repudiation by the Canadian government, of animal research
which falsely gives the impression that canola oil can increase
human mortality. The animal used (SHRSP) is not a valid model for human
cardiovascular disease, and any results obtained with it are therefore
invalid for human application.
 Unfortunately even with medline posts one can be entirely mislead. As
with all things, buyer beware.

Three old men

Three old men were sitting on a bench in Florida when a reporter
approached them. 'I wonder if you three would be willing to do an
interview and tell us your secret to long life,' the reported asked.
The three old men agreed.

The first old man was asked his secret to his long life. 'I never drank
alcohol, I never smoked tobacco and I have been married to the same
woman for fifty years.' 'Wow, thats really remarkable!' said the
reporter. 'And how old are you?' he asked the second man. 'I'm 93,'
said the man.

The second man was asked the same question on his secret to long life.
'I drank on occasion, I smoked, but not often and I dated some.' 'And
how old are you?' asked the reporter. 'I'm 91,' said the old man.

Finally, the reporter approached the third old man and asked his secret
to a long life. 'I dated every woman that would go out with me, I drank
until I passed out and I smoked three packs of cigarettes a day.'
'Wow!' said the reporter. 'And how old are you?' '29,' replied the man.

	hehe just pointing on that this was said, right here, on this

very much. the government debate has been hashed and rehashed on here several

theres some very good, and maybe surprising, stuff to be found...

That seems to be the real core of the religious argument: what is
freedom, anyway?  If you ask me, freedom /is/ chaos.  Freedom is
dangerous.  Freedom is a bitch.  Freedom is constant vigilance.
The simple reality is that there are dangerous psychopaths in the
world, and since they don't all have convenient labels ("Poor
Impulse Control"), giving ourselves freedom means giving it to
them as well.  Until we catch them abusing it, that means watching
your back.

If you want ease, and safety, and the ability to walk the streets
of your neighborhood without risking your life, then you're not
interested in freedom, you want security.  People will use words
like "freedom from harm", "freedom from want", etc., but they've
really co-opted the word for a very simple concept and used it to
mean something else entirely.

Freedom means being able to use your own talents to accomplish
your own desires, not the expectation that anyone else is going
to make it easy for you.

At least I've actually /read/ the arguments on both sides, and
honestly evaluated them.  I have also on more than one occasion
changed my mind on significant issues of politics and morality.
I suggest you honestly asses whether or not you can say the same
things, and whether or not you have any actual evidence that I
cannot, or are just assuming that I'm lying because of your
political prejudice.

Please post the archive URL of a post where I suggested that
any member of your proposed group should own a gun, rather
than arguing against a prohibitive law.

Nowhere in my list did I advocate a marginalization of any of the 
straw-man groups here profferred, and I personally oppose same as 
vociferously as I advocate the passage of the rational, reasonable, 
limited and commonsense laws I have previously enumerated (keep 
guns from the possession of violent criminals, the mentally 
deficient and/or deranged, spouse and/or child abusers, and 
children).  To indict A by slagging B is not only logically fallacious, 
but intellectually dishonest.

	yup, theres a diff there; a matter of scale. but how many of these 
black-beltish marksmen do we have killing innocents? very very few. thats my 
point.

	i have no problem with that, in theory... but shit. slopes are 
slippery, and making laws forcing the goons to relinquish their weapons 
requires, well, making laws, which means trusting politicians to understand 
the fine ethical line that i think is being treaded here... basicly, i agree 
with your goals but not your methods; i think ole crocker & lorray's approach 
would be, functionally, the lonterm lesser of two evils.

Certain specific techniques/technologies
can be lost; examples:

certain Etruscan & Egyptian metallurgic techniques (this from a
metalsmith friend)

China & certain mechanical technologies used in clocks, automatons, etc

the ability to read a given written language
(Etruscan, Minoan, Egyptian til the Rosetta Stone)

I'm sure there are others,but a lot of such
lost technologies are more due to a loss of social organization (try
building the pyramids without a central govt).  About the only thing
that can kill a technology is
a total loss of knowledge (rare--the European dark ages were the
flowering of
Muslim culture) or loss of access to some vital resource.

(1) I was replying to the precise text I quoted, which is not from
  you, and had nothing to do with your proposal.  Not every post in
  this thread is about you personally.  Please read it as written.

(2) I understand that you have a libertarian view of drug use and
  such.  I submit, though, that "mentally incompetent" is an equally
  ill-defined and greatly abusable category, and "violent felon" and
  "child" have problems as well.  I would have no problem with, for
  example, a judge imposing /as part of a convict's sentence/ that
  ey foreits eir right to own a gun for some period of time (up to
  and including life).  But someone who, say, got drunk and slashed
  someone with a broken bottle in a bar fight provoked by someone
  else, was duly convicted, served eir time in jail, and was
  released is now a free citizen like any other, and one hopes might
  have learned from eir mistake.  Automatically removing eir rights
  wihtout opportunity for judgment is unreasonable and unproductive.
  That's what we pay judges for: to exercise judgment.  Blanket
  prohibitions make it harder to do that.

  Note also that the recently-proposed bomb-recipe bill in Congress
  makes publishing certain information on the Internet a "Federal
  crime of violence".  If lawmakers can redefine "involuntary
  servitude" so that it doesn't include the draft, surely they can
  redefine "violence" so that it includes writing HTML.  I also
  know some 16/17-year-old girls who are responsible and rational
  enough that I would have no problem with them packing, and for
  whom it might be a good idea in their neighborhoods.

Just as you cannot meaure either the position and momentum of 
an electron absolutely and more precision in one means more error 
in another, there is no such thing as either absolute freedom or 
absolute security for embodied and mortal beings.  However, we 
can compromise between them to obtain the maximum 
simultaneous freedom and security pragmatically possible.  This 
has always been my purpose in advocating the reasonable, 
rational, logical and limited measures which I have espoused, and 
will coninue to be so.

In the absence of the the law, they are free to purchase, possess

The court system should also have a process by which one can

problem with that.

There is no other feasible method, and the only way to test mine is

Does it run local or on a server? Can it handle mailing lists?

Organics absorbs UV strongly. However, the inventors claims that no
permanent blindness will ensue sounds not quite convincing. They say
some recent UV semiconductor laser breakthrough in Poland (?) could
shrink the device to the size of a flashlight.

The current design study assumes something mounted on a vehicle, a
kind of a crowd control thing. A few cases of "accidently" burned
retina could come handy I can imagine. Of course voltage can also be
boosted to lethal levels...

One could use twin beams. No need for that, if mounted on a vehicle.

I propose that the topics Guns and Property be formally banned from the
mailing list for a cooling-off period of one year.  (All in favor of
extending this to a millennium, raise your hand.)  Violators will be
shot with stolen assault rifles.  Anyone who doesn't like this can
create or join propertyguns@onelist.com.

     I don't think any topic should be considered taboo or too controversial

stretch for transhuman discussion, at least to the extent it has been taken.  
The real gun law debate should be which laws and rights are more civilized, 
more progressive, more evolved and which is more foreseeable in a utopian 
society.

Of course the greatest legend of lost technology is the story of Atlantis.  
As far as lost technologies that we know of for certain, there is Stone Henge

A number of us were discussing the new Star Wars movie on IRC, and of
course the subject drifted to the area of "virgin" births. One solution
that was put forward was that the "Force" organisms created a
"male-ized" clone of the mother.

Here's the question. Given a female genome, is there enough info in
there for a purely typographic process to generate a male genome? Or
vice versa? Or is it necessary to "ad-lib" the missing parts to change
the gender that that particular genome will grow into.

ObExtropianism: If I were to want to move into a female clonde body for
a couple years (being male) would the genetic engineers (expert
systems?) have to exercise creativity in the design of the female body
created from my genome, or is there a one to one correspondance?

Actually, it isn't. We just had several very imformative posts on these subjects
within the last 2-3 weeks.

It would require little creativity to make a non-fertile "female
version" of your genes.  Certain genetic pecularities block 
masculinization during fetal development and produce XY females 
who are relatively normal except for some reproductive tract defects 
which are not visible.  They are, however, sterile.

Theoretically they could make a female version of you by doubling
the X chromosome although we haven't yet shown this works in people.
It is possible you'd get problems although unlikely.
Fruit fly females homozygous for the X chromosome are pretty normal.

There are some developmental issues with egg vs. sperm source of
genes which may or may not need to be resolved.

believe there was a genetic bottleneck due to low human pop numbers.
Post-colonial theorists might argue that they *chose* to abandon these evil
technologies and culturally adapted otherwise.

But they had fire-sticks, according to one source, so that last bit's
plainly wrong.  But they certainly did lose a vast amount of what was then
(so to speak) cutting edge technology.

The newsfilter, at least at first, will run on the server, that
means the user doesn't have to download and install anything.
Some of the functions eventually can be performed on the "smart"
client, starting with profile and advisor list caching.

The first implementation will be Usenet, will be easily extendable
to any other message stream as long as it has a way of addressing
messages uniquely.  Static information repositories such as Web :-)
are much easier to handle, except for the size.

We'll have to start from simple features as the team is very small,
but can do more faster if we get help :-)

The language of the project will be Java.

More details - on the project page and in the mailing list archive.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

A fantasy which I can't help considering is of a fully armed Columbine
High School.  When the boys enter and begin shooting up the room, there
is panic and several people are hit, but at least some of the kids draw
their own weapons and either shoot the attackers or at least drive them
from the building.  The net result is that many lives are saved.

Imagine that there was a private school which had a policy of allowing or
even requiring all students to carry loaded handguns at all times.  The
students would be trained in gun safety, the guns would be provided for
those who could not afford them as they enter the school, etc.

What do you think would be the effects of such a policy?  High school
boys are notoriously wild, immature, hot-tempered and prone to fighting
and violence.  If they were armed, would the daily minor fistfights become
gun battles?  Would students, not sufficiently mature to consider the
long term effects of their actions, misuse the power of their weapons
and lead to even greater violence?

I think the conventional wisdom is that they would.  Arming high school
students would be like giving a hand grenade to a six year old.  The
result would be tragedy at a scale that would make Littleton look like
Sesame Street.

And I think the conventional wisdom is correct in this case.  If I had
the option of sending my kids to a school which had newly opened and was
going to operate under this philosophy, I would not do so.  I would not
knowingly put my kids into a situation where they were surrounded on all
sides by guns, and any hot-tempered argument could instantly flare into
deadly gunfire.

Does anyone here think differently?  Does anyone believe so strongly in
the civilizing nature of firearms that they think supplying them to high
school kids as in this scenario would actually decrease violence?

There have probably been precedents...

What was the average age of first gun ownership among
the early white settlers and Indians in America?
I read lots of reports about the Third world armies
recruiting kids from like 8 years old and up.
There are probably way more teens in the third
world openly carrying guns than adults in the U.S.
How many cases of mass shooting are there?
Considering that we live in the most civilized country
in the world (yeah, right!) with kids having a lot more
knowledge of engineering and social issues, facing more
serious law enforcement, and less exposed to direct 
displays of extreme violence, the chances in U.S. must
be much, much lower.

If, on the other hand, the Third World teens are more
mature and able to carry firearms (they definitely do
carry other weapons), maybe that's because they haven't
been infantilized by overprotective governments?

I am still not sure about the teens, but in general, it seems
that the American population is becoming increasingly 
infantile, paranoid, and neurotic under the protective
shield of the government, with adult people scared of
making eye contact in the street, many of them getting
lazy and fat, sitting among historically unprecedented
resources, nursing ridiculous irrational worldviews,
watching dumb soap operas and complaining that the society
doesn't sufficiently motivate them to learn and exercise.

How many of such people do you see in the Third World?

We may mourn a small group of kids who died from the shooting
spree, and forget that the state protection needed [?] to 
decrease chances for such accidents, already make most of
the population rot alive, without being aware of it.
And then these people vote for more protection because they
are scared and lost.

I was recently surprised to learn that hitch-hiking is now
ILLEGAL in the "free" state of New York - and, apparently,
in many other states.  Any other country that has this rule?

Where should we draw the lines of "protection"?

If there is a town where all citizens agree to give guns to
their kids, would the government allow it as an experiment?

    FROM MOUNTAIN MEDIA
    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE DATED MAY 31, 1999
    THE LIBERTARIAN, By Vin Suprynowicz
    To prevent a life of crime, buy your kid a gun

    It's called propaganda: Simplify your lie down to an easily-recalled
slogan, repeat it often enough, and people will eventually get it down by
heart and accept it as fact.

  Take: "The cause of all these school shootings is the too-easy
availability of guns."

  Prior to the National Firearms Act of 1933, there was no law to
discourage a veteran of the Great War from keeping a fully-operational
souvenir machine gun in the bedroom closet. There were few towns in America
where the local lads didn't know the location of at least one such weapon.
Yet none was ever used in a "school shooting."

  As late as the 1960s, it was not unusual in rural America for young boys
to carry their .22 rifles to school with them, parking them in the
principal's office  until needed for the target matches after school. At
age 49 I am no doddering old-timer, but I can remember young lads walking
the country roads of Ohio and Connecticut after school with their rifles
(or bicycling home with the weapons across their handlebars), hoping to
pick off some predatory bird with the full encouragement of area farmers. A
neighbor might chide you about watching where your bullets went if you
missed, but no one ever called the police to report "The Jones boy is
heading down the road with his gun; come arrest him!"

  When I went away to Eaglebrook School in Massachusetts (yes, "Own a gun,
go to jail" Massachusetts) in 1962 at the age of 12, I took my rifle. We
fired for accuracy at the range on Saturdays. I daresay we could have snuck
them out of the lockers down at the gym for some mayhem if it ever crossed
our minds ... but it never did.

  The violent media? Today's TV offers nothing like "The Rifleman" or
"Wanted Dead or Alive," programs of the early 1960s in which Chuck Connors
and Steve McQueen ended every episode by mowing down some reprobate who had
kicked the town dog or insulted Millie down at the general store, in
McQueen's case using a sawed-off Winchester which it's now a federal felony
even to recreate for a museum.

  This focus on "the availability of guns" -- ignoring the fact they were
far more accessible only 40 years ago, when you could order a 20-mm Lahti
anti-tank gun through the mail from an ad in the back of a comic book -- is
intended not only to advance the prior agenda of those who want a disarmed
and enslaved citizenry, but also to distract us from asking what it is
about the mandatory behavior modification labs (public schools) which
creates such rage and frustration in our incarcerated adolescent males. We
don't see these shoot-em-ups in the private schools, or among
home-schoolers.

  It also diverts attention from the perfectly relevant question of how
many of these shooters had been on drugs known to affect the judgment, like
Ritalin and Luvox, (start ital)prescribed and administered by their
government wardens(end ital).

  In the face of all this misdirection, isn't it too bad the government has
never conducted an actual scientific study on how it affects a child's
likelihood of committing crimes if his parents buy him a gun?

  Um, actually ... they have.

  The study was conducted from 1993-1995 by the U.S. Department of
Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. Child
psychologists tracked 4,000 boys and girls aged 6 to 15 in Denver,
Pittsburgh, and Rochester, N.Y. Their findings?

  -- Children who get guns from their parents don't commit gun crimes (0
percent) while children who get guns illegally are quite likely to do so
(21 percent).

  -- Children who get guns from parents are less likely to commit any kind
of street crime (14 percent) than children who have no gun in the house (24
percent) -- and are dramatically less likely to do so than children who
acquire an illegal gun (74 percent.)

  -- Children who get guns from parents are less likely to use banned drugs
(13 percent) than children who get illegal guns (41 percent.)

  -- Most strikingly, the study found: "Boys who own legal firearms have
much lower rates of delinquency and drug use (than boys who own illegal
guns) and are even slightly less delinquent than non-owners of guns."

  This wouldn't have surprised anyone before the rise of the modern welfare
state. It used to be common knowledge that the best way to get kids to act
"responsibly" was precisely to give them some "responsibility." Why would
we assume a child taught by his parents to use a gun responsibly wouldn't
also be more responsible in his other behaviors?

  "Want to dramatically reduce the chance that your child will commit a
gun-related crime or -- heaven forbid -- go on a shooting spree?" asked the
national Libertarian Party in a May 21 news release detailing these study
results. "Buy your youngster a gun."

  "Politicians are apparently more interested in demonizing guns than they
are in facts," commented LP national director Steve Dasbach, himself an
Indiana government schoolteacher.  But "The evidence is in: The simplest
way to reduce firearm-related violence among children is to buy them a gun
and teach them how to use it responsibly."

Review-Journal, is author of the book, "Send in the Waco Killers: Essays on

Vin Suprynowicz,   vin@lvrj.com

The evils of tyranny are rarely seen but by him who resists it. -- John
Hay, 1872

The most difficult struggle of all is the one within ourselves. Let us not
get accustomed and adjusted to these conditions. The one who adjusts ceases
to discriminate between good and evil.  He becomes a slave in body and
soul. Whatever may happen to you, remember always: Don't adjust! Revolt
against the reality! -- Mordechai Anielewicz, Warsaw, 1943

Interesting how so many superheroes gained their powers in some kind of
accident that would probably be repeatable.  For example, Peter Parker
was working with nuclear material and there was an accident that
combined him with a spider, right?  Well, couldn't that be reproduced? 
It's a classic serendipitous discovery, like finding out that the mold
growing on your petri dishes kills bacteria.  It should be possible to
figure out the methodology that could make everyone who wanted to be a
SpiderTransHuman.

On something of a tangent, does anyone has any idea what the mythic
justification for all the secret identities is?  Why is it so important
that nobody know that Clark Kent is Superman?  Why is this such a
universal feature of superhero myths?

As many on this list know...I'm a trucker.

Many truckers call the Northeast the "communist" states...some...such as

Gun Policy in the Aftermath of Littleton

by Doug Bandow

Doug Bandow is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute.

We live in an age of paradox. Media saturation following events like the
murders at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., makes it appear that
violence surrounds us. Yet the crime rate has been falling and school
shootings remain extremely rare. In contrast, the serious violence that
pervades some inner-city schools never makes the news.

Moreover, tragedies like Columbine almost always launch a spate of
counterproductive policy initiatives. Such as gun control. Although
inadequate morals rather than laws led to the Columbine murders, activists,
interest groups and politicians immediately dusted off their old proposals
to launch anew.

The temptation to ban Þrearms is understandable. Anything seems reasonable
in an attempt to save even a few people who die by bullets every year.

Yet private possession of weapons does not automatically lead to their
misuse: heavily armed societies like Israel and Switzerland have only a
fraction of our violent crime. Anyway, it is too late to try to disarm a
society where 240 million guns are in private hands.

Nor is disarmament a reasonable goal. It is easy to belittle the use of
Þrearms for hunting or target shooting, yet the right to engage in such
activities is the bedrock of a free society. Sportsmen rarely misuse their
weapons; those who don't should not be punished for the sins of the few who
do.

Using guns for self-defense is even more important. There is no more
fundamental right, especially in a world in which the police offer only
imperfect protection, at best. John Lott of the University of Chicago
Þgures that guns are used Þve times as often to prevent as to commit crimes.

Nor should one desire a world in which only state ofÞcials possess weapons.
Although a standing Army has replaced the militia as America's main defense
against foreign foes, the nation's Founders rightly distrusted giving
government a monopoly on deadly force. Tyranny may seem exceedingly
unlikely, but disarming average citizens makes it more rather than less
likely to occur.

Nevertheless, as predictable as the tides, Columbine led to a new campaign
to regulate Þrearms. Proposals include background checks at gun shows,
trigger locks, limits on the number of guns that can be purchased, a ban on
concealable Þrearms and increasing the legal age to buy Þrearms. Even some
past critics of gun controls have þipped in the face of the public
relations onslaught.

None of these proposals would have stopped the Columbine massacre, however.
As Lott points out, the killers ''violated at least 17 state and federal
weapons-control laws.'' A couple more on the books would have made no
difference.

But new rules could make crime more likely by disarming potential victims
and citizen cops. Research by Lott suggests that allowing people to carry
concealed weapons lowers the violent crime rate. Those who get a permit
from the local sheriff or police chief aren't likely to knock over the
local convenience store. However, they might prevent someone else from
knocking it over, and the bad guys know it.

Indeed, private individuals with guns - one a vice principal, the other a
banquet hall owner - ended two recent school shootings.

Massad Ayoob, head of the Lethal Force Institute, which trains police and
military personnel, observes: "Previously unthinkable dangers can sometimes
only be neutralized by previously unthinkable defenses.''

There is no evidence that waiting periods lower crime rates. Such
restrictions do, however, prevent people from buying a gun to protect
themselves from imminent danger. Nor should adults between 18 and 21 be
denied Þrearms, as if they were uniquely dangerous.

Trigger locks would save few lives a minuscule number of children die in
gun accidents, less than in many mundane household tragedies but would
hinder people from defending themselves. Individual owners can best balance
the one risk against the other.

Licensed dealers already must conduct background checks, including at gun
shows. Private individuals need not, but there is no evidence that
potential criminals þock to these very public gatherings to consummate
illegal deals.

There already are 20,000 different laws covering the purchase and use of
Þrearms. Criminals routinely violate one or more of these restrictions to
acquire a weapon. They aren't likely to hesitate breaking another one or
two. New controls and regulations would most burden the law-abiding.

The most potent response to gun crimes is to punish the criminal. Use of a
Þrearm should automatically increase one's sentence. Those who sell guns to
criminals or juveniles should be likewise punished. Existing laws should be
rigorously enforced.

Legislators should, however, pause before passing any new measures.
Tragedies like Columbine too often trigger policy-making by emotion. In
this case seeking to ''just do something'' is worse than doing nothing. It
is likely to make us all less safe.

One would probably need a similar permit as for the air taser, and
of course the countries that don't allow stun guns, like good ol'
Holland and Britain, certainly wouldn't allow this thing --  the very
idea that private citizens could effectively defend themselves gives
those govs (and a good portion of the sheepish public) the shivers.
But hey, screw 'em all!

Yes, me too. Boyohboyohboy, just think of all the tactical (&fun)
possibilities one would have with this gun. Due to the non-lethal
option, lack of incriminating traces (spent casings, bullets etc.)
and (afaik) the nice side-effect of some short-term memory loss
in the victim, you can go and zap anyone who bothers you, and
get away with it. And what to think of a new, ultra-realistic, "phaser
game" to replace paint ball and those lame laser games?

Should somebody help him collect money
> for a prototype?  sounds like a good investment.

A good investment indeed. It may not be the "ideal" weapon, but
it's damn close. This should sell like crazy. Any ideas on how
one, not having much money, could still get involved and profit
from this development? If this isn't a golden opportunity, nothing
is.

Donald J. Sobol wrote the Encyclopedia Brown books.

Also good in the same vein is "The Mad Scientist's Club" by Bertrand
Brinley.

Of course, there are Heinlein's juveniles.  In addition to being just
plain fun to read, they seamlessly convey an amazing amount of ideas,
and a lot of solid hard SF speculation.  These are wonderful for adults
as well; if you don't like the later Heinlein, you might want to give
these a try.  I like "The Rolling Stones" and "Citizen of the Galaxy"
especially.

"The War Between the Pitiful Teachers and the Splendid Kids" by Stanley
Kiesel is a hilarious and damning parody of the public schools, written
at about the sixth grade level.  I recommend getting it to any child of
your acquaintance who is stuck in the public schools.

Going through my collection of kids' books, I was surprised how few
science fiction books there were; however, there are a great many
stories about talking animals, objects that convey mystical power,
magical other lands, etc.  I'm pretty sure that reading such tales is
part of my attraction to really far out tech; in my lifetime, I may
actually see a talking cat made of glass, or a man who can leap tall
buildings in a single bound.

Hello all. My studies are going well in part thanks to many on the list who 
saw fit to download some of their knowledge to me.  Thanks again.

I've been spending a lot of brain cycles lately considering how advent of 
molecular nanotechnology might play out on the world scene.  Sifting through 
the list archives and the Internet has been helpful but not completely 
gratifying. I'm familiar with many of the books that portray nanotech such 
as Bear's Queen of Angels and Slant.

How will the announcement of the development of a fully functional molecular 
assembler affect the world? What about the impact over time?  For example, 
if MNT represents the year an assembler is developed what will the world be 
like at MNT+1, MNT+10, MNT+100? I know this is all speculative but it seems 
to me that we should be able to make some intelligent speculations about 
such a future.

Here's a bunch of questions I'm currently wrestling with:

Will the widespread hype begin before or after the development of an 
Assembler?  Will the public be informed about the capabilities of an 
Assembler prior to its development or only afterwards?

Who has the best chance of developing the first Assembler? the U.S. 
government? another government? coalitions? corporations? conglomerates? the 
nanotech Galileo tinkering in vis lab?

How will the nature of the first developer affect how events progress in the 
MNT+x era?  Will it matter who the first developer is because governments 
will seize the technology?

Will the financial markets act similar to Hanson's idea futures market and 
begin factoring in the eminent development of the Assembler into its 
valuations? This assumes that the finance types identify what affects such 
an event would have on valuations.

What will the economic impact be? Will pre-MNT capital lose all its value? 
What will be the commodity of the post-MNT era? The most obvious answer is 
'the ability to make Assemblers'. But what about creativity, Assembler 
software, Assembler software debugging software, easily mutable materials, 
heat dissipation technology, etc.?

Should Assembler software be open source? Does it matter if Assembler 
software is efficient? What weight should be given to the 'crazy screw with 
a problem' factor where the screw decides to implement some "goo" scenario?

What would be the motivation of a 'crazy screw' since many ailments that 
drive 'fanatics' will be remedied or have the potential to be remedied with 
MNT?

What is the future of governments in the MNT+x era?

What platform is MNT/OS likely to be based upon?

Chandra Patel

Spiderman is a really cool cat.  He was a chemist before he was bitten
by the radioactive spider, from whence he derived his spidey strength.
He did the web slinging based purely on technology: he invented the
stuff himself.  Furthermore, he had all the 20 something angst of a normal
guy: couldnt find the right woman, kept picking the losers, etc. {8^D
In retrospect, he might be as cool as Batman.  spike

I think it's for security reasons. The antagonist of the hero might have
easier access to Superman as Clark Kent, with his superpowers set aside?

     I think it may be a privacy issue, after all if they were to know who 
Clark Kent really was he would constantly be plagued with people wanting 
autographs, asking him to bend stuff, taking pictures with the kids....Who 
needs that?  Also I believe it adds mystique' to the character and allows 
room for character exploration.

I respond:
It's plausable that some groups will not support nanotechnology. Just as in
the current real time, we have examples of resistance towards advanced
technologies. This angle usually lies within ethics and morality. However,
eventually I forsee most people will own a microwave sized assembler in
their home, for family food distribution etc. Much like the t.v. and cars
evolved into most housholds.

You wrote:
>Will the widespread hype begin before or after the development of an

I respond:
As you are well aware, the public is not well informed about this issue as
it is. Depending on how policy will work alongside of nano's progress will
effect these public information questions. Most likely, the mainstream will
see nanotech products as the evolve and not before. They will read about
some neat new nano gadget in the news and utilize it,  still unaware of the
eventual possibilities until they arrive.

I repond:
Good question, one without a real answer. We would like to assume it would
be some safe measure area.(and here in the states) Other countries are also
working on this development. And there also is the reality that some
teeenage Joe Blow with some equiptment in his basement could twidle around
some nanobots, go to bed, and the next morning the stuff is climbing over
the backyard fence, creeping into your house! Right now, Universities are
making progress (ei. Nadrian Seeman at NYU). The government has a lot of
funding going out to these type of institutions, but their goal is on a
smaller product nano, or weapons.

This is important, how will we regulate nanotechnology?Do we want the
government to come in and decide it's no good? (I don't) Do want to set up
our own guidlines or use some predesignated group? Will the government just
snatch it up anyways, or will it be to late for them to by the time it's
full blown?

I respond:
People have different ideas on the results of nanotech on our economy. Some
think cash flow will remain prevelant, be it for familiarity, gambling,
fun, or stable ownership deeds like land. (stuff that inspite of a drop of
financial interest will always be around and will still need some kind of
trade commodity) I personally, (although with things like future
predictions, one can be wrong!) think that money will become pretty
obsolete, maybe your Uncle Dick will save silver dollars as a hobby. But for
all general purposes, everything we need will be taken care of. (this
doesn't include the land issue-or how we will purchase these enduring
things, maybe a new system? Barter like our ancestors did) We will have our
own personal manufactures to meet our needs. As far as your question of
creativity, there  may be those that seperate. (this is my theory some will
live the old way,-where cash may still flow-or some will happily adapt to
the new way)  Some people will want to continue to work, for a sense of self
accomplishment, to curb boredom or for other reasons that people may not
accept these new ways. There will be all kinds of VR ways to feel creative,
and still yet the old make your own chair way too.

I respond:
All these questions are a matter of security. Assembler's will have to be
processed in a sealed lab,
someone cannot open the lab with out destroying the contents and no
assembler can escape from within. Software will be running from a large
nanoelectronic computer running advanced molecular simulations software.
Beyond the layers of wires (that carry power and signals), sensors(several
layers of these detectors), stressed diamond composite, thermal insulators,
microscope, electrical igniters, are surrounded by the actual sealed
assembler lab. The goal here is, that it is efficient.

Well, in fairness, guys, Extropianism, is also about the 
sociological/political IMPLICATIONS of "ultra-technology", not just 
"Ultra-technology" itself.

How long is this to go on? Don't you people realize that you are
causing people to unsubscribe, due to sheer post volume?

Unfortunately there is no unsubscription feedback, otherwise you'd see 
you're killing the list. Didn't you notice? It never fully
recovers. Negative selection: the best people don't come back. See
archives for proof.

Please take this off-list. NOW.

And let's declare future gun debates off limits.

>Bad news Rick, you can add me to that category, until the second
>amendment is repealed, nobody is taking my guns, period.


Even if it means shooting a police officer following the orders of his
supervisor?  If you answer no to that then you are completely countering
your own point. Is you precious little gun(s) worth someones life?  If you
think so then you must be wacked - no other reason.  (No offense intended).

>Not paranoid in the slightest, pragmatic. I have the right to
>protect myself, and will do so, period.

My original point was how a guy was willing to kill innocents doing their
job rather than hand over the guns. How the hell are you protecting
yourself. Do you have to hide behind your guns with all your problems? Does
that mean if someone hassles you you are willing to shoot them?  Frankly,
unless someone comes at you with a gun of their own and you shoot then you
are nothing but a potential murderer.

>If you do not wish to own a gun and be responsible for your own
>protection, that is your choice, but you do not have the right to
>make that choice for me.

Bullshit, sorry dOOd.  Face to face unarmed I could most likely whoop your
ass to hell. Since I'd rather learn how to do that than rely on a small
projectile that is most likely going to cause death. I don't need to hide
behind a gun unless I'm being shot at myself. Like I've stated before, there
are other ways of protecting yourself other than branding a gun so freely.
And for your information - I was not making that choice for you, I was
stating an opinion.

>Alarms rarely stop anything but the simplest burglars, sniping the
>phone line (easily accessible) renders most useless.

Sorry, I forgot, you must be in the US, in most other countries they
actually have internal and inaccessable phone lines that every joe schmoe
can't access so easily.  If you invest in a good alarm system, then they can
be very effective. Don't talk like guns are the only way of protecting
yourself for sure, try spending more time on stopping people getting in
rather than looking to shoot someone who can enter easily.

>The police? Fine if that's what you want, and they happen to be
>available, of course they're not responsible if anything happens to
>you.

That is a true statement and I agree with you. I guess this point depends on
the efficiency of the police in certain peoples area.  Again however, there
are other ways of protecting yourself other than going straight for a gun.
Prevention and protection is the best cure, by which I mean more focus
should be spent on stopping someone getting into your house than flooring
someone AFTER they are in your house.

I am talking a lot about home protection I know because thats the issue I'm
referring to. Other than sports, most people quite simply don't NEED a gun
on them all the time, unless you're paranoid that someone is after you.
Unless of course, you're an armed robber, now THAT is understandable ;)

>The second amendment was written long after the earth cooled, and

>start by repealing the second amendment.

Screw the constitution. Its ridiculous.  Why do people in the US always
dictate the constitution, does no one ever put common sense before their so
called 'rights'?  I'm not trying to start an international slagging match
here, I'm just asking a legitimate question.  Forget about the right for the
moment, just because the right exists, it does not mean you have to cover it
with a comb. If a police unit comes to your house with a genuine reason (in
their eyes) to revoke your weapons, and you are willing to shoot them just
because of an apparent right to do so then one is a potential murder, no
matter how decent a person one is. No right is worth killing an innocent
doing their job. Anyone who thinks otherwise should get their priorities
straight.

>In all the recent incidences, numerous gun laws were broken,
>passing more won't stop them.

No, but trying to stem the free-flow of them could help in the future.

>It's interesting that the anti-gunners keep ignoring the fact that

>prescription mind altering drugs.

Also note, I'm not an ANTI-gunner. Not at all, I'm debating the state of
mind behind the debate of 'guns are ok', 'I'd rather kill than have my guns
taken away'.  A gun does NOT represent freedom. At all!  The only thing a
gun represents in the way of freedom is the murder of those that threaten to
take away the freedom of carrying a killing tool (and in this day and age
that means a legal notice that you are not fit to carry a gun). This is not
100AD (when most US phone lines were apparently installed - j/k), people
should focus more on what freedom they have than what they would do if
anyone tried to take away their gun.  What if?  Well I'd   ...   What if?
Well I'd   ...   What if?    Well I'd?

>The second amendment has nothing to do with sport hunting.

No but the issue is guns. Locate the connection.

>We will fight to stop any new violations of the second amendment.

Fair enough.  One thing that would lighten my opinion of the NRA is if they
were at least willing to compromise instead of getting all defensive. There
is a hell of a lot more at stake than the simple right to bear arms.  As I
mentioned above, I am not against guns when used correctly, I am merely
expressing MY opinion on how many people 'opposed to new laws' sound more
wacko and care-free 'trigger wild' than a human life is worth.

Someone else said that they WOULD stop officers taking away their guns
because THAT would violate THEIR right.  That is wacked.  Listen, think
about it.  Why not let the officers take away the guns and then file a
lawsuit stating that your rights were violated. That way you don't end up
dead (because that is what would happen in a shootout with the police).

There is always two sides to every story and the best side will always
prevail in this debate if people would just take a minute to consult their
priorities and common sense.  Frankly, it disgusts me to hear how so many
are willing to open fire and ruin innocent familities all for a silly right
that can be flexible. Have so many people lost it that they don't think of
the consequences of such potential acts?  Hell, its clear now to the rest of
the world why so many high school kids can so easily act like serial
killers.

Isn't it strange, that the good and surprising stuff grows scarcer and 
scarcer as you approach the recent entries? Perhaps we should have more
such fascinating discussions as recently. That will take care of the
rest of it. Then we all can unsubscribe, and have a nice little lobotomy.

There's no mandatory schooling in most of them (at least not for

ay?  And with all their "friends" armed, too!).  They kill and are 
killed by their foes in war or banditry, and not in schoolhouse halls.

They have less learning and maturing to do to grow into less 
technologically advanced societies, and are usually brainwashed 
into some fundamentalism or other, which makes them fear for 
their mortal souls to kill those whom they call "us", and at the 
same time strive to improve their eventual position in paradise by 
offing as many of the ones identified as "them" as possible.

You'd have a hard time finding a town where all citizens would 
agree to give guns to all their kids, including all races sexes,

But several are killed, which would not be the case if NO kids had

The cost would be several orders of magnitude more than a metal

I think a lot of people would get shot.  How many kids out there 
would do what Harris and Klebold did if they could, but just can't 
get their hands on the gund to do it with?  If you hand them the 
guns, nothing is stopping them any more; certainly not the fear of 
death, which is irrelevant to kids who have already decided to "go 
out in a blaze of glory" as Harris put it in his letter, and embark on 
a bloody homicide/suicide mission in which they vow that they will 
"never be taken alive."

My design was built from two Super Soaker water guns mounted on a common
trigger. We powered the 'beams' with 30 kV pulsed DC - similar to a
standard stun gun. At the best range I got, I was able to reliably light a
neon lamp at three feet before the streams began to lose 'coherency' and
break into droplets. Pretty wimpy.

Another outfit - Jaycor - (they're on the web) has patented a 'water
cannon' that uses a single stream - that's why I stopped development, aside
from the range problem. They also show a person with a GROUNDED SHOE firing
a single stream - that would have been educational if the shooter lifted
that foot while firing...

I have a feeling this particular device will either turn out to be
unworkable, or will be relegated to the same fate as the laser blinding
weapons developed a few years back by the military. Or perhaps this can be
useful in any totalitarian government's bag of tricks - we know who they
are...

It's been illegal in just about every state I know of, probably since the
Depression when people could only travel long distances by hitchhiking or
jumping a train...can't have those rabble-rousers getting around freely,
now can we?

At the point where it interferes with personal liberty.

The Federal government has no say in this, according to the Constitution,
but I would not put it past them to interfere. Look what happened with
medical maryjane in California...

A small town down south (Georgia?) about ten or fifteen years ago passed a
law requiring all able citizens to buy and maintain a firearm - this was in
reaction to some gun legislation at the time. I don't know what ultimately
happened there, though.

Apropos bandwidth... Lucent Bell Labs said on Netword+Interop in Las

drawer. Pluris has a TBit router with a 184 TBps optical
backplane. Specs for TBit Ethernet are purportedly also in the works.

There are extreme antigun voices and extreme progun voices, just 
like ther are extreme antiabortion voices and extreme prochoice 
voices, and then there's the sensible center, where I reside on this 
issue.  To further draw the parallel, both extreme antiabortion and 
extreme progun voices (the two "civil rights" issues of the 
conservative right) assume an absolute position (no abortion, even 
one minute after conception; no gun restriction, even for the insane, 
underage or criminally violent) and warn, using the same flawed 
analogies from the same historical precedents (typically naziism 
and antebellum slavery in the american south) to argue, by means 
of slippery slopes and dominoes, of losses of personal freedom of 
biblical proportions if their absolutistic standard is compromised 
one iota.  On the other side, both extreme prochoice and extreme 
antigun voices do much the same thing, and draw similar, and 
similarly flawed analogies, to argue in defence of an unrestricted 
right to partial-birth abortion for any reason or for none, or the 
banning of all guns for all citizens and the elimination of sport 
hunting.  My position is kinda like Roe vs. Wade, in which the right 
to abortion is connected to the level of development of the fetus.  
No restrictions are permitted in the first trimester, some in the 
second, and a lot in the third.  For me, the right to keep and bear 
arms should be connected to the level of personal responsibility 
demonstrated by each individual.  Any responsible adult should be 
able to purchase firearms.  The names of those who do not meet 
the criteria of responsibility (who have been convicted of violent 
criminal offences, spouse and/or child abuse, or judged mentally 
unfit by a legitimate psychiatric review) should be kept in a national 
purchase-prohibited registry, AND NO OTHER NAMES.  If you can 
prove (say, with your birth certificate) that you are of age (18 
seems reasonable to me) and your name does not appear on the 
registry, your purchase should go through.  These registries should 
apply to, and be accessible by, gun dealers, gun shows, pawn 
shop owners, flea market owners, and any other place where 
weapons may be reasonably expected to be purchased by people 
unknown to the seller.  Those who knowingly sell a firearm to 
someone on the prohibited registry should be prosecuted for the 
sale, and held legally liable for any gun-related crime the buyer 
subsequently commits.  Those who have these matters pending or 
proceeding in court should have their names provisionally added to 
the registry, to be removed upon acquittal or judgment of mental 
fitness.  All decisions should be appealable, but the names should 
remain on the list until the appeals are decided.  Trigger locks 
should be required to be sold with every firearm, and if a shooting 
subsequently occurs where the shooter has taken the weapon from 
the owner without consent and the lock was not installed, the 
owner should be held liable for neglect.  If the trigger lock was in 
place but subsequently picked or broken off, the owner should not 
be held liable.

Interesting aside on the sword/gus scene in Temple of Doom, it was
originally supposed to be a sword/bullwhilp fight but Harrison Ford was
half dead with Montezuma's revenge and they re-wrote it to be easier on
him.
Must agree though I laughed my ass off.

When I said that a person who knowingly sold someone on a 
prohibited purchase list a gun should be both prosecuted for the 
offence of the sale and liable for the purchaser's subsequent gun-
related crimes, I of course meant only those crimes perpetrated 
with the aid of the illicitly purchased weapon.

Third world parents can afford to send their children to school for
a long time, where they are effectively segrated from adults.
Third world children have to deal with people of all ages, all day
long. And that has a stabalizing influence on them.

        "Me too" posts are almost always a waste of bandwidth, but given
the situation I must say: "Me too!"

        I remember posting a few months ago my views on keeping the list
open, for the sake of any signal...but this is ridiculous.  I can't even
rely on the subject headings any more to indicate the quality of the posts.
 So little signal gets through that I wonder if it is truly worth sifting
through the heaps of garbage just to find it.  Maybe the conferences will
have to be enough to keep my interests peaked.

Thats a tough thought though... has any work been done towards
designs for compound eukaryote-drexler nanotech entities?
Would it be possible to design 'stealth' nanites able to live
inside cells and suck up ATP for power? Would cyborg-amoebae  
have any advantages over 'conventional' nanotech?

Hmmmm.  Steve.

Single-celled organisms often use shells, called tests, for defense.
Presumably a new kind of test could be quite useful, as could a
microscopic can opener.  Silica is great but carborundum would
be better.

A cyborg osteoblast could make your bones out of a different material
which I assume could be quite handy if you could find the right replacement
material.  

A cyborg macrophage could mechanically dispose of nonreactive
substances like asbestos.  Chop it up, put it in small wrapped
bundles, and put it in some secretion.  This could be particularly
handy for lungs.

Cells use a lot of microscopic motors for a host of functions (moving
stuff around, going places)  A motor with a greater power efficiency
would be a real help.

Of course, drextech is currently designed on the assumption it operates
in a vacuum free of ionizing radiation.  I understand an aqueous 
environment full of reactive substances would be pretty hostile to drextech.

	im not sure who to send this to exactly, so im sending it to 
everybody; sorry bout the use of bandwidth: so how doable would it be to set 
up a subscription feedback system, that, say, could be an optional part of 
subscribing to the list (maybe a footer or something equally unobtrusive), 
and of course would be completly anonymous? would there be any reason not to 
set up something like that, if it could be done fairly easily?

The curious thing is how deterministic this phenomenon is. From time
to time, guns come up, a flamewar ensues and then lots of threads crop
up about list quality. After a while it all peters out, list quality
goes up for a few months, and then the next flamewar begins. Not
unlike the quiescent - activated - refractive - quiescent cycle of
chemical clocks. It has been going on here for years, and I guess it
is endemic to many lists with sufficiently high volume.

This is of course my pet peevee with superhero stories - they
completely forget that practically everything is replicable, so if you
can make one superhero with the superserum, then you can make
hundreds. Even if the original invention is lost, others can replicate
it - especially since they now know it is possible.

Story-wise, it is of course a good thing only to have individual
superheroes and villains, otherwise things would turn too strange. But
it would be fun to really write a "superhero" story where these powers
were becoming more and more common, and parents might start thinking
about going to enhancement centers for their children (wouldn't *you*
want your child to be nearly indestructible?), and all the social
effects of this.

I liked to think that - until many of the people I voted for decided to
change their positions after election. How can we ensure that campaign
promises and platform positions are not modified once the electee finds out
where the money for reelection is coming from?

Oh, yes - my old home town of Morton Grove. They had something like one
shooting in ten years. Oak Park followed suit, also banning private
ownership of nuclear devices, even such inoffensive things like breeder
reactors and power plants. They have signs on the city limits declaring Oak
Park a 'nuclear free' zone - got to wonder if that includes radiation
therapy and food sterilization. 

So far, I have not witnessed any reports of gross increases in crime in
either city, but Oak Park borders on the west side of Chicago, which is not
the safest place in the world. Perhaps the media does not want to point out
the downside of the laws...

As I recall, there is a single gene on the Y-chromosome that starts
the differentiation process to a male; if it is missing then XY will
produce a female phenotype. Ah, here is what I found at
http://darwin.biology.queensu.ca/courses/bio210/L3.html

    1.The SRY Gene

-short arm of the Y chromosome contains about 10 million base pairs
(10,000 kb); only possible to isolate and characterize maybe 50 or 100
of these
-by 1986 using "positional cloning" techniques researchers had
isolated TDF to upper part of short arm of Y
-David Page et al at MIT; patients from infertility clinics (no sperm)
-used males, genetically XX with a tiny piece of short arm of Y
translocated onto one of X chromosomes
-1987 first located in 300 kb region, by recombinant DNA techniques
followed by probing, a gene called ZFY (loops of amino acid chains
held together with zinc ions)
-detected male-specific fragment in all mammals investigated and was
highly conserved BUT quickly found that some XX men with normal testes
(though sterile) lacking ZFY THUS ZFY NOT the TDF
-1990 Goodfellow et al then selected 4 XX male patients with tiniest
fractions of Y (35 kb region) and screened for possible gene sequences
-found only one sequence specific to males, and conserved in other species
-named SRY (sex determining region) of Y chromosome
In support of this claim:
1) several XY patients who are female have mutations in the SRY region
2) mutant line of mice with XY females has deletion of corresponding Sry gene
3) Experiment
-take fertilized mouse embryos, mixture of XX and XY, inject with many
copies of cloned and purified mouse Sry gene
-implant embryos back in mums
-gene will be incorporated into genome and expressed in some but not
all baby mice
-produced 2 XX male mice, these were Sry transgenic but also sterile
(because lacked other missing Y genes) THUS Sry gene is both necessary
and sufficient to produce male body type in humans and mice

F How SRY Works

1994 used cloned Sry gene as a probe to detect location in body tissue
of Sry messenger RNA
-found gene active only in testis
-used PCR to determine when active - Sry m RNA detected 10.5 - 11.5
days after fertilization
Model
Human SRY: gene codes for protein product which binds to a specific
target sequence in the DNA and holds it open in a loop, which could
either shut down or open up a whole region of DNA for transcription
-1996: PERHAPS the SRY gene acts not by turning on male-determining
genes, but by turning off female-determining ones (ongoing research)


So if you put SRY into XX, you will get a sterile male (since the
original question was the origin of Anakin, I think we can safely say
this was not the method in this case due to the existence of the twins
:-)

The problem would be to get a compatible clone body in any case; while
the overall design is similar for all humans, individual differences
are noticeable and would likely appear when you grow a brainless clone
body; the sex difference jusrt complicates things a bit more.

Familiarity breeds contempt ? It might be interesting to mod
the list software to completely strip all identifying marks
from posts so that you couldn't tell who wrote them.

Seriously, it seems the only solution is to keep the size
down... if it gets big enough, break it up into multiple
lists.

Please can list members have some sympathy for us poor Brits, and others
around the world, who have not seen it yet. We have to wait until July
(16th/ 17th I think), and - unlike some obsessives I know - I have so far
managed to avoid learning the entire plot of the film.

I suppose I can't object to discussions of the technology, but please try

Sorry to be a pain, and I appreciate you actually having the courtesy to ask

I haven't even seen the Matrix yet, but I've only got another week, maybe

Sounds like a rework of the Brady Bill and recent Illinois legislation. Why
would anyone object to this?

The Brady bills' original three day waiting (cooloff) period seems to be
just an annoyance to legitimate purchasers, and will probably result in
injury or death to people who otherwise may have been able to defend
themselves. Lawmakers are pressing to reinstate it even in the presence of
the electronic registry.

I especially would like to see the liability waiver for trigger locks added
to present legislation - how the courts can apply negligence penalties to
someone who obviously took care to secure a dangerous item is beyond me.

How do you feel about proposed limits on quantity purchases? I don't like
the idea of govt. telling me how many of an item I can buy - but again
can't see any legitimate reason for someone to need to buy more than one
gun at a time. A truly rabid collector who just came into lots of money,
maybe?

UNCONVENTIONAL WISDOM: New facts and hot stats from the social sciences
Guns and Gun Massacres: A Contrary View  By Richard Morin

Sunday, May 30, 1999; Page B05

Talk about timing.

A month after the massacre in Littleton, Colo., and not even a week after six
students were shot at a Georgia high school, economist John R. Lott Jr. of the
University of Chicago appeared at a conference to argue that there are good
reasons for more people to have more guns.

Specifically, Lott and colleague William M. Landes, a law school professor at
Chicago, say their research has led them to conclude that allowing people to
carry concealed weapons dramatically reduces the occurrence and the
severity of multiple-victim shootings.

Most experts find those assertions counterintuitive. Some dismiss them as
ridiculous. As you might expect, gun advocates embrace Lott and Landes's
findings, and gun opponents pillory them. In reply, Lott says: "Just look at
the evidence"--which is exactly what his doubters and critics say they're
doing.

Lott and Landes base their claims on a statistical analysis of multiple-victim
shootings that occurred between 1977 and 1995 in the United States. They
focused on shootings in public places "where the point of the attack was to
produce carnage," Lott told a conference at the American Enterprise Institute
here.

Dear Dr. Kent,

I apear to have been invited into this discussion by Matthew Gaylor.  If you're
not familiar with my books and other writings on  firearms-related issues,
you're
probably not going to accept that I know more about this subject than you
do. But
I do and you should.

The criminological research proving that guns are much more frequent in
stopping
criminal invasions and tragic consequences than in enabling such is so
indisputable to anyone who isn't dishonest or operating on a hidden agenda
as to
make your opening assertions a billboard that you haven't done your homework.

I've given up debating this issue; it's too wearing. I write books then
move on to
other topics so I don't have to endlessly rehash the same subjects.

If you actually give a damn about the truth about guns, I recommend that you
consult my book Stopping Power: Why 70 Million Americans Own Guns. You can
buy the
new paperback edition on Amazon.com. There's a reading list at the end of
my book,
in case my book leaves you unsatisfied.

Otherwise, understand that by making unsupported assertions about a subject you
haven't spent any time researching will only discredit your scholarly
abilities in
the minds of anyone who has.

Sincerely,

J. Neil Schulman.

"John R. Lott, Jr." <john_lott@law.uchicago.edu> responds:
This is incorrect.  1) Only a small number of murders involve people who
are emotionally close to each other.  The normal claim about acquaintance
murders fails to note that most "acquaintances" are rival gang members or
drug dealers or others that we would normally not classify as emotionally
close.  Chicago is the only city that breaks down this data in detail and
from 1990 to 1997 14 percent of their murders involved family, friends,
neighbors, or roommates.  2) Unintentional deaths in the home that result
from mistakenly shooting someone who is thought to be an intruder accounts
for about 30 deaths a year.

"John R. Lott, Jr." <john_lott@law.uchicago.edu> responds:
Children under age 5 had 30 accidental gun deaths in 1996.
Children under age 15 had 200.
Given that there are 80 million people owning around 200 to 240 million
guns, can you name another product that is as common around the home that
is anywhere near as dangerous that has as low of an accidental death rate?
More children under 5 die from drowning in water buckets.
The ultimate issue however is one of trade-offs.  Children's lives are also
saved by parents and other adults being able to defend the children with
guns.  There are tens of thousands of defensive uses involving children
each year.  If you would like a more detailed discussion please see my book.

Yes, this would likely work. But it has many drawbacks, since the
activity on a list is self-supporting: if there is a lull for some
time, it tends to persist since people are not cued by postings to
post themselves. Having a large, active and fairly stable list is
something relatively rare; a set of smaller extropians1, extropians2,
... extropians n lists would likely lead to less production of
exformation even if the number of flamewars would be much lower.

I'm a little confused as to why it's such a big deal.  I think I'm
probably the least technically savvy person on the entire list, but I
figured out how to kill all the gun messages before I even saw them.  It
took me less than 30 seconds.  (If you're having trouble doing this in
Netscape, write me.)

I wonder if it's a difference in how people approach the list.  To me,
the list is like a party, with different conversations going on in every
room. In one room, brilliant scientists are talking about the ins and
outs of nanotechnology; in another, people are discussing a news article
about telomere shortening in Dolly, the cloned sheep; and in another
room, people are having a loud, angry debate about gun control.

The loud, angry gun control debate does seem a little out of place at
this party, but it's easy enough for me to go to the next room.  In real
life, I would avoid people who call each other names in the context of a
debate; here, that is even easier.  <plonk>

I wonder if the people getting upset see the list more as a conversation
between a small group of friends, and they would feel rude if they don't
listen to what everyone has to say.  Therefore, they find it rude of the
debaters to talk endlessly about something that the others don't want to
discuss.

Or else they see the list as a formal discussion group, with rules that
are being broken.  If, in real life, you go once a week to a group
discussion on advanced technology, it would be a totally inappropriate
use of that time if people started talking about guns, and against the
rules of the group.

People with a "party" metaphor can be satisfied with aggresive
killfiling.  Perhaps for people who prefer a formal discussion group,
with chartered rules, we could implement a system of required Meta tags
in the subject header, and all of the guns/property rights/etc postings
could have "CONTROVERSIAL:" in their subject heading, as in,
"CONTROVERSIAL: I still think you are a Communist idiot, and gun
statistics." This would allow the loud people to have their say, without
seriously inconveniencing the rest of us, as it makes killfiling
seamless.

For people who see the list as a conversation between friends, however,
the only solution I can see is to create a separate list like
"Extropians Meta" and whenever anything gets out of hand, demand that it
be sent over there.

I do think we may need a formal, procedural solution, as politely asking
people to stop seems to have no effect.

It is likely easier than to have them swim around in the bloodstream
or elsewhere - a well defined chemical environment (maybe a bit
reactive) with no immune systems attacking them. The nanochondria
could be powered by modified ATPases.

The trick is the material; you don't want anything too brittle. You
might also want to have osteoclasts that can break it down. Don't
forget that the bones are important calcium reserves.

Yes, but bio-inspired nanodevices would be right at home. It is wet,
sloppy and random, but has a good infrastructure. The only problem
might be that protein-based nanodevices could produce a HLA signal to
the immune system.

Thanks Elizabeth.  Your post nearly sums up my view.  If we have discipline
with the subject line, all posts should be allowed.  spike

Anders observes that flamewars run in all-too-predictable cycles and asks:

We might first want to ask whether or not the phenomenon serves important, if 
somewhat unexplored, ends.  Consider the analogy with various other cycles 
arising in natural systems, such as the flux in parasite/host ratios.  
Parasites are pesky, no doubt, but they arguably offer some boons.  Many 
biologists suggest that sex arose as a defense to parasites.  And hosts might 
wisely favor a co-evolved parasite to the murderous predator it crowds out of 
the niche.

Perhaps flamewars have some useful side effects.  They might help drive the 
evolution of better rhetorical tools (see, e.g., Godwin's Law and its use in 
argument) or software tools (as Anders probably intends to suggest).  Or, 
more ominously, perhaps flamewars kill off lists that have grown old, weak, 
and ideologically brittle.

None of this goes to show that we ought to *encourage* either parasitism or 
flamewars.  But it does suggest that we ought to beware of unintended 
consequences of over-reacting to unwanted email.  One thinks of the 
consequences of overusing antibiotics (banning all pesky email?) or of 
scratching infestations ("STOP IT" emails?).

Thanks Elizabeth for the clarity - I agree with it completely.  For me the gun
debate stopped nearly a week ago once I put up the appropriate filters.  I check
the archives from time to time to see how the debate is progressing.  Since I am
not in the mood to discuss gun issues right now, I activated the temporary
filter.

By consistently not voting for their re-election if they flip-flop, of 
course.  Money has influence, but it is votes which elect (and re-
elect or defeat) politicians.

If a collector wishes to collect many guns, and even trade and 
barter them for other weapons with other collectors, fine; but this 
should not be used as a cover for illicit gun dealing.  If a collector 
sells some of his weapons, the sales should come under the same

Ecstacy, wasn't discovered, it was made, and it was made from a combination
of an  earlier synthetic drug (krank) and a hallucenogenic. The eirlier
drug, krank, ( a man made speed) is what was used by the german military.
Not exctacy, it wasn't made yet.

How about something a little less nanotechnologically intensive.
A device, or collection of devices that aids homeostasis- monitors
internal states and tweaks them back to optimum- that resides in the
stomach and/or intestinal tract. A cybernetic " tapeworm". A minimally
invasive device, it could even be modular like a tapeworm. It might be
powered by the potential difference between the proximal and distal small
intestine or even a methane (lots of that in the gut) fuel cell. With a
gut length of about ten meters, even a device with only a ten millimeter
cross-section would have plenty of room for a lot of useful technology
and if modular, an defective module could just be jetisoned and replaced
by a swallowed update. With an extension into the hepatic tract it could
even have access to the circulation through the portal system. It would
be repairable insitu ( endoscopy ) and with a through-the abdomen port (
belly button?) even better access to the outside could be possible.

I disagree. The people who post excessively are exactly those who
don't maintain subject line discipline. And why should the workload of 
filtering be shifted to the _readers_? So far, my consistent
experience has shown that content carriers don't bother with
filtering. They just leave.

Voting mechanisms for excluding noncomplying posters are easy enough
to implement with a few 10 lines of a scripting
language. Authentication tokens make it pretty hard to forge, too.

This is a tough problem, one which is nearly identical to a previous
experience on this list.  We could cut and paste a three week section
of the archives from last fall, and no one would notice.

Elizabeth's party analogy is good in that the amount of time I have to
read extropians varies daily.  Some days I need to delete everything
unread, other days I have time to read even some of the gun rants.  {8^D

I wish I knew why that particular subject (guns) nukes this particular list.
The best I can suggest is to repeatedly ask politely, everyone use
subject line discipline, *especially* when talking about tired old
topics.  And, newbies, take a few hours to peruse the archives.

Question: does it cost the extropy.org money to handle the heavy
message load when the gun virus hits?  Is it charged per message?  spike

I can hear the howls of anguish from the NRA now. Imagine having to make a
phone call to check someone out before a gun deal!

By the way - here in Illinois the check is via a 1-900 call - cost me $5.00
the last time - but the check is just a go/no go thing - the sale is still
recorded per other laws, and an FOID is still required. This should be more
than enough of a paper trail if it is followed by all involved. Private
sales and trades here require the seller to keep a record for many years of
the buyer's name - but none of the paperwork is required to be filed with
anyone. I guess that was the lawmaker's way of assuaging fears of a
registry of who's got the gun this week...

Well there's a simple solution to that, add a few lines of
Perl to the mailing list software so it rejects any message
sent to the list without any subject keywords. i.e. if Joe
tries to send a message through to the list with the subject
"Mike can suck my !!!!" then it never gets sent out. If he
sends "GUNS: Mike can suck my !!!!" then it would go through.

I'd be more than happy to add this to the software if it is
written in Perl and no one else wants to do it.

It's quite likely that the Pentagon will try to fully exploit
nanotechnology.  The New Zealand Herald (May 21 1999) reported that
Michigan Uni scientists were developing 'nano-bombs' to help protect
soldiers from biological warfare.  The research was funded by the
Defence Department.  (These nanobombs apparently fuse with bacteria
etc, such as anthrax,  and then explode, while leaving human cells
unharmed.)

(Gina might have mentioned this elsewhere - apologies for repeating it if 
so.)

An intracellular nanodevice would be partly protected from this. 
Intracellular parasites other than viruses produce weak immune responses as 
their foreign protein mostly remain inside themselves and are less likely to 
make it to the surface of the cell.  Hence, partly,  the stubborness of 
malaria, leprosy, and tuberculosis.

You could put some of the nanodevices into the immune clonal deletor cells to 
induce tolerace, although I don't know how long that would take.

That's a nifty idea, and would not require nanotech.  A resident
monitor would be extremely handy.  The main problem would be attachment to 
the intestinal wall, which would be a little tough for a mechanism.
Maybe a cyborg tapeworm? :-)  They are pretty harmless, albeit gross.

I haven't had a problem with the gun subject lines.  I have recognized
and deleted almost every one.  Twice, I think, I've checked out a 
new tagline that I didn't realize was gun-related but once I saw
the first I just deleted the rest of the thread.  

I haven't found the gun flamewar particularly distressing as I already
deal with a goodly amount of spam anyway.  It's just one more source.
