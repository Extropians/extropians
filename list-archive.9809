The biggest problem when it comes to the underdeveloped countries is not
that their farmland is unfertile. It is that theír infrastructure is poor.
Even if we could feed them all it's a slippery path to walk.

Free food and other material products will destroy their (farming) economy
as indeed it has done in several of the undeveloped countries. There simply
is no incetive to work for food if you can get it for free. Thus the food
crisis goes on and on. Therefore it will be best in the long run to keep the
material aid to a minimum. Not counting disaster aid off course.

What does bring wealth though is educated labor. Therefore the best thing we
can do to help these countries is to educate them self.

A technological way to do this, and a good idea for an extropian bussines,
would be to make a "hardware browser" for the internet. A touch sensitive A4
screen that has the functionality of one of top browsers. If it then ran on
solar power and connected to the net via sattelite it should be useable
everywhere.

Oh yeah... it should be dirt chep.

<grin>Maybe drop them by airplane in the undeveloped areas. "Browser
bombing."</grin>

It would probably cost less than many other expensive foreign aid projects
and would help the poor to help themself.

Education is one of the most lucrative products there currently is. Considering
the creeping credentialism and all that that capitalism espouses which is now in
the ascendant, it isn't a matter of being educated but it is the 'being
qualified' that counts most to the bureaucratic accumulators. The real problem
that needs addressing is the actual concept of monetary wealth. To this end, the
high dimensionality of constructivist AI will inevitably subvert the
capitalist's accounting methodology. In the meantime the 'money talk' that scams
daily from every nook and cranny of public space will become so nauseating that
the human race will finally become sensitized against this obscene entity. When
this happens, hopefully the timing will be such that the money collaborators
will not be able to stare down this new form of intelligence.

Speaking of which, does anyone here remember the electoral fright that started
the current round of economic meltdowns from way over there in Thailand. That's
right; - a monk who had taken a vow of poverty almost won control of the Thai
parliament.

Re-examining Table 3, I find reasons for caution.  Their format is odd,
relative to economics standards, as they don't include standard errors.
And the coefficient values of soc/psych influence on internet use are
about the same size as internet use influence on soc/psych.  So I'd want
them to verify that the scaling of the parameters implies that in fact
the estimated influence one way is much bigger than the other way.  Given
that they do that, I'd be comfortable again with their results.

That's from the pre-trial psychological conditions.  Changes in
psychological state after the screening test don't affect internet
use, by their model.

The study's nowhere near large enough to conclude that for depression.
With loneliness, the difference should be significant because the
association between usage and pre-study is negative, while the post
study association is positive.  

The details of the study were better than the summary implied.  I'd like
to see the results without the internet usage hours truncated.  If there
is a causal relationship, extremely heavy users should be very messed up.
One hypothesis would be internet addiction, a la gambling/alcohol/etc
addiction.  In this case, light and moderate users should be fine and
the heavy users will be the ones with the problems.  Destructive 
addictive behaviors often have tangled causal relationships - depression
make you drink, drinking makes you depressed, etc.

FWIW, I find the internet unsatisfying as a social medium.  I speak much
faster than I type and I much prefer the phone.

Er, how exactly do you mean here?  That is, how and why exactly will AI
influence the accounting business?

They are trying to use the timing of variables to infer causality;
things that are measured earlier likely cause, and are not caused by,
things that are measured later.  So to disambiguate cause, they measure
soc/psych both before and after internet use.  Of course there's always
the possiblity of unmeasured variables causing everything, such as 
unmeasured "during" soc/psych.  But it seems to me they have done the
reasonable thing with the data the have.

Huh?  They used log of internet hours, without truncation.  They truncated
social circle and minutes with family, but undoing that wouldn't seem to 
help your addiction scenario.  It does seem they should have logged those 
variables without truncation though.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

I just stumbled upon an Oct '97 Scientific American article,
by A. Schafer & D. Victor (pp. 58-61) on "The Past and Future
of Global Mobility."  The article, minus some graphs:
http://www.sciam.com/1097issue/1097schafer.html .  They make 
forecasts out to 2050 which, suprisingly enough, I find believable.  

The main reason one might forecast out so far is that transportation
infrastructures take a long time to change, and there are some robust 
relationships to build on.  Across diverse societies, transportation 
time seems to take a bit over an hour per day, and distance
travelled seems to be roughly linear with income.  People in poor
countries spend about 3-5% of income on bikes & buses, and this 
fraction rises till it stabilizes at 10-15% of income when there is 
about one car per five people.  

It seems that the future of tranport is airplanes, which by 2050
should take 12 minutes per day on average in the U.S., and 
account for 41% of world distance traveled.  (Buses would account
for 20%, and cars 35%.)   

The same issue also contains a reasonable skeptical take on 
telecommuting, at http://www.sciam.com/1097issue/1097mokhtarian.html .

Demonstrate an instance of widespread hunger due to slippery roads.  I'll

Educated labor does not bring wealth for being educated.  Education only
increases returns.  A consistent legal system is more fundamental.  See
Russia.

Cheap to you and perhaps relative to some other aid projects.  Extremely
expensive relative to the incomes of the poor.  The primary beneficiary of
such a project would be the producer of the gadget.  Unsurprising.  That's
how many aid projects work.

I suppose such a device would also have a clickwrap agent to promote the
transfer of dirt farmers' incomes to Disney and the spread of commercially
produced culture's hegemony.

I'm glad you asked. What I mean by hoping that there will be beneficial timing in
a change of methods, is another way of saying that I'm not for a complete and
utter destruction of the capitalist system prior to installing its replacement,
but instead would prefer to opt for an orderly and enlightened change over. I'm
encouraged towards the later because of historical evidence in support of this
view as expressed by the ultimate holders of capitalist power themselves wanting
to control the entire world's wealth simply in order to get rid of monetary
speculation and the system that that measurement of wealth entails. However in
the many worlds scenario these folk are playing in an enviroment beyond their
control.

As to how and why AI will influence the accounting business, several comments
need to be made. Firstly, it will become obvious that AI's data mining efforts
are being frustrated by the inability to access full transactional content. Then
it will become globally apparent that national currencies are in fact an
unregulated but inferior form of supervised neural network (i.e., all those
cumbersome hidden layers, the invisible hand of capitalism, etc.) Capitalism is
not a natural law of nature, as some like to say, and was born during times of
inferior data gathering concepts.

The literature of nonmonotonic relativity/clustering techniques shows up the
skewed injustice of price coercion and other new connectionist models have been
around long enough for these comparisons to have been noticed even by the
accounting community. However, as a basis for experiment such a manifest
changeover will become the grand top-down AI challenge of the 21st century simply
because it exists and models can be attempted. Look to make analogies of ice
damage repair in cryonics patients and you will see the frustrating pattern
matching problems to those which a global economic AI network will have to
address. In economics it is the loss of transactional binding caused by the
inherent privacy of the capitalist accounting methods that will become an obvious
problem to be solved.

Bi-directional transactional 'binding' is the key problem to which David Brin has
shown the solution. BTW, next to me David Brin considers himself a moderate and
politically as this word spreads, the inevitability and/or timing of an economic
AI network is the same whether or not capitalism gives up its hold willingly or
is defeated and economic AI rises from the ashes of bloody conflict. Which do you
prefer?

Next question?

I'm not sure what you mean here.  I suspect we've been reading very
different books.  :)

Most of the so-called "many worlds" scenarios that I'VE heard of tend to
posit that all logically possible worlds exist, which on some level renders
*everything* irrelevent.  Is that what you're referring to?

So a "superior" form of neural network (unsupervised, presumably?) would be
coordinated by/with/through AI?  I take it you're presuming that AI will
come in the form of a neural-like network or some other complex information
processor.  The impression I'm getting then is that people will turn on the
Internet-or-something to find out what they need to do today (possibly
wiring straight into the wet ware so that they're actually thinking with
the net themselves).  Am I close so far?

I have no clear idea at all what this sentance means.
Relativity/clustering techniques?  Are you referring to the way in which
income equality is measured?  There's a lot of different people and ways of
thinking that call themselves "connectionist."  What do YOU mean here?

What sort of binding are you referring to here?  I'm not aware of Brin
approaching a problem like what you're describing.

Even by that standard, then, they've overreached in deducing causation.
Neither the family communication-usage nor depression-usage correlations
changed significantly from pre to post, although loneliness probably 
did.

Also, the *change* in psychological state is contemporaneous with
internet use, and so with respect to that as a causative factor, they
don't have temporal control.  If *losing* friends makes people turn
to the internet (as opposed to not having them in the first place)
then you get the reported results, even with the reverse of the inferred
causation.

I had a similar idea a while back and wrote a post about it on
March 15 1997.


A few years ago I read about a technique for seeing through opaque
objects  with optical LASER pulses of astronomical intensity but modest
energy, I remember seeing a picture of a newspaper taken through
several inches of milk, you could still read it. I wonder if a device working
on a similar principle could be used to obtain enough information from a non-
destructive brain scan to upload a mind.

When most photons that make up an image enter milk they are refracted
off the many fat globules in solution, if any photons come out the other side
of the milk container they have been bounced around so much that the
information on where they originated is hopelessly scrambled, all you would
see is a diffuse glow, not an image. However, a few very lucky photons,
perhaps  one in a billion trillion, perhaps less, can make it through the milk
without interacting with anything. Because these rare photons don't get
bounced around but take a shorter direct path, they are the first photons to
emerge from the milk. If you only looked at those early photons and ignored
the much more numerous later ones, you could see an image and not just a
general glow.

I don't remember the researcher's name or the exact specifications of
his LASER, but I do know that intensities as high as 10^18 watts per square
centimeter and pulses as short as 10-14 seconds have been achieved with
table top LASERS. You'd want to squeeze every bit of information out of the
rare photons that make up the image, so just recording their amplitude, as
in photography, would not be good enough, you'd want to know their phase
too, and that means Holography. As a bonus, you wouldn't have to worry about
depth of field focusing problems, and the reference beam for the Hologram
could act as a super fast camera shutter, use a different frequency for the
reference beam pulse and put in a filter for the original frequency.

10^-14 seconds might be too long for a safe brain scan at the enormous
intensities required, and light can travel about a tenth of a millimeter in
that time, but I'll bet a soft X ray LASER could be built with a lot
shorter pulse than that, I just hope it can be made short enough that the brain
is not vaporized.  Anyway it's just a thought.

We completely agree, but i meant the complet infrastructure. Including the
political system. Perhaps i am using the term infrastsucture to widely. I
was thinking about everything that holds a "civilized" society together.
Court system, government, educational system, commercial system and off
course roads, bridges, houses etc.

If there is to be wealth there has to be knowledge and education first. Not
astrophysics for dirt farmers but soemthing they can use. At least they have
have som way to get the information.

In my view wealth comes form technology. Technology consists of Methods and
hardware. Here I think that the soft part, the methods, are the most
important. Democracy is certainly an important part of technology to
understand and know about.

To create a basis for economic growth it is important to teach them how to
do it themself.

Yes that is correct. But it would be cheap compared to building schools and

Great idea ;-) but perhaps it would be a good idea to concentrate on the

imperialism.

  I'm not sure what you mean here.  I suspect we've been reading very
  different books.  :)

  Most of the so-called "many worlds" scenarios that I'VE heard of tend to
  posit that all logically possible worlds exist, which on some level renders
  *everything* irrelevant.  Is that what you're referring to?

see http://www.airtime.co.uk/users/station/m-worlds.faq

However, I'm leaning towards the idea that maybe a quark-like thingy can vibrate
backwards and forwards through time to stitch up coincidental cause and effect
though
not necessarily in that order. In other words, an awful lot of historical baggage
will have to have been created in order to knock out a simple software idea who's
time has come.

To see this simple software idea  - http://come.to/ingrid

More to the point, look at the way my email is slopped around, not only on this
list but all throughout the course of unmediated human communication. Thread
meltdown occurs as easily as subject headings getting changed willy nilly. When
the Skull & Bones storm troopers come out of the woodwork to slay perceived
dragons, information loss is the result. With all this undisciplined communication
all that is likely to happen is that we will continue to jabber on while the super
intelligent AI networks surpass any efforts at human control. However this doesn't
have to be the case. As you know, I have an expressed interest in the future
development of feedback loops via continuously adjusted summaries of all
encompassing global activities.

Don't like what's going on here? Need a soapbox? Have a beef about something or
other
then this will be your chance to have a say in the making of new global politics.
I envision
a transitional and arbitrary global government based on a one size fits all
qualitative
statistical mediator which works with synaptic units relative to the components at
hand
where the results of each neuronomy (my word) affect the operation of super
ordinate
constructions and vise versa. Best of all, I don't have to lift a finger because
it's already
happening anyway. This is not just some utopian concept and because of the
practicality
of now causally linking the billions of currently isolated clusters of information
the result
would be a conscious reflection about the world. Hopefully, it would be to this
common
sense that super intelligences will initially look for their source of identity
and motivation, so in a sense we can control them by providing their ideal self
image. Hopefully this image will reflect human effectiveness. There will be lots
of daunting realities that may remain
as unconscious elements however these will not be forgotten and should be able to
re-surface as conditions change.

The biggest hurdle to acceptance of such a form is not the criminal or deviant
abuser
though their numbers will drastically shrink, but in aspiring to the rational hope
that such an active global mediator can handle the problems of economic planning
at all levels and
in fact do away with the use scarcity money for exchange or to store value. From
the
individual to the group much the same software in all its guises will be on hand
to act as
an intellectual collaborator for going right at the fabric of life as well as
guiding the
individual through later uploading processes.

  So a "superior" form of neural network (unsupervised, presumably?) would be
  coordinated by/with/through AI?  I take it you're presuming that AI will
  come in the form of a neural-like network or some other complex information
  processor.  The impression I'm getting then is that people will turn on the

  wiring straight into the wet ware so that they're actually thinking with
  the net themselves).  Am I close so far?

A reserved "Yes" to the above, except that needs and wants are necessarily
undertaken
as different processes. The present economic drivers may/will still be active but
there
will also be so many more all using the same forms of abstraction and delving into
those
hard to get at bionomic and personal areas that the methods of reporting the same
and
the motivation for doing so will be so unlike what restricted capitalism offers,
so much so,
that the means of transactional measurement should at least for clarity's sake not
be
called money. Don't forget that no land area on earth is presently exempt from the

totalitarian concept of money and that exchanging one concept for another at
particular
moments in history has been done before. Like I said before the world's rulers are
on
record as wanting to ultimately do away with capitalism and currency speculation.
Let's
give them this part of what they want with the added rider that they then forget

  I have no clear idea at all what this sentence means.
  Relativity/clustering techniques?  Are you referring to the way in which
  income equality is measured?  There's a lot of different people and ways of
  thinking that call themselves "connectionist."  What do YOU mean here?

No, I'm referring to the way in which clusters of information need to maintain a
set of
measurements applicable to type and where the same measurements can be used in
other classifications. For example, at certain levels of abstraction the numbers 1
trough 5
could be used to represent the qualitative value of everything providing the
element
being measured was in the correct context. In another example, a needs analysis
would
register the appropriate amount of information to cause an action. I don't foresee
the need to restrict the use of these numerical abstractions because of a scarcity
of bits and there won't need to have an income of bits allotted as each
abstraction will not subtract from a pool like money does in capitalism. Each
abstraction will be a reflection amongst larger and larger circulations. Anyway,
this is my view of a positive sum economy or what I now term a neuronomy. Get it?

Also, there is a common acceptance of what represents old connectionism and new
connectionism. I understand basically that perceptrons were of the old kind and
PCA / radial basis functions are of the newer. What is being looked for is less
layers and more inferencing.

  What sort of binding are you referring to here?  I'm not aware of Brin
  approaching a problem like what you're describing.

No, seriously! The bindings I refer to will make use of particular information a
known
event to the other parties concerned. In other words the little guy will
automatically be
afforded knowledge of how his personal data is being used by government and
business.

I think Brin here is referring to my concept of binding, however we differ as to
what

attack
on the methods of accounting such that the use of the term 'money' may well be
consigned to the dustbin of history.

I think increasing the world avg. income would be far more plausible than

I have no doubt that the distribution of wealth is similar to those
figures you have stated here.  It is this distribution, however, that
provides momentum in the economy.  It gives incentive for individuals to
earn more and provides a concentration of funds that companies can then
reinvest in new technologies.  This adds to the total wealth of the
system.

The challenge therfore is to find a economic model that allows a more
equitable distribution of wealth whilst not reducing the incentives to
generate wealth.

If you remove cost from the debate nothing will ever be done to help
anybody.
Who pays? Who pays? Who pays?
Unfortunately these are the three question most people will
ask.  Answering these questions with "It's the right thing to do." will
compel only a few individuals to act.  A better way to answer is to point
out the benefits of paying.  Bringing third world countries up to frist
world standards provides many wealth generating advantages to
both countries and coporations.

This is one of the best ideas I've heard for a while.  Information is the
only thing we can give third world coutries that will not reduce the
incentive to be self sufficient.  This self-contained browser sounds
like an excellent system of delivery.

Are you suggesting creating a giant neural net to
facilitate resource sharing, so rather than be
held at the whim of capitalists the economy itself
will decide who gets what and when?

Accuracy of copies is a function of time allowed to diverge.  The Joe
Jenkins that was me one month ago is close enough to being the me of
today.  The Joe Jenkins that was me more than one month ago all the
way up to 5 years ago is fuzzily close enough to what I consider to be
me.  The Joe Jenkins that was me 5 or more years ago is not close
enough to what I consider the me of today.

If I snap my fingers in front of your eye, you will blink.  As an
upload this instinct will have no utility or henderance.  However, I
believe there are natural born instincts that do have a conflict of
interest to becoming a competitive Posthuman.  One of them is to
protect our flesh and value its existence in the physical world.  Many
on this list have tackled inoculating themselves against culturally
bred memetic viruses.  This is a piece of cake when compared to
ridding ourselves of natural born instincts.

Being able to casually think of identity and survival as something
other than my physical self took me many years of deep inspection.  I
don't think it is possible to learn to think this way overnight.  Even
once I thoroughly understood the issues and invented many thought
experiments, I found I had to repeat them literally hundreds or
thousands of times over several years before I became comfortable.  I
was slowly but surely conditioning myself and physically changing my
mind.  I was motivated by what I see as a show stopper/road block to
Posthumanity.  I don't believe for a second that competitive
Posthumans will be biological in any way.  Oh sure, there may be some
that survive, but they will be little insignificant Posthumans nowhere
near the forefront, living the life of mediocrity.  They'll be Looked
at as massive resource wasting dinosaurs.  And they'll be there
because of an inability to shed their save the flesh/remain in the
physical/fight consciousness discontinuity instincts at an early stage
in the swell.

I have difficulty seeing biological beings operating at competitive
speeds and power usage.  I also have difficulty in seeing Posthumans
having an interest in perceiving the natural world in any way similar
to the way we see it.  The nature all around us just moves too slow to
be interesting to a speeded up mind.  To a posthuman it all seems more
like a still picture.  If we want to have a familiar lifestyle after
speeding up or minds, it will have to be in an artificial reality
similarly sped up.  For a posthuman to move through the physical world
at speeds that match her thinking speed would require what I think
Robin Hanson called "Lillitopian Uploads"(sp?).  At speeds thousands
of times that of our minds, posthumans who remain in the physical
world with an atmosphere would have to be insect size to keep from
burning up due to friction with the air.  Just trying to move an
appendage to accomplish a task in reasonable real-time would require
that appendage to move its full distance in microseconds.  I see it as
very likely that posthumans who remain at the forefront of competition
will have to be uploads.

You have to be careful with the line of reasoning that says you can
just define yourself to be whatever you want.  Otherwise I define "me"
as including every member of the human race.  Presto, I am virtually
immortal, incredibly powerful, spread over the entire planet, able to
work my will virtually anywhere.  (Of course I do have a bit of trouble
making up my mind.)  This seems to be a very attractive definition of
identity from the pragmatic point of view.  But somehow it seems to miss
the point, doesn't it?

They went in and caused internet access for these people, so they presume
that any change they then see in soc/psych is caused by internet access,
rather than the other way around.

Translation: The reason AI's don't know everything is because they don't

The best way to improve the world's currencies is to increase the amount
Of speculation on them not decrease it. If an individual would rather
be paid in pounds than dollars let him, if a nation tried the old
tax by inflation trick people could just switch to a better currency.

 >Capitalism is not a natural law of nature, as some like to say,

I like to say that there are many parallels between capitalism and
Thermodynamics as well as Evolution.

 >and was born during times of inferior data gathering concepts.

Yes, data gathering concepts have improved, so have data hiding concepts,
and the economy has become astronomically more complex.


 >the grand top-down AI challenge of the 21st century


For an AI to design the economy in which it lived better than the market
can it would have to understand it, but that's impossible. The most
important economic factor in the world is people but people don't
understand people very well so they can't design an economy very well.
A super intelligent AI would be the most important thing in its world but
Turing proved in 1935 that it would be no better at predicting its
behavior than we are.

An economy is the most complex object in the known universe, an individual
human brain is trivial in comparison, and you expect to design one from
first principles and expect it to work? It would be like trying to derive
the laws of political science by studying the ramifications of the
Schrodinger wave equation.

Personally I find nothing totalitarian about money, but if you disagree
that's OK, just refuse to have anything to do with it. I find it amusing
when people go on and on about how evil money is and then find out
the most evil thing about it is that they don't have enough of it.

Mr. Stalin, we'll help you destroy capitalism but once that's done and
you become the only power center in the world you must promise to
voluntarily step down from power, OK?. I know we can trust you because
history has taught us that dictators are always men of high moral fiber.

That's the fatal flaw in Brin's idea, he doesn't like encryption but he
never makes clear exactly how he plans to stop people from using it.

But by this same criterion, you are not the same
person that wrote this post, and you weren't even
30 seconds later!  This seems nonsensical, since
it implies that the death of people goes on all the
time, inevitably (and that therefore the sudden 
termination of someone's body is nothing to get
excited about).
You keep saying that because they are in different
states of mind (one terrified, one complacent), that 
they are radically different, and I don't see that.  I was
terrified last night (close auto accident), but I am not
a substantially a different person today because of
it.

No, it doesn't.  I find some methods of uploading
unacceptable.  For instance, if we had a machine 
which destructively scanned my brain and after it
was gone wrote a program that simulated it, I 
wouldn't believe that a person could live *through*
such a process.  On the other hand, if the machine
only removes a few neurons at a time, replacing 
their functionality with programming or hardwired
machinery, *and* thought could take place during
and between these episodes, then I believe that 
the resulting person would still be me.  There is a
dividing line in there somewhere, but I don't know
where it is.

 Some extropian types at Agorics are working on a way for anyone with
a bank account to send or receive electronic checks. See:
http://www.agorics.com
and
http://www.fstc.org/projects/echeck/index.html
 There are enough big banks involved in this project that it is likely
to catch on for large users. Whether the bankers will make the UI or API
awkward enough to deter individuals from using it is unclear. I don't
know when it will be possible for individuals to try it out.

Given your stand on identity and survival, it is still unclear to me
what survival utility you find in such a technology - and also what
survival utility you find in destructive upload technology.

I know you've been consistent here.  At first, I was a little confused
because I had always assumed the characters in your fiction (about
copying and uploading) were portrayals of irrational people - not
yourself.  It seems clear now that you were portraying your own
position which, given your stand on the issues of identity, is not
irrational.

In addition to John, I pose the following questions to anyone on the
list who wants to respond:

If non-destructive technology were available, would you choose to
upload and keep your biological self alive or terminate it?

If you choose to keep your biological self alive.  Would you not
expect that eventually after many augmentations that biological/cyborg
self would see the limitations and inefficiency of living in the
physical world and want to upload into Homodigititus himself?

If yes, would you want this process to terminate the biological/cyborg?

If no, would you not expect that after sufficient divergence that that
biological/cyborg self would not feel the pressure of being a massive
resource wasting relic of the past because of his (living in the
physical world) status and want to upload himself?

If yes, do you not see a problem with this infinitely repeating cycle?

Then do you see some sort of logic in the madness?

Or, do you think there will always be a place in the
physical/non-uploaded world for sentient beings on the forefront of
posthuman competitiveness?  Of course, I'm not trying to imply that
eventually nothing will exist in the physical world.  And I do
recognize the importance of probes and sensors connected to uploaders
in real-time.  But, I see artificial reality as being the place of
choice for all the movers and shakers of Posthumanity.  I think
manipulation of the physical world will be mostly automated with
little real-time involvement from sentient beings of the Posthuman
rank.  Thus, I see the above cycle as eventually coming to a halt as
the biological/cyborg realizes the error of his ways.

This part of my definition does require a lot of caution.  In my case,
however, you have to keep in mind that my last couple of post gave a
precise definition of what I think is me.  I was clumsily assuming
everyone would keep that in mind.  Without a precise definition to
accompany "whatever I think is me" the statement is useless.

I wouldn't use any scanning technique to upload, since IMO the
copy wouldn't be "me"; I'd rather have gradual uploading by means 
of computer implants, or perhaps nano-assisted neuron-by-neuron 
replacement of the biomass by artificial structures _while I'm 
conscious_ (yeah,yeah, call me old-fashioned... ;-)

Well, in my favourite scenario that cyborg would be *me* (no copies),
possibly just a "brain in a jar" hooked up via direct neural interfaces
to a massive computer and support systems (with "weak" AI "agents" 
to assist my thinking etc.). This contraption, thanks to the power of nano 
soon many miles accross, would float in space (a sphere would probably 
be the most logical design). "I" would live in VR worlds or interact directly 
with the outside world trough probes and perhaps various larger (humanoid?) 
avatars. 
 
> If yes, would you want this process to terminate the biological/cyborg?

The biological self, soon only a insignificant little piece of the megabrain,
could be removed as soon as all its data had been copied, and my
"mind" had migrated into the rest of the structure. Then it would be 
comparable to removing a single, obsolete brain cell.

Here's the plan:

A student at Temple University buys Brin's book
thinking its science fiction; he doesn't discover
that it is, in fact, speculative non-fiction until
he reaches page 296. (Bare with me here - I'm
trying to establish a scenario in which someone
would willingly read the entire book.) Stunned by
the validity of Brin's claims he decides to print
a story on the righteousness of being open in a
university journal. The journal reaches an
audience of several hundred thousand, who in turn
tell others. By August 29th 1999 the
anti-encryption movement has over 14 million
members. That day they meet in Washington DC to
cast of the shackles of security and burn their
private keys. Within a month the movement has
grown to some 100 million, and Internet users now
freely post their credit card numbers to alt.2600
in an act of rebellion. By 2010, despite the fact
that economists had proved Brin's theory false 11
years ago, the Openness Policy has been adopted by
the government; and free love has been declared in
the white house. Only a small group of backwards
thinking people retains their privacy. At first
these "Clarktarians" accuse the others of
stupidity, but soon they realise their own power
and begin building an underground network. In the
year 2012 the Clarktarians overthrow the
government and establish a brutal capitalist
regime.

Next week: Find out how the fearless Clarktarian
leader, John K. Clark, changes David Brin's mind
armed only with a copy of The Transparent Society.
("Not so transparent now, is it Brin?")

What I think you are describing is a gradual upload then constrained
by the lack of flexibility to execute on different platforms and make
use of backups for survival of disasters.  For your sake, I hope its
going to be an awfully safe and non-competitive world.  If not, sorry
to see you go just because of some silly "old fashion" superstition
(IMHO).

I read the entire book willingly.  I'm surprised at the
vehemence of people who dislike the book.  I thought
the book was quite well done, even though by and large
I'm not in agreement with Brin.  The most gaping flaw is
that he doesn't say enough about how to break 
cryptosystems.  That didn't bother me especially, as
pervasive surveillance technology definitely puts a big
dint in the hopes of crypto fans. If you assume that
surveillance becomes pervasive, then being able to
break crypto or not is irrelevant to the larger
point of the book.

no less than material things have mass.  "Capitalism" is a choice
of human behavior that history has shown to be consistent with
that law and human desires in the way that how one chooses to

At least I know how to answer that question. Here, in yet another sidetracked
cul-de-sac, beg your pardon, thread you will see the mechanism for answering
your question. Later, I postulate that after it becomes superfluous to expose
the tech behind the answer then the terms you use are called into question and
may cease to have significance. However, none of the reasoning behind this
rubric(sp?), or should I say rebuke of your argument, is lost to posterity and
can replay as independent components shift.

I think this misses the point.  Imagine that your brain and my brain were
hybridized (possibly through/with an AI).  At that point, we would no
longer use an "economy" to allocate resources; we'd just make up our
collective mind and go for it.  So the goal is not to eliminate
speculation, but to eliminate the economy and replace it with a different,
very complex system.

I think.  Legg's posts have a very high buzzword ratio.

This is interesting.  What sort of parallels do you see?

The impression I got was that Brin thinks encryption will be pointless when
one can maneuver a fly-sized camera into your home and watch you type in
the cleartext of your message before you have a chance to encrypt it.
Heck, reading the cleartext even beats OTPs. ;)

Personally, I'm dubious as to the degree to which this is possible; it's
certainly not possible in realtime, but the fly-camera could work if it
recorded onto some kind of very small RAM system and then returned home to
upload the recording onto a larger computer.  Diffraction problems could be
solved by having multiple bugs staring at the same thing and having a
computer sort out what the true image looks like.  Again, not possible in
realtime, but if the bugs took shifts, it wouldn't be a big issue.

I know about that.  You still have to spell this out for me.  I still don't

This software idea is so simple that I don't see how it relates to our
conversation at all, except possibly to the extent that we might think of
it as a primitive form of AI.

<sigh>  You're bringing up topics before you're explaining them; your use

Are you referring to the secret society "Skull & Bones" of which former
president George Bush was a member?  How does Skull & Bones "slay a
perceived dragon," as you put it, and how does that result in information
loss?  What does the activity of Skull & Bones and/or the loss of certain
information have to do with AI?  I presume that it relates to m-w in that
the loss of information represents an irreversible process.  Moreover,
beyond the fact that S&B has an agenda, what does any of THAT have to do
with accounting?

I didn't know that, nor do I know what sort of feedback loops you had in

activities?  I have no clear idea as to what this is; I have even less of
an idea as to why it would be useful.

In short, super-AI will read everything, know everything we can know,

Here again you lose me.  How will super-intelligences get a self image?
Where did common sense come in here?  Why should we hope that it will
"reflect human effectiveness?"  What sort of daunting realities will remain

This sentance is very unclear.  Do you mean that [needs] and [wants] are
undertaken as different processes from each other?  Or do you mean that
[needs and wants] are undertaken as different processes than something else
which you have only intimated?

And for that matter, how are needs and wants "undertaken" in the first place?

Economic drivers?  You mean things that drive the economy, like needs and
wants?  Or something different?  And what other sorts of "drivers" might
appear?  What do you mean by forms of abstraction and delving into bionomic
(do you really mean ecological?) and personal areas?  How do you report a
bionomic area?  What WILL be the motivation for doing so?

As a point of interest, this is a terrible abuse of the term
"totalitarian."  Most totalitarians throughout history have, in fact, been
socialists.  I suggest you stick to the tried and true term "tyrannical,"
if you insist on calling it a system of domination.  But at any rate...

Erm, in general, this is why I tend to oppose those who want to get rid of
money: they want to impose a leader to dictate economic activity instead.
It seems unlikely that any of these rulers will forget about that, since
eliminating money is really extrinsic to their goal of total world domination.

Get it?

No, not at all.  I haven't the foggiest idea what you're referring to in
this paragraph.

Here, lets try a thought experiment.  Suppose you've got a two person
economy, Alice and Bob.  Alice has an apple which she happens to value less
than Bob values the apple.

Now, in capitalism, Bob will pay Alice for the apple, thus maximizing value
and resulting in economic efficiency in the Marshallian sense.  This
process is scalable to all kinds of economic activity.

Now, suppose Alice and Bob had chosen to reject capitalism and instead
operate under a neuronomy.  What would happen?  What would they do?  How
would it work?

What I'm looking for is fewer buzzwords and more content. ;)  You're using

You are not being serious, except to the extent that you are using metonomy

of all forms of communication.  If so, you have not made this clear.
Please try to avoid metaphor in your expository prose; it's driving me up

A capitalistic economy is already an autonomous entity and capitalists
mere components, but I strongly feel it is in need of a purposeful
hybridization to allow it to evolve beyond a zero-sum game. Indeed the
following software component can co-evolve along the way to adjust out
the whim component.

'economy'.

Eh?  There are no "natural" laws which dictate what value is, Objectivism
aside.  Assigning things a price according to supply and demand happens to
maximize economic value, but an anti-capitalist could counter that we're
not maximizing anything that we ought to be maximizing when we do so.

Now, I happen to think that human utility is the good, and to this end,
maximizing economic value tends strongly to maximize human utility.
However, I have no way to prove that Kantian "goodwill" or some other
arbitrarily chosen virtue is not the true good which we should pursue
instead of economic value.

It suddenly strikes me that a useful challenge to the smart people on this
list might be:

Solve the problem of bringing the structurally-unemployed people of the
*first* world up to the standards of their wealthier, currently-employed
fellows.

It used to be thought that egalitarian provision of education would ensure
that everyone of decent intelligence and character could find work.  That
is clearly not true any longer.  

If anything, we can surely expect a larger and larger proportion of the
citizenry to remain outside the job market for life - unless they are
prepared to work for a pittance in some sort of servile `down-stairs' role
- and even those kinds of personal services will be taken over increasingly
by smart, cheap machines.  The only reason to keep a staff of cooks and
servants will be to prove one's superiority, and their inferiority - not a
recipe for a pleasant society in a world where everyone can watch
television and aspire to better things.

The solution I floated in THE SPIKE is one discussed in the 1960s - a
guaranteed minimum income tax, or negative income tax.  That idea has been
assailed by some people here as impractical. It probably requires central
collection and distribution, which some here will dislike.  And, by itself,
it doesn't solve the socio-psychological malaise of those who ride the
`purple wage' (as Phil Farmer called it) while having no meaningful role in
society.

In the longer term, with the advent of molecular nanofacture and AI, we
will *all* be in this position, to some extent.  But those technologies
will perhaps change the landscape so drastically that we will have to start
again from scratch in thinking these issues through.

For now, there are many people out there in the First World who are angry,
baffled, hurt, deracinated - and their numbers can only increase.  If
extropians can find solutions to this deep problem, that will certainly
prove the worth of the philosophy.  `Answers' such as *get rid of the
state* lack the specificity most people without work are looking for...

Sorry, maybe I should have said an immutable law or some other qualifier to
mean that an implementation of this law may not always have to be in
constant use and that other valid implementations could work an economy just
as well. Capitalism is a type of implementation of a law not the law itself.
I would love to show you how a different implementation could grade scarce
things always only using a 1 to 5 scale. I know this other AI implementation

http://come.to/ingrid

can also be consistent with regard to an economy. The problem of using
capitalism to implement an economy is that not many of its accounting
practices can be used on this AI implementation. However AI will develop its
own responses. Capitalism and what I call Neuronomy are from different state
spaces. No doubt both are quite capable of running an economy. However, my
concept of a Neuronomy can to to economics what extropians can do to
redefine the Law of Thermodynamics.

But how would we make up our collective mind?  If you follow Minsky's Society
of Mind concept, or Hofstadter's idealet research, the mind looks like a bunch
of competing entities and processes competing for time and passing in and out
of existence.  Very economic.

Hybridization might reduce some of the potential for cheating.  Given our
capacity for self-delusion, I doubt it would eliminate it.

> This is interesting.  What sort of parallels do you see?
 
Various elements competing for scarce resources over time.  Firms in the
economy, alleles in the gene pool.  Hofstadter says he modeled his research on
simulated annealing, which provides a connection to thermodynamics, but I
always think quasi-Darwinian would also describe it.  Idealets are generated

To obtain a structure from a pattern of photons that make it through a piece
of matter is esentially a diffraction problem.  The trade-offs in wavelengths
of the radiation affect resolution (in space and time) and  the amount of
information recoverable.  This trade-off is similar to the quantum uncertianty
of time and energy , position and momentum (Heisenburg).  Spatial precision
necessary can be argued, depending on assumptions to be 1e-5 meters to 1e-10
meter scale (neuron structure -->protein structure -->atom locatons).  So this
means probably shorter wavelengths than IR.   High intensities or very
energetic photons have the upper limitation also Heisenburg like, of
perturbing the system that they are trying to probe (thermal effects to
breaking of molecular bonds).  

X-rays currently do very large proteins.  The structures are deconvoluted and
can be simulated, the analogous goal of uploading.  For them, the
computational requirements are absolutly state of the art.  In the mid 80s, my
advisor did x-ray photoelectron diffraction experiments.  He simulated the
real structures, and the diffraction patterns of two dimensonal crystal
surfaces.  He ran his code on the fastest  Cray available.

There is no quick fix.  As the economy grows, so will everyone's spending
power.  The only quick change we can make to get people employed is to
eliminate the minimum wage.  Beyond that, all we can do is to continue to
invest.  By that I mean investment in the very broad sense of the term:
taking a loss today so that you can earn back more than you lost in the
future.  There are a lot of ways to do this: you can invest in new homes,
new machines, new people, and you can also invest in new forms of social
organization like anarcho-capitalism (which, I predict, will be harsh in
its first few years, but better for all in the long term, and thus a good
investment).  But in the end, investment is the only thing that will ever
raise the quality of life for the disadvantaged.

Damien Broderick quoted something I said on the subject in his book

I would want my biological self vaporized one second after the brain
scan was completed. If there was a mistake and the destruction was
delayed for 60 seconds the uploaded John Clark would still want the
biological one destroyed but the original bag of chemicals would
disagree, he'd want to continue to live or better yet, destroy the
upload and upload the biological John Clark again, and this time make
sure it's done properly.

I don't agree. Nature operates on all levels from picoseconds to
billions of years. Humans tend to be most interested in things from a
second up to about a decade, but that's just a function of the way
their brain works, there in no one absolute "real time". The arm on a
Nanotechnology based Assembler would be 50 million times shorter than a
human arm, and that means it could  move back and forth 50 million
times faster than a human arm and just one pound of carbon would be

plenty of things to challenge even a super mind.

During boom times, banks are under pressure to make loans which are
marginally bad.  The loans are OK as long as growth continues, but if
there is a slowdown the loans will fail.  The banks know that there is a
risk of a turnaround, but they feel compelled to make the loans because
other banks are doing so as well.  If a bank is "prudent" and doesn't take
risks by making such loans, it can't match the returns of riskier banks.
Funds will flow out and the bank won't be competitive.

The same effect happens in people's life plans.  Committing to a career
in an industry which faces eventual obsolescence can be seen as an unwise
strategy.  But until the failures start, it is a very rewarding approach.
Someone who tries to be a "jack of all trades" who can switch from
career to career pays the price of not being specialized.  He doesn't
do as well as his competitors who are concentrating on a single industry.
So people are pressured to specialize and leave themselves vulnerable to
structural unemployment.

Once this has happened, once the lifelong buggy-whip maker finds himself
unemployed, it's a little late to fix things for him.  The horse is out
of the barn, he's not pulling buggies any more, and closing the barn
door won't help.  Yes, you can give the poor fellow money, or you can
force others at gunpoint to give him money, but that does not go to the
crux of the problem.

I think in the long run people will adjust to these circumstances.
As obsolescence becomes a more widespread phenomenon, people will adapt
to it.  We've adjusted to death after all, which is really a lot worse
when you think of it.  We have life insurance to mitigate some of the
harmful effects.  Some form of unemployment insurance combined with a
greater emphasis on flexibility can go a long way towards improving the
effects of structural unemployment.

Young people are frequently advised that they need to be prepared to
deal with changes in employment, that they may have to change careers
in midlife.  Hopefully this kind of advice will prove to be helpful as
they move through life.

To bring them up to the same standards would probably not be 
possible without lapsing into a sort of communist systems where 
success is punished, but providing a pretty good standard should
be feasible through massive automation. Even with today's 
technologies it would be possible to make products so efficiently
and cheaply that the state could sell them without loosing money,
or perhaps even with a modest profit. Massive fully automated 
factories churning out tons of wholesome food, clothing, furniture 
etc. at prices even a beggar could afford. This could be combined
with the libertarian idea of abolishing minimum wages (and a basic
form of welfare, probably) and free schooling: those that would be 
willing and able could now take their time to learn some new skills, 
now that they don't have to worry about feeding themselves. In time
there could be free brain enhancements.

There would have to be some taxes (not for those on gov support, 
of course), but they could be quite low due to the efficiency
(and thus low cost) of the automated world (the government
itself would be automated too, thus becoming a lot cheaper
and more efficient itself The income tax would be the same for eveyone, 
so that financial success would no longer be punished like in many 
socialist countries. Red tape for starting a business etc. should be 
cut to an absolute minimum. The state should legalize drugs, 
prostitution, gambling etc, and start providing those services itself
to those that can afford them (the smart/hard-working/lucky ones).
That should help to fill any holes in the budget...

Last but certainly not least: a pre-nanotech system like this could
not support "unlimited" numbers of non-working individuals. Since
it would probably be localized (we're basically talking about 1st
world countries, as Damien suggested), immigrants could not
(automatically) be allowed to profit from the gov support. Also, the
local population would have to refrain from having kids until they've
found a job and can support themselves (provide eveybody with
those handy x-year contraceptive implants). Without measures
like these, taxes would have to keep rising until there would be 
no-one left to pay for the gov services, to do research etc, and
the society would grind to a halt and collapse. However, the
measures could be eased off over time as new, more advanced
technologies (for production) would become available.

Note: I personally like libertarian-esque ideas better, but libertarianism
needs libertarians to work (just like transhumanism needs 
transhumanists to work). If you want everyone in a normal, average
society (with lots of dumb, gullible and incompetent individuals) 
to have a decent living, you'll need something more "socialistic". Besides, 
a truly "gov-less" system is an illusion; a power vacuum will always 
be filled, probably by something totalitarian. But we've been here before...

MNT and AI will quikly lead to SI, and as Vinge puts it:
`Within thirty years, we will have the technological means to 
create superhuman intelligence. Shortly after, the human era 
will be ended.'

The main problem is, that most people have been brainwashed into
believing the idea that one needs work to have dignity and a "meaningful"
life. This once useful meme now often slows down automation, which is 
obviously bad. Also, it is a sad fact that many people are so shallow that 
when forced (by unemployment) to spent more time together, many couples
brake up within a couple of months (recently there had been a study
of laid-off German factory workers that showed a divorce rate of 50%
or so after a relatively short period at home. Quite shocking, IMO).

I would terminate me. I'd do it immediately after
the upload process before I had a chance to be
conscious, otherwise I might get confused.

The real "movers and shakers" could still be
physical. It all depends on which costs more -
simulated mind, senses, and environment, or
simulated mind operating in the real world. The
overhead on simulating the environment might make
being "physical" a healthy advantage.

Quite right, it doesn't. It was an aside that to show my confidence that the

Maybe primitive today but my involvement with this software is my unique ticket
into uploading land. I'm just waiting for hardware to catch up with my own unique
view of how to develop a massively parallel version. If you can't see the Ingrid
software's potential to transform into a full blown brain, well that's not my
problem.

It has to do with knowledge discovery by being able to have software parse the
actual email content. Just look at the actual format above as an example of email
that us humans can barely decipher and then think how hard it will be to extract
meaning ny getting an AI to read this thread. My comment was a lament that
software agents are not available during the actual writing process in order to
structure the knowledge on the fly. Secretly I hope that 'knowledge extractable'
email might be the nicest way to kick start my AI concept. Hey, I'm a dreamer.

I'm sorry I can't help you see the usefulness of my view of how and why AI should

"this" is my view of how and why AI should be implemented at the global level.

"super ordinate constructions" is another term for "core constructs" from the
specialty field of Personal Construct Psychology where the Ingrid software was
developed. See George Kelly's theories. I foresee grids (neurons) dynamically
activating the levels of knowledge extracted according to Kelly's theories.
Qualitative or synthetic data includes such independent componentry that make it
applicable to this imagery type of processing. I would hope that an open structure
would allow enough variables to be processed that the contributors of the data
would trust the inferences displayed. Therefore a "qualitative statistical
mediator" is a software system capable of say presenting solutions to large
problems. I wouldn't be surprised if such a tool was used to design the Northern
Ireland peace proposal. (I know for example that Tony Blair was greatly influenced
by Kelly's work.)

There are classified records of many failed experiments locked away. Read
"Ellsberg on secrecy" to get an idea of the sort of daunting realities that I
referred to. Please understand that my concepts for a global AI based neuronomy
are only possible if all records are available for knowledge extraction and
integration. It is after all only my hope for a hypothetical possibility of a
specific future implementation of AI and it isn't a certainty. To get a handle on
what constitutes the psychiatric term "ideal self image" you need to know that
it's like something that happens to young animals when getting their first
glimpses of their parents.

I'd prefer that humans continually contribute to the AI's synaptic weights along

As a preference I would like to see this tech be as unobtrusive as possible as
regards needed transactions or undertakings - does the tech in the novel about the
Aristoi do this? Wants may operate using other structures but don't pin me to what
these subtleties should be as I don't know and nor could anyone ever address the
situation until it was modeled or in operation.

AI reporting structures will hopefully evolve to suit the needs and before it's
built, like you, I really don't know what to expect or what will be the motivation
for doing so. (Ask me again when I get unlimited computing power and interfaces to
all the worlds knowledge bases:-) The differing sorts of drivers (factors) in each
network node are derived using Kelly's repertory grid technique from the actual
elements making up the node itself.

Yes that was a bad term. I meant that money was in use across the totality of the
earth's surface so much so that it crowds out any discussion of an alternative.
But remember even an ice age can end.

When thinking about a neuronomy it might be easier to consider that it couldn't
work with only two people and would need a highly developed interdependent global
economy where no element was independent. Furthermore it would have come into
existence in a similar way to the internet in that it couldn't be designed without
building it. Your whole question is simply unanswerable because I refuse to answer
that level of detail. This is a pity because you're also not going to find anyone
else to answer your questions as they are too afraid of upsetting their position
in capitalism.

I don't think you want help to connect the dots but if I'm wrong you could do well

Hybridisation with what? Are you saying the
economy's a bit like a neural net so lets make it
even more like a neural net?

I think you're suggesting `filtering' the
interactions of capitalists to fit the model of a
neural net more precisely, but I'm unsure.

Molecular manufacturing certainly puts a new spin
on these problems. With MNT everything can be
recycled, and once everything can be recycled -
nothing is free. This causes a serious problem for
those who live off other people's waste. Also,
because MNT brings most items down to near-zero
cost, nobody can afford to give things away. If
rice (something they need) and microchips
(something you need) cost the same (near-zero)
then you can no longer afford to give rice to the
starving masses (there is no difference in the
price of rice rising and the price of everything
that's more expensive than rice decreasing).

I'm not sure if this made it to the list or not.
If it did, here it is again. If it didn't, then
please feel free to answer my questions.

A few questions about life in an open universe as
described by Dyson in TIME WITHOUT END: PHYSICS
AND BIOLOGY IN AN OPEN UNIVERSE.

Dyson chooses a model in which "human-sized
objects will disappear [within 10^(10^26) years],
but dust grains with diameter less than about
100mu will last for ever". He later proposes that
if this is true life may have to exist as "a large
assemblage of dust grains". Does this mean that
after the elapsed 10^(10^26) years anything over a
100mu diameter would be unable to exist, or merely
that such an object would take that many years to
decay? His later statement about the biology of
future life (the "assemblage of dust grains")
suggests the former, but I'm not sure.

The most interesting thing about Dyson's scenario
is that it imposes a number of limits. These
limits make it easier to predict what life could
`evolve' into. (Tipler's Omega Point in a closed
universe relies on omniscience and is therefore an
omniboring area of conversation.) For instance,
the need for an infinite amount of memory storage
(Dyson suggests analog memory) "will put severe
constraints on the rate of acquisition of
permanent new knowledge". He also proposes scaling
laws, the need for hibernation, and limits to
communication. I'm sure an even better model of
future life could be created. For instance, are
there any fundamental limits to complexity that
would stop *really big* Jupiter Brains from
functioning (increased complexity generally means
more errors and more redundancy)? Will limits to
communication (speed of light, background
radiation) and size (spread of matter in the
universe, rate of decay) insure individuality?

I'm not against Brin's ideas, and I'm not for them

I think Robin had an idea which could help with the problem of structural
unemployment due to job skills becoming obsolete.  The idea was that
you could sell "income futures" which would give the buyer a percentage
share of your future income.  (Apologies if I misunderstood the idea.)

In this system, someone who is in an industry which is doomed to
obsolescence would not be able to make much money from his income futures
contracts.  Savvy investors would see the writing on the wall and know
that there was no long-term value.  Switching to another industry, or
retraining to be able to switch later, would be immediately rewarded
by the increase in value of his futures.  Perhaps the additional value
could even be used to fund the retraining costs.

Which merely means the paranoid will wear head-mounted displays and write
by selecting letters or words with eye-movements, or something similarly
hard to see. And a few years later we'll be performing encryption and
decryption on hardware attached directly to the brain. In any case, finding
me and sending in a thousand fly-sized cameras to read what I'm typing
is much, much, much harder than scanning my plaintext email for keywords
at some centralised server... and as others have pointed out, we'd also
be able to see exactly what the government is doing, so we'd know that
they were sending these cameras around.

Brin's society is a paranoid fantasy which cannot work without stopping
new technological developments and becoming a police state that would
make 1984 look like utopia.

But if it *is* a dangerous and competitive world, withdrawing

True. I said that two exact copies were exactly the same person, in the

Am I really and truly the same person I was 30 seconds ago, how many
angels can dance on the head of a pin? These are probably not useful
questions because they probably don't have meaningful answers. A more
interesting question is, do I want to do the same things I did 30
seconds ago, the answer is no, I already typed the beginning of this
sentence and don't want to do it again. Unless they are in identical
environments two copies will very soon want different things, for
example, one will want copy A to blow his brains out and the other one
will want copy B to do it.

I did propose this, and it would be a way to implement certain kinds of 
unemployment insurance.  

I think asking us to "fix unemployment" is a bit too broad.  It's like
asking us to fix "ill health", "poverty", "stupidity", or "arrogance".  

There are lots of causes of unemployment, and a discussion would best 
focus on one of them if it is to make substantial progress.
1) Search - one is between jobs, and doesn't want to grab the first job 
   that comes along.  Similarly, companies don't want to hire the first
   candidate that comes along.  
2) Minimum wages - supply & demand may not meet with imposed wage bounds.
   The price employers would be willing to pay may be below the bound.
3) Capital constraints - people may not have assets to invest in their
   own education and training, and so may settle for less than their 
   potential.  Others who might invest may be stopped by bankruptsy laws
   which prevent effective indentured servitude.  
4) Time runs out - if your industry/career gets smaller, and you're near 
   retirement, it may not be worth retraining you.
5) Bad luck - if your industry/career gets less in demand, you may have to 
   accept being less in demand.  Insurance can mitigate this loss.
6) Poverty - if you live in a time/place with little capital, and moving
   is prohibitively expensive, capital may be too expensive to make it
   worth training you.

I'll see about backups and such once I'm a SI, and have somewhat
better insights into matters of personal identity. Until then, I'm not
taking any chances.

It's not *how* you upload (from an outside perspective),
but *when*. Whether you scan or use more gradual
techniques, they won't be any good to you if the guy(s)
that went before you block your path. If scanning
comes before the other techniques, then I'd have a 
problem, yes, since suicidal types would have a
clear edge. The only thing that would be left to do then,
would be trying to stop the scanning technique's
development long enough to allow other methods to
become available.

> If not, sorry

It isn't just superstition. If you kept both "yous" alive, the original (you)
would think something like "hey, nothing happened -- there's only some 
dude that claims to be me in that machine, and he's talking about 
shutting me down because I'm 'superfluous'?! Well, m********k him, _he's_
the one that's going to be 'shut down' -- permanently!" [sounds of machine 
being smashed]. So you'd have to kill yourself *directly* after the upload
procedure to save your copy. Pretty dumb, IMO. Why not skip the killing
alltogether and upload by other means?

Did I read this correctly?  A capitalist economy is a 'zero-sum game'  ?
Could Mr. Legg please explain in what context this is true?

Title
  The role of vitrification in anhydrobiosis. [Review] [86
  refs]
Source
  Annual Review of Physiology.  60:73-103, 1998.
Abstract
  Numerous organisms are capable of surviving more or less
  complete dehydration. A common feature in their biochemistry is that they
  accumulate large amounts of disaccharides, the most common of which are
  sucrose and trehalose. Over the past 20 years, we have provided evidence that
  these sugars stabilize membranes and proteins in the dry state, most likely
  by hydrogen bonding to polar residues in the dry macromolecular assemblages.
  This direct interaction results in maintenance of dry proteins and membranes
  in a physical state similar to that seen in the presence of excess water. An
  alternative viewpoint has been proposed, based on the fact that both sucrose
  and trehalose form glasses in the dry state. It has been suggested that glass
  formation (vitrification) is in itself sufficient to
  stabilize dry biomaterials. In this review we present evidence that, although
  vitrification is indeed required, it is not in itself
  sufficient. Instead, both direct interaction and
  vitrification are required. Special properties have often
  been claimed for trehalose in this regard. In fact, trehalose has been shown
  by many workers to be remarkably (and sometimes uniquely) effective in
  stabilizing dry or frozen biomolecules, cells, and tissues. Others have not
  observed any such special properties. We review evidence here showing that
  trehalose has a remarkably high glass-transition temperature (Tg). It is not
  anomalous in this regard because it lies at the end of a continuum of sugars
  with increasing Tg. However, it is unusual in that addition of small amounts
  of water does not depress Tg, as in other sugars. Instead, a dihydrate
  crystal of trehalose forms, thereby shielding the remaining glassy trehalose
  from effects of the added water. Thus under less than ideal conditions such
  as high humidity and temperature, trehalose does indeed have special
  properties, which may explain the stability and longevity of anhydrobiotes
  that contain it. Further, it makes this sugar useful in stabilization of
  biomolecules of use in human welfare. [References: 86]

Additional note by poster:

  Practical application of anhydrobiosis on human organ systems at present
can not use sugars because of their very poor penetration ability. Animals
which can enter anhydrobiosis have special sugar transporters for example
on their cell membranes.
  However some sugar alcohols like erythritol readily penetrate human
tissue, are completely non-toxic (not metabolized), and offer the
potential for good freeze-dry preservation of tissue, albet at storage
temperatures somewhat below ambient.

I heard today that National Public Radio's Science Friday will address the
relationship between depression and internet use for those who enjoy
listening to Ira and his guests.  Tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. (maybe central time
but probably everywhere). If you miss it, you can listen to the discussion
at your leisure by going to the NPR web site (www.npr.org ?) and and listen
to the streaming audio version using real audio or something.

Cheers,

Can anyone tell me whether a 1966 film called Synthetic Pleasures is worth
checking out?  Xtros probably discussed it when it came out but I can't seem
to get the archives to work for me.

All money comes into existance as a debt. If all debts were repaid there
would be no money. For more on the debt engine read "Billions for Banksters"
at:-

http://www.webbindustries.com/spotlight/f_fr_art001.html

This story is good confirmation that all increases in money supplies are
borrowed from private banks who print it for a fee. Based on this logic it
pays the New World Odor crowd to promote violence in order to force the
starving into crime simply to generate money by providing the prison system.
Likewise when a ruler, say Clinton, orders that 16 billion be spent on the
"War on Drugs" this is not tax money but a further expansion of the money
supply. All debt is therefore a phony control mechanism and should be seen
as such and got rid of.

<sigh>  I was asking about "continuously adjusted summaries of all

me.  I asked you to explain this.  I see little use in continuously
adjusted summaries of all encompassing global material at the moment,
because I have no idea what you mean by that.  Did you miss that part?

Your view on how and why AI will be implemented will be my chance to have a
say in the making of new global politics?  Or will the AI itself and its
implementation be my chance to have a say in the making of global politics?
 You're not making any sense!  Please, I beg of you, for your sake and
mine, clearly identify your position in a way that doesn't allude to
another idea that you haven't already explained!

A web search for George Kelly turned up, as usual, nothing relevant to this

My irrelevant question is trying to pin down your position to something I
can understand.  Your apparent enmity to clarity has got me jinxed.  I
don't know "what point in the life cycle" to which I was referring: I was
trying to clarify YOUR position.

Again, I feel like you're answering the wrong question.  I don't understand
what kind of "reporting" you think would be going on.  You talk about forms
of abstraction and delving into bionomic areas, and then reporting bionomic
areas.  These are words I know, but the phrases you use are nonetheless
organized in a way that makes them completely opaque to me.  As far as I
can tell, it's a misuse of the term "report" to say that you report an
area.  Maybe you mean that they would report ON an area, but that still
leaves open the question as to what they would be reporting.  Temperature?
Weather?  Life signs?

Here's my essential problem: I have no idea what sort of system you're
proposing.  The impression I get is that it involves neural nets
intimately, but you haven't yet explained how, beyond the idea that the net
itself would be running the show.

Would this be better than what we have today?  Worse?  Do we have any
choice in the matter?  You might have answered these questions for
yourself, but I can't answer them for myself until you express more clearly
what form your system would take.  So far your explanations have been
mostly useless to me.

I have.  As I have noted, you're using words I know in contexts that make
no sense.  Search engines don't help there.  And though I would like for
you to connect the dots for me, I must admit that your apparent refusal to
do so is leading me to conclude that if you can't say it clearly then you
probably don't have all that much worth saying.  :(

This is an argument against fiat money, not money in general.  A gold
standard, for example, would not have this problem, and unless you're
attempting to tell me that gold I extract out of a mine I own is a debt to
somebody else, that pretty much solves that problem.

And this is simply preposterous.  Do you just make this stuff up as you go
along?

Funding the prison system doesn't help the government make money.  This is
a bizarre idea and I don't know where you got it from.

Banks, by their very nature, make new money, by loaning out more money than
they have.  The Fed simply tells them how much money they can loan out in
this way.  (Whether the Fed should exist or not is a point which I won't
get into here.)  The money thus created is the BANK's debt, however, not
mine: thats why if everybody tries to redeem their accounts at once,
(called a "run" on the bank) the bank gets screwed: it owes all of these
people money that it doesn't have.

Finally, increasing government spending does not cause an increase in the
money supply.  Increasing government spending causes an increase in nominal
GDP and by doing so causes an increase in the demand for money.  However,
since the Fed controls the money supply, this just pushes up the interest
rate, not the money supply.  If the Fed doesn't like that, they might
decide to increase the money supply to push the interest rate back down
again, but there is hardly a causal relationship here.

That's the average rate here in America, hence not so shocking. I haven't
seen any figures on divorce rates among the recently unemployed but I'll bet
it's even lower.

To J. Maxwell Long:

It so happens that my dissertation dealt with career indecision among
college students and my primary instrument of assessment was the cognitive
grid as developed by George Kelly.  And even with all this relatively
"inside" knowledge, I am having a most difficult time making sense out of
your posts. I'm sure they make sense in your construction of the universe.
It just seems to me that your writing style is so fraught with some sort of
personalized vocabulary, that it comes across as pretty ambiguous even to
someone like myself who is familiar with Personal Construct Psychology
(PCP).  Now I'm sure you're very intelligent and I don't doubt that you have
something valuable to contribute to this list, but I personally would
appreciate any effort on your part to communicate your ideas as
unambiguously as you are able.  Imagine that we're all college freshmen
attending your introductory course.

IOW, speak English!

BTW, when I find time I look forward to exploring INGRID.

Thank you,

Scott Badger, Ph.D.

Sorry, I meant that I would expect divorce rates to be *higher* among
recently unemployed americans.

It bothers me that some people on the list (I'm not thinking of Robin)
apparently have no empathy for the *ruinous experience* of those who get
thrown out of work, especially those over 40, and those who never get
started - those who are unemployed precisely because of the `rationality'
of the current economic protocols.  Robin's list is interesting, but I see
that he ends with insurance as a mitigating measure.  Decent societies have
that built-in, but it still doesn't touch the social/spiritual corrosion of
not having work or a meaningful time-binding, community-nurturing role in a
job-oriented culture.  

I find the throw-away rhetorical equation of structural unemployment with
`ill health' and `stupidity' rather disturbing.  (Of course, we *can* do a
lot about ill-health, on both the individual and the communal scales, and
already do.  Sadly, Australia, e.g., seems to be dismantling its
once-excellent public health system in the name of economic rationalism,
thereby locking plenty of jobless or retired people into a downward spiral.
 Sigh.)

I raised a preposterously large topic, and I think Robin's approach of
breaking it down into modules makes good sense.  den Otter's comments about
automation concur with my own basic utopian/dystopian estimate of the
imminent collapse of a jobs-based economy, but all he addresses is the
question of providing basic food, clothing, housing.  (And Robin can
explain why his precise model is economically hopeless anyway.)  But that
skirts one of the problems I see at the heart of the coming transition -
the malaise of anomie, far worse than anything the 1950s' sociologists ever
had nightmares about.  As people have remarked before, iirc, the black drug
culture of inner American cities is not just about getting money to live
on, it's about creating a meaningful social order, a working power
hierarchy, all that mafia Godfather stuff - and it apparently isn't working
all that well even in those terms.  One has the impression that Russia is
falling into just that kind of gangland sociology in default of anything
workable - even though the land is still there, the crops could still be
grown, the oil pumped, the machines cleaned and run...  Presumably *that*
is the evidence libertarians would point to, when arguing the failure of
systems allegedly run for the good of the collective.  I'd argue that it's
a transition from one gangsterism to another.  But that's another debate...

I have the promotional booklet and my recall of the review was that I would
watch the film given the opportunity. However when the opportunity arrived I had
better things to do.

Are you fumbling again? Did you mistype 1966 for 1996? For what it's worth I too
grimace at my mistakes but don't normally tell people that I am autistic and
suffer dyslexia or that I grew up as a creole wasp speaking in sort of a
bastardized quebecois. However, I heeded your advice and yesterday read George
Orwell's "Politics and the English Language" taking to heart his critique on
vagueness.

No doubt participation in illegal drug cultures does give participants,
and not only inner city blacks, a sense of purpose.  However, the
culture revolving around illegal commerce and associated violence
is almost entirely a creature of prohibition.  Note the lack of a
criminal culture based on the distribution of alcohol, caffeine,
and nicotine.  End crack/heroin/marijuana/etc. prohibition and
those involved will move on to other pursuits, some of them
constructive, just as those involved in the illegal alcohol trade
moved on after the end of that prohibition.  If you cannot see this
happening, you may consider questioning your racial prejudices.

I see unemployment as a) not much of a problem (the labor market
is quite tight in the US), b) easy to make less of a problem
(increase labor market flexibility), and c) impossible to do much
about in the long term if technology makes the skills of most or
all humans virtually worthless.

How can we address the alienation and purposelessness that appears
to run rampant, particularly through impoverished sectors of society?
As a culture, we could put less emphasis on material wealth.  We
could start by refusing to glamorize the rich and famous and the
products they promote.  We could also promote the idea that one
can find personal value in things other than material wealth --
wisdom, love, art, even several of the Extropian Principles.

Politically, we could adopt a "help the poor first" set of libertarian
policies -- end the drug war, eliminate taxes that fall hardest on
the poor (e.g. the payroll tax), and kill corporate pork -- before
even considering pushing for policies that are perceived as only
benefitting the rich or only harming the poor, such as eliminating
capital gains taxes or eliminating welfare.  Inequality may not be
morally wrong, but it is a major problem, if only because leftists
claim to have solutions, and that makes leftism very appealing to
many people.  Libertarians typically ignore or even celebrate
inequality.

As noted regarding the illegal drug culture, participating in a
culture does give one's life meaning.  Our society places far too
much emphasis on participating in culture vicariously through
consumer purchases and commercial entertainment.  Obviously poor
people have a hard time keeping up, although based on the number
of poor people I see who look as though they have spent a large
portion of their incomes becoming walking corporate billboards,
they really feel the need to try to keep up.  I would like to let
people know that participating in culture created from the bottom
up could be considerably more rewarding, empowering, and less
expensive than aping movie and sports stars.

I case you are not avare of t there's the internet movie database which list
probably any film made. I'm yet to find one that wasn't on it though

http://us.imdb.com/Title?Synthetic+Pleasures+(1995)

Didn't have much info about Sunthertic Pleasures though.

I have just finished a draft of the new version (3.0) of The Extropian
Principles. The number of principles has grown from five to seven and I've
made some alterations.

Please given me constructive criticism on this draft. The Principles define
Extropianism and serve as a focal point for others to figure out what we
are all about. Having numerous minds pick it over looking for ways of
improving it should produce a better result than if I do it alone.

This *is* a first draft of version 3.0, so there should be plenty of places
where the writing could be improved. My goal is to accurately and *clearly*
communicate our shared values and attitudes. Another goal in this version
is to slightly tone down the style so that it feels more sober, but without
losing all of its original spirit.

Feel free to use Foresight Institute's Critserver to make comments, or send
me mail, or post to the List. If you send me private mail, be sure to
address it to <more@extropy.org> since I'm in the process of dropping my
Primenet account.

Onward!

Gold is no longer a money standard and the Australian minister who wrote the
"billions for Bankers" article hadn't reached the conclusion that I have that
money can be replaced by a better neural net. Brutal Capitalism's police, secret
societies, drug dealers, gun runners, prostitutes, gamblers, loan sharks, and the
like, are the main ones standing to benefit from a continuation of money use.
They will be the loosers in an era of open information systems when their money
is no longer tolerated.

Try here. I ripped the following from an ADBUSTER'S website at:

http://www.adbusters.org/Articles/voodoo.html

But there's a glaring flaw in the expansionist argument. They haven't come up
with an accurate way of measuring the economic growth they keep talking about.
Their chief measure of growth is the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and it is
seriously flawed.

Consider:

When the Exxon Valdez spilled its load of oil into the Gulf of Alaska -- a dark
moment in recent American history -- America's GDP went up. (A lot of money was
spent on the cleanup, media coverage, ecological testing, legal fees, etc.) When
the Gulf War broke out, America's GDP went up again. Money changed hands. The
country became healthier. Indeed, every time there's a car accident or a newly
diagnosed cancer patient, whenever personal or societal catastrophies occur, the
GDP goes up and the economy.

Consider:

Walking, biking and mass transit contribute less to the GDP than using an
automobile. Trains contribute less than airplanes; an extra blanket or sweater
less than raising the thermostat; one-child families less than six-child
families; eating legumes less than eating beef; starting a vegetable garden less
than buying at the supermarket; staying home to raise your daughter less than
getting a part-time job at Wendy's. (Indeed, the GDP fails to assign any value at
all to unpaid or volunteer work. Work done by tens of millions of North Americans
simply does not show up on the radar. It's as if the work --  and the workers --
don't exist.)

GDP measures the goods but not the bads. That's why ecological economists
have developed their own measures of economic welfare. The three graphs on this
page show the GDPs of the US, UK and Germany all heading merrily upward from 1955
through the 1980s. However, a more accurate measure of economic progress, the
ISEW (Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare) developed by Herman Daly and John
Cobb in 1990, tells a very different story. When some of the bads, such as
pollution, depletion of non-renewable resources and car exhaust-related health
costs are factored in, a radically different picture of the economy emerges. The
US, German and UK economies all show no improvement in economic welfare since the
1970s. In fact, economic welfare levels off and starts falling dramatically in
each country.

The ISEW (and other economic progress indicators developed since) expose the
expansionists as a bunch of eager beavers without a well-considered business plan
--  pseudo scientists urging the world ahead before they themselves have clear
bearings. Neoclassical economists cling to their mathematical models like
children clinging to their teddy bears. They operate in a kind of academic
isolation that does not acknowledge the effects of their policies on real people.
They see data, not lives. Their world is the world of revealed preferences and
rational expectations, of perfectly voluntary exchange and negative
externalities that can be dismissed. Their world is not our world. Their world
does not exist.

The difference between science and economics, says F.E. Banks in Truth and
Economics, is that science aims at an understanding of the behaviour of nature,
while economics is involved with an understanding of models -- and many of these
models have no relation to any state of nature that has ever existed on this
planet, or any that is likely to exist between now and doomsday. The word that
comes to mind when confronted by these fantasies is fraud.

 Am I being foolish? Or is it for real, but this article is just plain
fascist.

  Hasn't it been a long standing issue that the jewish control the
banks and the money, and that their BIG world conspiracy is taking
over our peaceful democracies.

   Speaking about a peaceful and well doing democracy, the best
example seems to be nazi germany from 1935 to 1945, hey: they had no
debt, no unemployment, no trouble!!!

    Am I naive? Did everybody notice it and not me? Is spotlight a
real extremist newspaper?

     Manu.

Answering a question with a question is your style not mine. Take the simpler
proposition and see if it happens. Any AI that's better than what I foresee as a
global realization of a parallel implementation of Ingrid  (grids-in-motion) would
get my support so either way you'll have your chance. BTW, do you know how many AI
implementations has S&B scuttled? Why is Zapata making its move on the net?

Since I first used Ingrid, I can't express how hard it is to put my vaporware into
english. My brain now rapidly construes in grids and as yet has no user friendly
semantic interface, but don't worry, I'm getting closer to finding a way out of
this high dimensional dilemma.

I didn't ever say the net would be running the show; - you did. In practice the
adopted set of decentralized plans will be running the show and continuos feedback
will adjust those plans without today's delays and incompatibilities. Only private
plotting that keeps destroying the messengers can stop the development of a global
governance based on artificial intelligence.

Let's look at something else for a change. Caesar, Lincoln and Kennedy according
to what I know were assassinated for wanting to print debt free money; - a big
mistake. Will a simple treaty proposal calling for synaptic links to be mandatory
in all new software releases usher in a new round of assassinations? I am making
such a proposal right now.

It has become quite a dogma (on this list) that self organisation in
spontaneous systems is the best way to do most things. I can certainly
understand the fascination with this way of thinking.

It's a bit like watching neatly arranged domino pieces topple as they hit
each other. For me it's a bit like a boyhood fantasy if the world really
worked like this. "You start of a simple yet complex system and magically it
evolves into an optimal state, like intelligence."

It's the kind of fascination that makes some computergames so great.
"Boulder Dash", "Lemmings", "Command & Conquer", "Sim City" and others.

I do think though that it is in large part of the current trends in science
and culture with buzzwords like: complexity, Genetically evolved programs,
Neural nets, fractals etc. Math and the sciences har recently discovered
this way of thinking, and like the carpenter with a new hammer, everything
looks like a nail.

There is no doubt in my mind that spontanious order has it's place, but Iøm
equally certain that it's not a cureall for all of our complex problems.

Especially in politics and economics spontanious order and the invisible
hand is hot. But if the free market is the answer to most economical and
political problems, then it's a bit like saying that intelligence has little
value. If simple interconnected systems can perform wel in complex
enviroments why the have intelligence done so well until now.

Probably a company like Microsoft is proof that inside the free markets and
the spontanity there will be pockets of not so free markets. Big
organisations that are run top down by intelligent leaders.

This means that there at some levels will be free markets and at some levels
there will not.

Then my question is, at what level will spontanious order work best?

This story is an ineptly written, poorly argued, Christian-fundamentalist,

The author's qualifications for writing this economic analysis, from
"http://www.amprom.org/FOUNDER.htm" :

"Sheldon Emry was truly a pastor who fit the prophet Jeremiah's
description.Through his teachings many Christian Americans came to realize
just how meaningful world history really was. Because of his ability they
learned how to apply the Bible, God's Law, to their everyday lives and how
it should be applied to American government. It was through this special
God-given insight that Pastor Emry was able to show Americans the
importance of beinga Christian and a Patriot simultaneously. These
Americans were able to understand all these things because God Almighty
used Pastor Emry in the particular ministry He had called him to, to help
open their blinded eyes to their true identity as God's chosen people."

Hmmmmm. Could he be a somewhat biased author, with his own agenda, perhaps?

Microsoft is precisely the kind of organisation which couldn't exist in a
free market without tax-funded copyright enforcement.

I'm not a christian-fundamentalist, a racist or a simpleton and I didn't send
the URL to further this propaganda. Yes it could be better written and better
argued but I hope extropians can look further than obvious untruths to see
what else rings true. After all, the Net is full of truths hidden amongst
dialectics of this sort but if you aren't immune to it and it makes you sick
then you'll never be able to find out what one enemy knows about another.

Could you (or Robin) be more specific about this alleged hopelessness?
Do you mean that the streamlined government wouldn't get enough
income from taxes and business (such as gambling, drug sale &
other entertainment) to finance the construction and maintainance
of the automated factories? The beauty of the system is that it
more or less balances itself; better automata may push more and
more people out of the job market, but at the same time their
increased efficiency makes it possible to support more and more
people. The end of the line is a society where anything of any
importance is done by machines, while humans can live in greater
wealth than anyone today *without doing anything*. Of course,
by this time (and probably sooner) SI will emerge and cause
the Singularity, which makes further extrapolation pointless.

If a new system can provide all citizens of a country with more than
enough (cheap) wholesome food, good housing, quality clothing, 
medical care (automated health checks would beat most doctors
even today, and they are dramatically cheaper *and* more user-
friendly), and good sanitary facilities, then that would be *major*
advance, well worth the effort. Of course, people would then start
whining about other things (as most socialist systems have found
out in the '60s and '70s, an increased standard of living usually
leads to *more* crime, *more* protest and a greater general feeling
of discontent -- apparently many people can't handle the increase
in freedom too well). So, you'd throw in (almost) free entertainment,
mostly via television. Bread and games, some things never change.

To keep the society from being overrun by bored criminal youths,
you'd have to spice up the law. Fair yet tough, swift and sure. Of
course, state of the art surveillance would be put to good use all
over the place, both as deterrent and as hard evidence for speedy
trials. Again, quite affordable when mass produced. No need to
constantly watch everything, just search the central database
using the approximate date and location of the crime, and you'll
find your criminal.

Everyone can do what he wants, as long as no others are harmed.
Who fails to obey this simple, rational rule, gets removed from
society, and in the case of murder removed from existence. That
way one of the greatest weaknesses of the (western) socialist 
systems, a weak justice system, would be remedied.

You know, LEGO is going to introduce a computer interfaced version of LEGO
this fall for about $200. Here is an interesting challenge - building a

of the assembler problem would be revealed via this toy problem (pun

I understand that this wouldn't work with only two
people, but would the following be (roughly) a
correct way of explaining this idea?

Two people arguing over who gets a piece of land
in the current economy:


        A <----- communication ------> B


Two people arguing over who gets a piece of land
in the post-economy:


        |--------> Neural Net <--------|
        |                              |
        A                              B

In the second example A and B's communication is
filtered (or moderated) to become a useful part of
the neural net. In the first example the two would
have to come to some sort of agreement. In the
second example the decision making process happens
in the neural net, which is a product of A and B's
interaction. With a larger network of people,
communication between the two would join a neural
net built from the interactions between millions
of people and a far more complex decision making
process would take place.

I have to say that, from what I understand, I like
the idea. But it's incredibly hard to imagine such
a system being implemented.

Yes perhaps... but there you are talking about an idealised society. I'm
more interrested in practical solutions. I don't think that we will se an
ideal free market for a long time. Perhaps never. The world isn't the USA
and most countries has massive intervention from governments.

This is not likely to change for a long time.

This is wrong.  The nominal GDP is a measure of growth, but it is not the
only one, or even the most important.  Economists look at nominal GDP, the
price level (which is usually inflating) and investment.  We can get a good
idea as to how good the economy is doing by looking at people's spending
power, GDP/price level.  Alternately, we can see how sustainable our
economy is by looking at how much people are investing, and by observing
the price of futures.

America's GDP is affected by a lot of factors.  Do you have any evidence

Here you make the mistake that other economists make of confusing current
GDP for economic efficiency.  Fortunately, responsible economists don't
make this mistake.

Let's look at some of these examples.  Walking vs. driving, for example.
For economists, if people want to drive then they're better off when
they're able to drive.  Now let's suppose that you're trying to choose
between walking or driving when you can afford both.  Well, if you choose
to drive, you consume more.  This increases current GDP through
consumption: it increases demand for cars slightly, increasing the standard
of living for those who make cars, etc.

But what happens when you choose to save your money and walk?  Do you just
bury that wealth in a hole where it never comes out again?  Obviously not.
If you have the money, you will either save it so you can consume something
else (maybe you're saving up for a new air conditioner instead! ;) ) or you
will simply save it in the bank, where it will earn interest.  This is not
an economic bad, because when the bank's got it, the bank will INVEST it,
and investment leads to economic growth through the creation of new
capital.  An economy which one day decided it would completely cease
investing and just spend all of its money today would have an amazing GDP
this quarter, but would find themselves in the deepest poverty in the
coming years, as machinery broke down, homelessness occurred, demand
slumped, etc.

In other words, walking instead of biking doesn't hurt the economy one bit,
because you're USING that money to consume something else or paying someone
else (in this case, the bank,) to invest it.  Either way it's an economic
good for neoclassical economists.

Anyway, I presume that this was meant to answer my question as to how
spending money on prisons makes money for the government.  Of course, it
doesn't.  Government spending today has a crowding out effect, causing
investment to decrease.  And though government spending does increase GDP
and thus tax revenues, it does not pay for itself, nor do neoclassical
economists believe that it does.  Reagan thought that it would; he was
obviously wrong.

>(Indeed, the GDP fails to assign any value at
>all to unpaid or volunteer work. Work done by tens of millions of North
Americans

In volunteer work, money doesn't change hands.  It's often unofficial.  In
fact, almost everything that's done voluntarily is unofficial.  Economists
couldn't even begin to measure the extent of volunteer work even if they
wanted to.  They can measure charity donations, however, and one thing we
do notice is that, like all other forms of consumption, it increases as
spending power rises.

Of course it does.  When you get to choose how much a bad is worth, you can
make the graph look like anything you want it to.

Here's why the arguments from sustainability are wrong:  Suppose we were
about to run out of something important.  Well, in that case, the price
would certainly rise, as demand for it would remain constant while supply
shriveled.  You'd be able to make a killing off of this by buying some of
that resource now, saving it, and then selling it at a huge profit later on.

Today we have another system which simplifies matters: instead of buying
today, you can buy a future contract.  You can make an agreement with
somebody who owns some of the valuable resource that they will sell it to
you at a specified price some number of years from now.  If the market
thinks the price of the good will go down in the future or remain constant,
you can offer a future contract at only a little bit higher than what they
think it is and still make a killing.  They'll buy it because they think
they'll be able to sell it to you above its market value; you'll buy it
because you know that you'll be buying it for way less than market value.

It's like gambling, only it relies on real observable data to get its price
level.  And, as I keep emphasizing, there's a huge incentive to find out
precisely what the future price level will be.

You don't even have to wait until we run out of the resource to make money.
 As soon as people figure out what's going on and that resource depletion
is imminent, the market will revalue the future price of your resource: you
can then just sell the futures you bought to others and make a killing
*today*.

By buying futures today, environmental groups would no longer have to rely
on charity to fund their goals.  They would make so much money off of their
profits that they'd easily afford to make the changes in the political
system they have so long desired.

They do not.  No one has.  The future price of natural resources remains
low, despite the fact there there is a huge financial incentive to get this
value exactly right.  If the environmentalists insist that the financial
types are missing something important, then they should put their money
where their mouths are and buy futures.

They don't, so I don't believe them.

In my opinion, extropianism is not an ideology or an economic system
like capitalism or communism.  It is a personal philosophy.

Rather then asking what kinds of macro-economic changes extropianism
would advise in order to solve a global problem, it is more appropriate
to ask how extropianism advises us to structure our own lives to avoid
problems of structural unemployment.

In that sense, extropian principles like boundless expansion,
self transformation, dynamic optimism, etc., offer many suggestions.
Exploit new technology, look ahead of the curve, remain flexible, don't
get stuck in ruts, etc.  Someone who commits to these principles is
going to be much less likely to find themselves becoming obsolete than
the average person.

I didn't accuse you of being any of those things, and I am happy to believe
you when you say you are none of them, and happy to apologize if I gave any
other impression of you.

The issue, it seems to me, is that I, without a great deal of academic
economic knowledge, find it impossible to take information from such a
tract with any degree of confidence in its reliability or worth. Since I do
not find myself in a position to self-critique the piece I can only doubt
its veracity based on its subtext and the author's (lack of) credentials.
Thus, as piece intended to support your argument, I suspect that for people
like me it is misleading, whilst for people with a pre-existing economic
background it is risible.

That said, the most important piece of this mail is my apology to you, if
any have considered my earlier post to be attributing very undesirable
attributes to you. That was never my intention.

One more point:

The biggest problem most people have with extropianism is its voluntary
nature.  The idea of a society based not on coercion and force but on
cooperation is anathema.  A while back I wrote:

: It's ironic.  We tell people that 30 years from now everyone will turn
: into an immortal superman, and they say ho hum.  But if you suggest
: that somebody ought to be able to work for less than the minimum wage,
: all hell breaks loose.

Damien's question seems to be leading into the same old Liberatarian vs
Statist argument which happens over and over and over again on the net
until we are all thoroughly sick of it.  Do we have to rehash it here?

Since it looks like we've decided to ditch BEST DO IT SO in this version
(BIST DO IT SO SORT doesn't have the same ring to it ;) ), now seems like a
good time to raise questions as to whether it should be called Dynamic
Optimism or something else.  I happen to prefer Critical Optimism, as it
comes across a lot more clearly than Dynamic Optimism, which I consistently
have to explain.

Also, a style note: it looks like number 7, Rational Thinking, is in a
smaller font in the table of contents than the rest of the principles.
Since, presumably, we would consider this just as important as the other
principles, it should have the same heading level.  :)

And while I'm on this topic, I'd like to say a little bit about Rational
Thinking.  I like rational thinking, but I can't say that without giving a
little disclaimer, one which I didn't see in the principles.

When I toss a ball to you, your brain solves a differential equation so
that it can move your hands to the right place to catch it.  Children as
young as five can do this.  This is not to say, however, that children as
young as five are ready to learn calculus, but that the brain is capable of
reaching correct rational conclusions without being conscious of the
process required to reach it.

When we say that someone has solved a problem instinctively, that doesn't
mean that they've done it wrong, nor does it mean that they weren't being
rational (or even non-rational) as they were doing it.  Rather the
difference is simply that the process by which they solved the problem is
unknown, even to the thinker.

Why might this sort of thinking be valuable?  Why not consciously work out
all of your conclusions, which would add to clarity of thought and avoid
confusion?  Of course, instinct is often a lot faster than the meticulous
layers of thought required to solve problems rationally and explicitly.
But more importantly, instinct may ultimately be the only way by which we
can "think outside the box," as it is often called: to break free of old
paradigms and to think about a problem in a new way.  I think that if
Extropians were to reject instinct as a mental tool we would have far more
to lose than to gain.

Rational thinkers of the past have often rejected the line of reasoning I
present above; today, in the common vocabulary, "rational thinking" is
believed to be contradictory to instinctive problem solving; without making
explicit disclaimers like the one I gave above, I can think of no way to
make it clear that Extropians welcome instinct as a mental tool, but insist
that it must also be supplemented by a conscious criticism of our own ideas.

In the same vein, while I happen to think that self-ownership is a good
idea, I consider it only extrinsicly useful.  If a new form of neural net
*were* to make ownership of all kinds obsolete while satisfying supply and
demand in a manner better than capitalism ever could, then I would support
it.  As such, I hesitate to consider it a principle.  Yes, I understand
that these principles are themselves open to criticism and change, but at
the same time I can't even begin to imagine a situation under which I would
reject boundless improvement (a good word change!), for example.
Similarly, as far as I can tell, boundless expansion would be impossible
without self transformation, a dynamic form of optimism, intelligent
technology and spontaneous order.

In short, I hesitate to include self ownership on the list of principles
because, I can imagine a situation in which the concept would go obsolete.
In contrast, I do not ever anticipate that dynamic optimism will become
obsolete.

Similarly, the spontaneous order section has been rewritten as a much
stronger affirmation of capitalism than I saw in v2.6.  As anybody who has
read many of my posts know, I think capitalism is a great idea; but it
isn't necessarily the best idea.  On the other hand, I DON'T anticipate a
better system of resource allocation that doesn't directly make use of
spontaneous order.  That's why I think spontaneous order should be a
principle, but capitalism shouldn't, nor should the idea of spontaneous
order become so strongly linked to capitalism as to make the ideas
indistinguishable.

That's all for now.

I'm looking for the following article: "Extropia", 8 Extropy Magazine 35 
(Winter 1991-92). So far I've only found a dead(?) link at T.0. Morrow's
website. Is this article available online somewhere?

While looking, I did find the "Extropia -- An E-zine for the 20th Century
Cyborg" by Selena Sol, a strange blend of transhuman ideas and New Age
(or somthing). Perhaps this is the fabled "Dark Side", the men in black 
latex with the home-made mice (X-Y pointers, not small fluffy rodents) 
attached to their body?

If you include this disclaimer you'll need to add another disclaimer
to cover the natural born instincts that are in direct conflict of
interest with our goals.  This is getting messy.

Maybe its just nostalgia, but I remember liking one of the early (1.?)
versions of the principles more than any that has come since.  I wish
I would have saved it.  What is an effective way to edit a document
without getting the phenomena of "over editing"?

Too true...  :(  Maybe this topic would be best covered in Dynamic Optimism
or something:  "In the end, it doesn't matter what particular mental
construct you use to solve problems, (Extropians use many different kinds
and seek out new ones,) so long as they reach correct and useful
conclusions."  Thoughts?

Well, keeping old copies, obviously.  :)  I'm not sure where they are, but
I'm pretty sure old versions are still around somewhere...

Many-worlds is deterministic, and accepts cause-and-effect.  The scientist
opens the box containing Schroedinger's cat and that *causes* the worlds to
split, then and there.

Here's relevant quotes from the FAQ you sent me:

***********

Q8   When does Schrodinger's cat split?
     ----------------------------------
Consider Schrodinger's cat.  A cat is placed in a sealed box with a
device that releases a lethal does of cyanide if a certain radioactive
decay is detected.  For simplicity we'll imagine that the box, whilst
closed, completely isolates the cat from its environment.  After a while
an investigator opens the box to see if the cat is alive or dead. 
According to the Copenhagen Interpretation the cat was neither alive nor
dead until the box was opened, whereupon the wavefunction of the cat
collapsed into one of the two alternatives (alive or dead cat).  The
paradox, according to Schrodinger, is that the cat presumably knew if
it was alive *before* the box was opened.  According to many-worlds the
device was split into two states (cyanide released or not) by the
radioactive decay, which is a thermodynamically irreversible process
(See "When do worlds split?" and "Why do worlds split?").  As the
cyanide/no-cyanide interacts with the cat the cat is split into two
states (dead or alive).  From the surviving cat's point of view it
occupies a different world from its deceased copy.  The onlooker is
split into two copies only when the box is opened and they are altered
by the states of the cat.

The cat splits when the device is triggered, irreversibly.  The
investigator splits when they open the box.  The alive cat has no idea
that investigator has split, any more than it is aware that there is a
dead cat in the neighbouring split-off world.  The investigator can
deduce, after the event, by examining the cyanide mechanism, or the
cat's memory, that the cat split prior to opening the box.

[snip]

Q19  Do worlds differentiate or split?
     ---------------------------------
Can we regard the separate worlds that result from a measurement-like
interaction (See "What is a measurement?") as having previous existed
distinctly and merely differentiated, rather than the interaction as
having split one world into many?  This is definitely not permissable
in many-worlds or any theory of quantum theory consistent with
experiment.  Worlds do not exist in a quantum superposition
independently of each other before they decohere or split.  The
splitting is a physical process, grounded in the dynamical evolution of
the wave vector, not a matter of philosophical, linguistic or mental
convenience (see "Why do worlds split?" and "When do worlds split?") 
If you try to treat the worlds as pre-existing and separate then the
maths and probabilistic behaviour all comes out wrong.  Also the
differentiation theory isn't deterministic, in contradiction to the wave
equations which are deterministic, since many-minds says that:

  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBBBBBB         --------------&#62; time
                                         (Worlds differentiate)
  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCCCCCCCCC

occurs, rather than:
                 BBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
                B
  AAAAAAAAAAAAAA                         (Worlds split)
                C
                 CCCCCCCCCCCCCCC

according to many-worlds.

This false differentiation model, at the mental level, seems favoured
by adherents of many-minds.  (See "What is many-minds?")

Q20  What is many-minds?
     ------------------
Many-minds proposes, as an extra fundamental axiom, that an infinity of
separate minds or mental states be associated with each single brain
state.  When the single physical brain state is split into a quantum
superposition by a measurement (See "What is a measurement?") the
associated infinity of minds are thought of as differentiating rather
than splitting.  The motivation for this brain-mind dichotomy seems
purely to avoid talk of minds splitting and talk instead about the
differentiation of pre-existing separate mental states.  There is no
physical basis for this interpretation, which is incapable of an
operational definition.  Indeed the differentiation model for physical
systems is specifically not permitted in many-worlds.  Many-minds seems
to be proposing that minds follow different rules than matter.  (See "Do
worlds differentiate or split?")

In many-minds the role of the conscious observer is accorded special
status, with its fundamental axiom about infinities of pre-existing
minds, and as such is philosophically opposed to many-worlds, which
seeks to remove the observer from any privileged role in physics. 
(Many-minds was co-invented by David Albert, who has, apparently, since
abandoned it.  See Scientific American July 1992 page 80 and contrast
with Albert's April '94 Scientific American article.)

The two theories must not be confused.

What's more, unless you're proposing massively improbable violations of
thermodynamic laws, m-w doesn't allow for magicians: the worlds will remain
so far split that there is no chance that they will fuse in any way a
magician could use reliably.  Similarly, no magician in the future can
influence events in the past using many-worlds.

I'm actually beginning to understand you here, but not quite.  Does an AI
need *all* of our information in order to run a neuronomy?  Or just lots?
Why isn't lots sufficient?

>Why do I feel that your agenda is S&B's?

The Skull and Bones building is about a block away from where I live here
at Yale.  It is closed to outsiders.  Though you have no reason to believe
me, I happen to be fundamentally opposed to secret societies and their ilk,
for reasons that don't relate to this conversation.

To begin with, I didn't assert that you answered questions with questions,
so I don't understand why you're raising this point.  Moreover, this is an
abuse of the phrase.  I have replied to almost all of your questions with a
very particular question:  "I didn't understand your question.  Would you
please explain it?"

I don't know about *any* AI implementations that S&B has scuttled.  They're
a secret society, for crying out loud!  They make it their prime objective
to prevent me (and you) from finding out about stuff like this.  :)

>Why is Zapata making its move on the net?

Cursed if I know.  A search for "zapata AND conspiracy" turned up nothing.  ;)

Anyway, if I were to take a wild flaming guess: it's because they think
that's where the money is.

>Try "George Kelly Ingrid" or better still search for a course on how to

I do *plenty* for myself.  There's a limited amount of effort I'm willing
to exert in order to understand what you happen to think, however.  :)

Anyway, if I follow you correctly, Ingrid is an attempt to automate and
coordinate the distribution of personal construct grids, yes?  In doing so,
a simply written program could coordinate the whole of human behavior if it
had access to enough/ the right grids.  Am I on the right track?

I can see how this would pose problems. :)  Might I reccomend Strunk &
White's _Elements of Style_?  The rules laid out there are a little bit too
difficult for most of today's AI but aren't too difficult for most people I
know.

You continue to assert that AI needs all the info, or as much as possible
in order to work.  We humans function alright (if suboptimally) with
incomplete information; it seems to me that an AI that required complete
information before it would work would be effectively crippled, spending
its time on a quixotic quest for all the information it needs to solve the
problem.

Indeed, I'm now beginning to see some of those paralells between capitalism
and thermodynamics that Clark was alluding to: simply the act of trying to
find out everything costs money; trying to improve the efficiency of the
whole economy by observing the whole economy and dictating its behavior
leads to less efficiency than just letting the people organize themselves
and remaining in rational ignorance.

The link to assassination politics on this page is broken...  Do you know

As to the point about assassinations, I'd not heard this particular theory

I'll second that.  I especially find the earlier version of the paper on
"Dynamic Optimism" to be far superior to the present one.  In fact, I was
very happy that I kept my old copy, as I would us it exclusively as a way
to introduce people to extropian principles... unfortunately the last
person I gave it to never gave it back!

I think the "new is better" meme is particularly dangerous for an
extropian mind.  I know I fall prey to it every once and a while. ;-)

Subject: Hippocampus and independent component analysis


I would like to announce the availability of a new paper on
the functional model of the hippocampus. The model fits
smoothly the overall anatomical structure and its two-phase
operational mode. The model is built on two basic postulates:
(1) the entorhinal-hippocampal loop serves as a control
    loop with control errors initiating plastic changes
    in the hippocampus and
(2) the hippocampal output develops independent components
    in the entorhinal cortex

The paper

        AUTHOR:   Andras Lorincz
        TITLE:    Forming independent components via temporal
                  locking of reconstruction architectures:
                  a functional model of the hippocampus
        JOURNAL:  Biological Cybernetics (in press)

may be obtained from:

http://iserv.iki.kfki.hu/New/pub.html


Abstract:

The assumption is made that the formulation of relations as
independent components (IC) is a main feature of computations
accomplished by the brain.  Further, it is assumed that memory traces
made of non-orthonormal ICs make use of feedback architectures to form
internal representations. Feedback then leads to delays and delays in
cortical processing form an obstacle to this relational processing.
The problem of delay compensation is formulated as a speed-field tracking
task and is solved by a novel control architecture. It is shown that in
addition to delay compensation the control architecture can also shape
long term memories to hold independent components if a two-phase
operation mode is assumed. Features such as a trisynaptic loop and
a recurrent collateral structure at the second stage of that loop emerge
in a natural fashion. Based on these properties a functional model of the
hippocampal loop is constructed.

That wasn't my intention.  I had in the back of my mind the observation (by
Anders?) that the most promising way to solve an anthropogenic global
warming crisis would be to treat it as a technical issue rather than a
moral one.  (Reserving the possibility, in my view, that the technical
issues might be modulated critically by moral choices made in the light of
non-technical values.)  

I hoped that the smart people here might have some interesting things to
suggest about the various projectable paths from the current productive and
distributive technologies (including economic policy theories) to a sheaf
of likely outcomes as we move into an increasingly automated and then
AI/assembler-driven economy.  Robin's list of sub-topics might well be the
way to start analysing the issues involved.  Taking such a technical tack
might help keep the discussion clear of intractable ideological disputes.

But the technical issues still require - in my view - an unflagging
awareness that the components of the algorithms we're playing with are
human beings, many of them unconscionably constrained and hurting already
and likely to become more so as time passes.  I want to find ways to help
people live spiritually rich (you know what I mean), non-violent,
non-self-destructive lives, if it's possible, in a world where many of them
are going to be structurally excluded from the activities that
traditionallly have given life meaning.

They're claiming that since psychological state at the beginning did not
influence internet use but internet use did influence later psychological
state
then interent usage caused psychological state, not the other way around.
But, since they're comparing two correlations, the appropriate test is whether
the two correlations are statistically different.  Even if the two
correlations are
sampled from the same distribution, you will frequently find one significant
and the other not when the difference is marginally significant.

Well, they're not comparing internet users to non-users.  They're comparing
heavy users to light users, and the scientists didn't determine that; each 
participant determined their own usage.  So conclusions on causation on that
basis are just post hoc, ergo propter hoc.

In an attempt to make up for the time of list members I have wasted

improve someone else's use of the net as well.

<http://www.northernlight.com/> performs reasonable web searches,
and also searches "4 million articles from over 4,500 journals,
books, magazines, databases and newswires."

For queries producing large numbers of matching pages,
<http://google.stanford.edu/> often does a better job of finding
relevant items.  Apparently it does this by examining the content
of pages linked to in addition to the content of the page in question
when it determines how to rank search results.  Google also uses
Linux on relatively low end hardware without bogging down.

Only my gut feeling that 'national debt' results from the financing of an

Unfortunately humans consider transactional savings as a reduction in costs, which
under competitive pressure currently translates into a lower selling price for
their output. Because capitalism is very inefficient at working out how much a
person needs to make it through life, in the end the trap is complete and the
person without overheads ends up working for free. But I ask you to consider what
happens when such a person creates for free the software that could upload the
economy.

You might consider such a person to be a failure, but there is a growing army of
such techno-failures just waiting for a broader based system. This mass of human
flesh does not simply lay down and die but force feeds another kind amathematical
logic back into the system to bend the status quo to their needs. As a potential
uploader I faced this question early on and opted to fight erstwhile genocidal
governments on their own terms.

No doubt my actions now will cause that quark thingy to busily stitch up all sorts
of histories to disable my attack, on the other hand, if it's possible to upload a
global economy into a neural net, it should be a snap to upload a human brain
using similar software.

Under my concept of a more efficient neural net than capitalism, one in which the
system of grading scales is capable of creating feedback loops for all sorts of
activities, be it for oil exploration or volunteer work, the effect will be to
create a bigger net than capitalism is capable of on its own. It doesn't have to
be all encompassing from the start but the potential is there and this is why such
a net will initially use synthetic data to 'second guess' and flush out hidden
elements.

But the FAQ didn't cover the possibility of that quark-like thingy vibrating
backwards and forwards across time which would be quite a natural addition to our
physical laws if it were ever accepted. As a counterpoint it conjures up a good
explanation in my mind that because I mobilized on the probability of winning my
war against capitalism, histories were set in motion which gave my country, New
Zealand, one of the most dictatorial right wing (fascist) governments in the world
today.

Ingrid is capable of extracting meaning from not only personal constructs but from
such a vast spectrum of subjective and objective data that next to it the price
system would seem tiny. Could a price system run a muscle or artificial vision or
a global government? I bet Ingrid can handle all this and what's more all the
interpretation is similar. Take SPSS for example, locked up as it is with
capitalistic restrictions, at its top end it can verify what Ingrid does but I
know how easy it would be for me to get Ingrid gently blended into the background
of every computer on the planet, by first getting it used in government; - not as
an aid to conduct studies but as a way to link all studies and then fold in
democracy then capitalism.

Ah, if only it weren't for that quark thingy making things tough for me, I'd be at
the ending of the age of hypothesis, instead of being consigned to the sideshows
of history.

In most respects such a system of consolidated measurements must leave
open the possibility that Independent Components can instinctively rise
to the surface. Other than that you would find that the upfront
transaction costs would make it sensible to 'capitalize' more lifetime
accounts than pay per view type of transactions. In the end a system of
anti-capitalism would evolve whereby the settlement of complaints would
account for 'aprofit' whereby one might score a contribution high and
others score it low. If you were to loose out in such a situation there
would be no actual settlement but the independence of your component
would be subsumed and may end up as a disquieted memory in the net.

Sheesh, I wish I could resist those big words. As the two birds on the
phone line were overheard to say. "Don't they tickle your feet?!"

How on earth can a simple calculation determine if something is
"Sustainable" or not? What new oil reserves will we find?  What new
Tungsten deposits will be discovered?  How fast will the demand for
Molybdenum  grow? What new technological breakthroughs will be made?
Nobody knows, and to pretend we do by issuing a precise figure and
giving it the pretentious name "ISEW" is ridiculous.

It GTE's worse. The ISEW includes data about income distribution and
yes the way income is distributed is objective, but the ISEW
subjectively determines that any variation from pure equality is bad
and it puts a precise figure on exactly how bad.

ISEW babbles about environmental damage but again, this is purely a
matter of personal taste.  The amount of money you would be willing to
pay to live in a world that had .01% less Sulfur Dioxide in the air
would probably be different from what I would pay.

I know I haven't convinced you and so you have an opportunity to prove
me wrong and have vengeance against all those evil capitalists by
becoming richer than any of them, just take your life savings and
invest it. You know how wonderful the ISEW is and how it can magically
tell when a resource will run out and what new discoveries will be
made, this gives you a huge head start over the competition because
most money managers  think GNP is an objective and effective
measure of wealth and they think the ISEW is crap.  Let's see you put
your money where your mouth is, and when you become richer than Bill
Gates I'll admit you're right.

Eh? Russian communism was in the end exposed as a set of seven private
corporations running slaves on the gold standard and headquartered in
Sweden, however your cynicism is noted.

The above sort of data fusion has no central authority. This type of
leveraging of the infosphere is already seen as an inevitable omnisensorial
military command. The military realize by 2025 there can no longer be any
centralized response. What, I say, needs to happen is for the population to
structure their response via a global neural net so that it too will be
absorbed and noticed by the military as the people's conscience thus
neutralizing the military; - not dissipated and pissed up against the wall
as currently happens to our collective electronic voice.

Over time I think such a system can be very quick to react with something
like an instinctive response when something out of the blue occurs but
otherwise the neural nets will stabilize not become a demarchy.

Sorry, I haven't even looked at this ISEW thing and wouldn't intend to look at
any system that uses capitalism's paper money as a circular measurement. I say
again use an Ingrid system that separates all elements into clusters so that
there can be no value for each element on any particular scale greater than 5
nor lower than 1 and you will automatically create a spontaneous self-adjusting
global AI. We have the computing power right now and what I'm saying can be
modeled. Are you against designing such an economic model and putting it through
its paces?

If you know nothing about it then why did you use it to try to prop up
your argument? I have found that it's sometimes nice to have some idea
of what the hell you're talking about.

"Yes, yes, I'm sure that's true" he said soothingly as he slowly

Ken's sadly humorous rant about the bureaucratic nightmare of getting a
fictitious business name reflects some recent experience I had with Texas'
drivers' license authority, the Department of Public Safety (a name with
chilling parallels to the Committee for Public Safety in the French
Revolution).  After wasting many hours to conclude the nine minute transaction
of renewing my driver's license, I could only conclude that such galling
inefficiency was the result of monopoly power.  In the case of the DPS, it's
ARMED monopoly power.  

I asked the woman who finally did accept the paper work for my license whether
the half-day I wasted at the DPS office was typical.  I was informed that, no,
it was actually a "light" day.  Most days were worse.  I asked her whether
other people had ever made the observation that the office's procedures seemed
inefficient.  She responded that yes, it was a common observation but "What
people don't understand is that driving is a privilege, not a right."

Rather than continue the dialogue, I counted myself lucky to have gotten
through the ordeal and left, more confirmed than ever in my opinion that a
little competition would be a good tonic to most ills of government
inefficiency.

And don't forget a *lot* of automation! A well-programmed computer
is a joy forever. How I love those train/bus ticket machines, for example; 
always ready to serve you without a murmur. If only everything were so 
efficient...

My PC crashed since getting the refs and my files melted. Write to this
email address to get the archival sources directly from the researcher.
Say I sent you. While you're at it ask what involvement the husband of
Ayn Rand had with this setup because I have a vague recollection the
reference was from the same source.

A diagnosis is way different from a cure. If I see a fireman using water
to put out a dangerous fire, one in which water is likely to cause further
problems, I don't offer to pass the bucket as that would only make matters
worse.

Can't any of you who are being demeaning toward my proposition find it
reasonable to understand that I'm talking about replacing existing
'values' with electronically mediated 'meanings'. It's one thing to talk
about the meaning of values but to me it seems superfluous to talk about
the value of meaning. All your economic arguments of exchange and wealth
can be solved in the context of associated meanings which is what the
Ingrid software handles superbly. Ask any statistician. Really!

Not for me - the browser scroller showed nothing like that and now the
whole link is obsolete. I am really interested in finding more about this
willingness of Wall St to commit suicide. If you have the article in your
history could you forward it pleeeease?

Whereas the U.N. articles of declaration clause 29.3 states roughly that
nothing can ever be put up for discussion that seeks to disolve the U.N.,
I think it's good that mature systems know how to respond when their
number's up.

Why not use electronic ink and make it the same dimensions and initial face
value as a US dollar bill but let it retain the history and the meanings of the
transactions that it was used for. If you keep it away from static and keep it
in an A.C.I.D. free environment, it won't come back to haunt you.

Yeah, I know Kennedy's E.O. 11110 is cited here by just another bunch of patriotic
right wing christian militia conspiracy fools. Now, these fools have a grievance,
they are organized and are fighting back, however they do not have my solution of
electronically mediated meanings. They still want to use money and can't get over
their sink or swim zero-sum mentality. These people are not friendly towards my
propositions. As well, the dissembling put forward by supporters of the FED is
without doubt an effective way of silencing dissent and in this rare example of a
death struggle, where my enemies enemy is my enemy, both sides should receive pity
not schadenfreude, or do you reserve that only for me?

That was wonderfully ungracious, but thanks anyway, Mike.

I had supposed that a white man with a black `significant other', like
Mike, would understand at a gut level how sickening such an implication
would be, even if it were unintentional, and hasten with some anxiety to
correct the erroneous impression.

Perhaps the time and bandwidth taken by such exchanges are wasted, but I
view them as a small price for maintaining civility on the list.

The electric trams in Melbourne, which were once served by friendly
fare-collecting conductors who helped little old ladies and mothers with
prams and somehow caused thugs and noisy children to control themselves
just by their presence, recently shifted to on-board ticket machines and
validators.  Both kinds of machines, which took an extraordinary amount of
time to develop and bring on line, are now plagued with problems (unlike
those in many other cities and countries; maybe it's the ozone hole).  The
neatest detail is that the ticket machines have been placed along the side
of the tram (so that users must stand side-on to the forward motion of the
often-jolting tram) and right next to the well of the central egress,
causing off-balance old patrons and baby-clutching mothers to tumble to
their doom as they try to key in their choice of ticket and feed in their
coins with one hand.  Technology cannot defeat stupidity.  (And of course,
without the human conductors roaming up and down the tram and catching
their eye, most travellers simply avoid buying or validating their tickets;
tragedy of the commons, again.  There is a squad of inspectors, but as a
kid told me the other day, `There's heaps of strategies'...)

There is a fundamental "law" about growth in the public sector called
Parkinson law. It says something in the line of: "Every public official will
try to raise his own status by hiring subordinates" The conclusion of that
is that government organs will keep growing.

What is missing is a negative feedback loop.

I once got the idea that there is a need for a new "organ" whos sole
responsibility is to analyze the net worth of the other governement organs
and then cut down on the inefficient ones. That way growth should be kept in
bay. And if this new govt. organ got really big, the rest of government
would be really small.

:-) Problem solved....

Well stated. Except I'd replace
/ignorance/ with /innocence/
in the last sentence, because scientists
do not usually,
generally, or habitually ignore
anything. They do
demonstrate an innocence about honest
questions, and from
what I've read of Einstein's life,
sometimes about daily
life as well.

Right, I forgot about that. Billions of
tax dollars fund
political science (particularly
"politically correct"
political science). <g>

No doubt we can agree (okay, this has
not much to do with
it) that we can build better roads with
science than with
anti-science. Anyway, corporate
scientific research labs
(Bell Labs, ADM, Genentech, Lilly
pharmaceuticals, GE, etc.)
get most of their funding from real
profits that they
generate themselves.

I brought up the subject of taxes, not
because of anything
to do with institutional funding at
taxpayer expense, but
because I view science as productive,
creative, practical,
truthful, and capable of generating
taxable wealth (very
extropian, that). I think that overall,
science pays more
taxes than it receives, especially if we
include goods and
services that scientific research has
made possible.
Contrariwise, organized religiosity
receives more via its
tax-free status than it has ever had the
means to pay back.

N.B.: Does the fact that some
governments deem it worthy of
funding contribute to the validity of
science? Well...
governments that hire religious fanatic
terrorists instead
of rocket scientists to provide
themselves with military
defense may not think so. Personally, I
view any paradigm
(religious, philosophical, aesthetic,
educational, economic,
social, whatever) so delelict that it
requires a special tax
exemption in order to continue, just a
waste of time.

We had to make a truckload of (astute)
assumptions to arrive here. I enjoyed
the ride. But it
doesn't matter, because God does not
exist (as his brother, I should know
<g>). This explains how
God can let this happen. He can let
anything happen. He doesn't exist. God
can have whatever
attributes any hallucinating brain
assigns to God.

As you probably know, people invented
God so that they could continue their
lives without the stress
involved in recognizing and
acknowledging their own mortality...
their own eventual dive into
oblivion. We can easily understand the
motive of belief in the supernatural.
When reason settles
into a transient life form, it has an
unsettling effect. Belief systems
assuage the discomfort of
cognitive dissonance.

Anyway, I appreciate your compelling
argument against the nonexistant God. At
the age of twelve,
many savvy kids figure out that if the
universe needs God to create it, then
God needs something to
create God.

The diety functions as a father-figure
for people who crave attention from
daddy. Sadly, too many
real live daddies don't even want to
think about attending to this hunger for
father love.

BTW, if we define God as the set of
genetic algorithms and self-organization
that results in complex
life forms and the universe they
inhabit, then God becomes more
intricate, but not more ethical.
Which means that we cannot blame the God
of self-organization and genetic
algorithms for permitting
(or, more significantly, for creating)
the cruelty in life. We should rather
thank God for rendering
us able to

I meant ON. Let's see if I can make this clearer. For a thousand years say,
Capitalism gets its reporting structure into place, right? Ok, now I propose a
neuronomy without visible means of support structures, but a neuronomy is like an
opposition government that hasn't ever governed and doesn't know the truth of the
situation. In starting to discuss what a neuronomy is capable of can it be taken
for granted that none of the structure can be in place before it is modeled? If so
then I propose learning what a neuronomy can do by taking each component of
capitalism and rewording it to fit an AI engine. I hadn't wanted to do this as I
consider a neuronomy to be still decades away, but at your insistence I compiled
the following juxtaposition as an example. I used my knowledge of the Ingrid cycle
to create a new definition of a decision from a text book definition of an
investment. I did this in order to remove the concepts of funds, time, interest
and inflation. I'm sure that such a process could apply throughout and you would
end up with a complete philosophy that did not use money.

Definition of a Decision:

The continuing effort to grade something in order to identify structures that will
guide (1) in creating a consensus, (2) while allowing for emergencies, and (3)
also for the refinement of other projects.

Definition of an Investment:

The current commitment of funds for a period of time in order to derive a future
flow of funds that will compensate the investing unit (1) for the time the funds
are committed, (2) for the expected rate of inflation, and (3) also for the
uncertainty involved in the future flow of funds.

Since doing this little exercise (on_the_fly as it were) I noticed that the
investment definition was at an arms length to the subject whereas my ad hoc
decision definition was meddlesome. What would be the effect on society if there
were no arms length transactions. Anybody?

No, I have never quite understood why people react so strongly to
race, and having a black SO hasn't enlightened me.  I don't mind
being called a racist, as I feel it is next to impossible to engage
in vigorous discussions about economics, politics, or society

I am the one who hinted as racism in this case.

Nothing that onboard video surveillance combined and a swift & sure justice
system wouldn't fix. A more liberal policy with regard to keeping and
bearing arms would probably also help.

But it can reduce its negative effects. The good thing with technology is
that a well-designed system is much more reliable than humans, which
have never been designed for monotonous, robot-like tasks. People have
mood swings, personal agendas, they can get sick, feel frustrated with
their job (and take it out on the customers), can't work 24h a day, 7 days
a week (without quickly breaking down), they can go on strike, come late to
work etc. A machine simply does what it's programmed to do. Its lack
of flexibility (a flaw that can be largely compensated by smart design)
is only a relatively minor problem compared to its many advantages.

Smarter machine design, ubiquitous surveillance and a firm justice
system would ensure that only a handful of "supercriminals" could
get away with it. The rest would either start to behave or go to jail
....which would mean that the cops could soon focus all their attention
on the few remaining bad guys, and deal with them. This effect would
be further enhanced by the legalization of victimless crime, which
means there would be a lot less criminals to begin with. It may sound
"statist" or "cynical" to some, but at least it would actually work. And,
last but not least, it would honor the rational principles of maximal
personal freedom and responsibility for one's actions.

If you define society as one person's relationship to another, and
extend that to include an entire population, then an absence of arm's
length transactions might create the kind of virtual community
described by Howard Rhiengold in his book by that title. But to
displace current societal structure with an entirely virtual one seems
absolutely inappropriate if not totally impossible. No sensible reason
for completely abandoning all arm's length transactions occurs to me.
Consequently, the effect of eliminating arm's length transactions from
a portion of the social order would tend to have no other effect than
to increase emotional isolation of that society's members while
increasing transactions of the virtual kind. The only way to find out
how abandoning arm's length transactions would effect society would
require an actual experiment along those lines. As you probably have
read, MUDs (as just one example of a kind of social interaction at
other than arm's length) appear to have an addictive quality for
participants.

Cheers,

J. R.

Some.  The problem is that *everything* rests
on assumptions, and it is sometimes difficult to
defend scientific assumptions over religious ones.
The *only* thing that I know of which we can point 
to is science's track record so far, and that doesn't
seem to be very convincing to religionists.

There surely will be very many elements and constructs exposed by
eliminating arm's length transactions. I don't know whether to agree or
disagree with your principle effect. Maybe in the past we needed such
transactions because we didn't have an intellectual collaborator (Ingrid
on your arm) to do the real world semantic number crunching for us.
Anyway, upon reflection, the standard text book definition of an
investment does appear to have an exponential cancerous component built in
and I think "it" alone is what causes the "arms length" ghetto of today's
rich to immolate themselves to the biggest conflagration of excess the
world has ever seen.

Maybe we can rebuild a better world when the fire's out, eh?

Question:

Assuming a libertarian online marketplace, governed by the 
hippocratic oath (http://www.wh.com/cmem/codes/hippocraticoath.htm), 
what is the best structure for handling liability?

For example, someone orders a bag of marbles and some LSD.  They take 
the LSD, then put the marbles into their mouths, fall asleep, 
suffocate and die.  Is the website that provided the marbles and LSD 
responsible for the death?

Do members of the online free market release the vendors of all 
liability, before membership in the "sacred marketplace"?

Does the online marketplace provide CBT, automated diagnostics, and 
drug interaction warnings with each wholesale shipment of 
pharmaceuticals?  Do they maintain case records of customers?  Hmmm?

No, I have never quite understood why people react so strongly to
race, and having a black SO hasn't enlightened me.  I don't mind
being called a racist, as I feel it is next to impossible to engage
in vigorous discussions about economics, politics, or society

>From Vernor Vinge, foreword to "True Names And Other Dangers": 

      "I wanted interstellar empires (interplanetary ones at the 
      least).  I wanted supercomputers and artificial 
      intelligence and effective immortality.  All seemed 
      possible, yet there were inescapable consequences of 
      unbridled optimism..."

A good philosophy is one that contradicts you, rather than conforming 
to your wishes.  When this happens it means that your philosophy runs 
on its own rails, that it has logic and integrity, rather than being a 
means of rationalization.  Vinge, growing up in the 1950s, wanted 
interstellar empires, and I, growing up in the 80s and 90s with a copy 
of "Great Mambo Chicken and the Transhuman Condition", wanted to walk, 
uploaded, through my favorite worlds of SF and fantasy; to build my 
own planet, make my mind faster and free from pain, explore the galaxy 
with effective immortality, and so on.  My dreams had a shiny 
cyberspace finish, but they were not any more imaginative.  (Although 
one rather wonders what will happen to my little brother, growing up 
with a copy of "The Spike".)

Then I happened to take a copy of "True Names" out of the library, and 
my world was altered.  On paragraph two, page 47, when I read the 
sentence "When this happens, human history will have reached a kind of 
singularity - a place where extrapolation breaks down and new models 
must be applied - and the world will pass beyond our understanding."  
The first thing I thought was "Yes, he's right," and the next thing 
was, "I now know how I will be spending the rest of my life."  A few 
months later, I published "Staring Into The Singularity" and got large 
chunks of it wrong.

I knew about the Singularity, I had a new dream, and I'd even lost the 
old dreams, but this new dream was suspiciously malleable to my own 
desires.  I was sure that "the Powers will be ethical", and that this 
meant I would survive and be upgraded to a Power.  I did spend a lot 
of time telling people to worry about getting to the Singularity, 
instead of detailing the Utopia that would come afterwards.  And I was 
particularly scathing about certain failures of imagination.  I'd made 
progress, I'd increased the imaginativeness and power of my 
philosophy, but it was still obeying me instead of vice versa.

Now I am still sure that the Powers will be ethical, but I am no 
longer sure that this precludes taking us apart for spare atoms.  I no 
longer think that our continued survival has to threaten the Powers 
for us to be erased; I am now willing to accept that simple efficiency 
may require it.  I am willing to accept that life may be meaningless.  
I am willing to accept that the only reward for all my service will be 
a painful death, for myself, for those I love, and for the entire 
human race.  Only when one can accept all possibilities is one ready 
to choose between them.

The power of the Singularitarian philosophy is that it draws on 
concepts with more force than our own desires.  Over time, over years, 
it corrodes away our rationalizations.  And above all, it presents an 
emotionally and rationally acceptable course of action, even after all 
the darkest alternatives are accepted.  It really doesn't matter what 
the relative probabilities are.  Either life has meaning, or it 
doesn't; either human life has meaning, or it doesn't; either we'll be 
upgraded, or we'll die.  So we'll die?  All the other generations have 
died.  It's not some major tragedy because it happens to me instead of 
somebody else.  So humanity will die?  In a billion years, it is 
certain that humanity will die.  Is it so horrible if humanity dies 
giving birth to something greater, giving meaning to all our dead 
ancestors?  Sooner or later, some generation will face the choice 
between Singularity and extinction.  Why push it off, even if we 
could?  And besides, we might not die at all.

Because my best-guess dedication to the Singularity is fairly 
unaffected by the above probabilities varying between 0% and 90%, I 
can calmly and without worry evaluate arguments for and against.  I 
can accept that every possibility might be real.  The Singularity, 
through it all, is the only sane way to go.  In accepting every 
possibility, I can also accept the dictates of my own philosophy; I 
don't need to distort it to avoid "unacceptable" outcomes.

We must each lose our dreams in order to grow, but not in despair.  We 
must abandon the small dreams of childhood, but without abandoning the 
ability to dream.  For there are two ways in which a dream may be 
broken; by the death of hope, or by a greater dream.  To acknowledge 
that we do not command the future, is not to say that we do not make 
it; and when we tear our eyes away from our yearnings, we may look 
upward to the sun, forward to tomorrow. 

Forward to the day when humanity awakens from its dream, to the 
ultimate shattering of Maya.  To the day when the greatest hacker of 
them all compiles the very last line of code, and looks out at an 
early morning sky, knowing that he looks on the Final Dawn.  To the 
day when it is said, in the tradition of Oppenheimer who looked upon 
another sun:  "I am become Singularity, Breaker of Dreams."

Caveat Vendor (seller beware)

Special concern for accountability is appropriate when the user of a
service is at a
significant disadvantage in relation to the provider, as may be the case
with complex
'uploading' services. In such cases the rule tends, properly, to be
caveat vendor
(seller beware). The vendor is liable for harm or fraud which the
disadvantaged
consumer was not in a position to understand or avert. Thus 'uploading'
products
and services should be subject to extensive environmental, humanitarian,
and
ethical review by which the vendor establishes that he has shown due
regard for
the consumer's interest and is not negligent.

No, I have never quite understood why people react so strongly to
race, and having a black SO hasn't enlightened me.  I don't mind
being called a racist, as I feel it is next to impossible to engage
in vigorous discussions about economics, politics, or society
without earning that rebuke from someone.  I am rather ashamed that
I am the one who hinted as racism in this case.

I am eager to correct any and all of my errors.  Unfortunately
grace is not one of my strong points. I will take this episode as
another lesson in how to avoid being ungracious.

So, I apologize again to Damien and the list for giving anyone an
erroneous impression that I think Damien is a racist.  He clearly
is not a racist and I have never thought him to be one.

With which I agree.  By and large, extropiansim per se is a personal
philosophy that says less about "society" than it does about "the individual".
This is not to say that extropians find society at large or social problem
irrelevant, but simply that THIS particular mode of thought and evaluation may
not offer much, if any answer for questions that are not about the individual.
That said, I think Hal's also made a very good point that extropian values are
the kinds of values that unemployed INDIVIDUALS would find useful.

A problem with ending the discussion there is that it doesn't say much about
how to transmit extropian values to people who don't know about them (even if
they may not be called "extropianism") and who are indisposed, as a matter of
their individual biographies, to accept them even if they DO learn of them.

It doesn't hurt to think about this problem in extropian terms.  So, over the
first cup of coffee, here's a take at "extropian" solutions to structural
unemployment:

Earlier in the discussion, Robin Hanson suggested a taxonomy of unemployment
(and suggested that we talk about only one sub-issue, a wise suggestion I
unwisely ignore):

> 1) Search - one is between jobs, and doesn't want to grab the first job 
>     that comes along.  Similarly, companies don't want to hire the first
>     candidate that comes along.  

This is probably the easiest aspect of the issue to address with the
"extropian toolkit".  Even the mainstream business press now accepted the
reality of a true "information revolution" and we're likely to see more and
more improvements in quality as well as quantity.  The abstract problem of
matching people to jobs is one that will become increasingly less difficult as
time passes.  I see advertisements for web-based job searching tools all the
time.  The information cost of finding a job should drop to near zero in the
mid-term future (20 years) as access to near-perfect job information is
available to even the poorest in the first world.  Problem solved :-)

>  2) Minimum wages - supply & demand may not meet with imposed wage bounds.
>     The price employers would be willing to pay may be below the bound.

This is one where ideological issues and practical politics impede progress,
or at least experimentation.  Both of the mainstream political parties in the
U.S. accept a minimum wage without question, and I have no doubt whatsoever
that the same is true throughout the first world.  

Clever people who want to work or to create jobs below the minimum wage get
around the limits in some cases.  Some entry-level job-types escape the effect
of minimum wage constraints through de-facto independent contracting.  I'm
thinking of many kinds of domestic personal service, such as one's yard
workers or swimming pool workers.  But the kinds of entry-level work that
could lead to the improvement of the working skills of unemployed people in a
first world economy are the very ones most likely to be effected by minimum
wage constraints.

Although it has little chance of being adopted without other fundamental
structural changes, an extropian solution to this problem would be to create
experimental "free enterprise zones" where minimum wage constraints were
significantly relaxed or did not apply at all.

If one accepts that basic life-sustaining products and services will become
cheaper with advanced automation and manufacturing techniques, the pressure to
maintain minimum wages should abate.  If many of us who expect such decreases
are right, one should look for a lowering of a fairly-calculated "poverty
line" sometime in the mid-term future; say, sometime just beyond 20 years from
now.  If this happens, then the time would then be right to move for
experimentation with a lowering of the minimum wage, with concomitant positive
effects on unemployment.

As I've pointed out before, credit co-ops seem to me to be a very extropian
solution to this problem.  Organizations like Grameen Bank offer at least one
avenue of progress on capital accumulation for people at the lowest ends of
the spectrum.  Over-regulation of the financial industry, especially
regulation created by a state structure too much under the thrall of
established, large financial institutions, is a major barrier to use of this
tool.  Ironically, second- and third world countries, with less "efficient"
financial regulatory mechanisms, have had better luck with credit co-ops like
Grameen.

Robin's reference to bankruptcy laws and indentured service raises a much more
complex set of issues.  I can't help but think that limitations on creditor
retaliation for default have at least some positive effects on entrepreneurial
motivation.  Whether those positive effects are offset by the negative effect
of limitations on credit is a FACTUAL question, but one which would be
exceedingly difficult to subject to empirical analysis.  (I don't doubt that
economic MODELS can be created to support either conclusion :-)

>  4) Time runs out - if your industry/career gets smaller, and you're near 
>     retirement, it may not be worth retraining you.

Another area that can be ameliorated with application of extropian ideas and
values.  First, a lowering of information barriers generally should make
retraining easier and less costly.  Second, the kinds of work that older
people can do should be increasing as value shifts away from manual labor and
toward mental labor.  Third, with increasing life spans, "retirement age" will
steadily rise, while at the same time the social custom of sabbaticals should
further erode a unitary image of a single "life/career".

>  5) Bad luck - if your industry/career gets less in demand, you may have to

Insurance is the solution.  How it's implemented is of course another whole
set of questions.  Monolithic state-supported unemployment insurance tends to
be inflexible and a poor tool for creating the kind of loss-history/premium
feedback that is essential for effective operation of insurance mechanisms.
An extropian approach would be to encourage wherever possible the creation and
implementation of a diverse marketplace of private unemployment insurance.

This is at least a two-fold problem.  As I point out above, credit co-ops are
one tool that poor people can use to accumulate capital.  Second, as
information-work becomes more important, locality becomes less important.
Thus we see developments like the information workers in the second and third
world (I'm thinking of India and Russia, and just encountered the same
phenomenon in Mexico) who telecommute to work in the first world.  This is
high-end work, of course, but is at least one facet of a solution to this
aspect of the problem.

This isn't completely true. We *can* command the future if we finish
the dash for SI in first place. If you lose yourself in defeatism you're
already as good as dead. The facts are simple: 

1) at this time, only a handful of people really grasp the enormity 
of the coming changes, and (almost certainly) most of them are 
transhumanists (unfortunately, even in this select group many
can't/won't understand the consequences of a Singularity, but
that aside).

2) This gives us a *huge* edge, further increased by the high 
concentration of scientific/technological talent in the >H community.
 
3) If we start preparing now, by keeping a close eye on the
the development of technologies that could play a major part
in the Singularity (nanotech, AI, implants, intelligence
augmentation, human-machine interfaces in general etc.) 
and by aquiring wealth (by any effective means) to set up a 
SI research facility, then we have a real chance of success. 

Note: the goal should (obviously) be creating SI by "uplifting" 
(gradually uploading and augmenting) humans, *not* from AIs.

If you want to know how The Ingrid Thought Processor would allocate

I wish I had a point that I wanted to make so strongly.  I sent

it was just me.  I guess not.  The only headers that change with

Yeah. I'm sure the little old lady will feel really happy as she lies dying
on the floor after the thugs beat her up, knowing that -- Thank God! -- a
surveillance camera recorded the whole thing and the thugs might, possibly,
be caught. If the operator wasn't using the zoom lens to peep at the other 
women in the carriage; which is apparently the single largest use of the
British police surveillance cameras, according to a recent report.

This is the whole problem with surveillance; it's purely an attempt to deter
criminals with the threat of potential capture, and most of them aren't 
going to stop because of it. I recently saw a surveillance video of a few
kids on a British housing estate who smashed up a car with rocks then
set it on fire, in full view of the camera. Maybe the kids were caught --
though the resolution was so low I doubt I could identify them from it --
but I'm sure that won't make the car's owner any happier.

(Formally, I would distinguish between the state of the civilization
and the "value" it is optimizing)

I think there is a large amount of contingency here. If we assume that
all civilizations seek to become better at doing stuff, until they
reach the limits set by physics, then their structure would still be
rather contingent.

Imagine (somewhat arbitrarily) that the ultimate limits were
medieval-level technology. What kinds of societies and cultures could
exist in such a strongly constrained system? Looking back at history,
we see that we could have very many styles (ranging from icelandic
anarchy, european feudalism over the arabs and indians to the chinese
empire), and that a lot of possibilities that could have happened were
unexplored (like a more technically advanced Atztec empire, for
example).

The space of possible societies and cultures appears to be so large
that there isn't time to search through it for an optimum of some
kind, very much like the situation is in evolution of species
today. Most likely societies will end up in local maxima, and if there
are several their mutual competition might lead to an overall
co-evolutionary random walk through the space of possibilities without
end.

We can determine some of the limits of doing stuff, which gives us
some constraints on their possible actions. But what they actually do,
that is hard to tell. Unless it is possible to develop some kind of
"psychohistory" that describes the evolution of cultural goals -
perhaps possible, but tricky.

Mihály Csíkszentmihályi suggested the amount of flow experienced - how
many of the citizens/subsystems achieve their goals in a constructive
(for them) way?

Not necessarily. It might remain static, or in some kind of local
attractor. It might even turn out that once one factor was optimized,
new factors become important to fix - it would wander in a subspace of
the total space of possibilities.

I can think of one thing: the end of evolution, or the start of a new
form of evolution.

Hmm, isn't that truly extropian music in the sense that it helps you
grow and develop? (the floundering part might need some help, through
- I always think the artist should give the audience a sporting chance
:-).

It is also interesting from an information theoretical point of
view. Music you can predict doesn't give you any new information - it
is the unexpected stuff that is information-rich. Of course, not all
information is equal.

I think you could do all sorts of exciting things if the food was
active - it interacted with your tastebuds not just passively but
actively changing the taste over time. Imagine ripples of taste
crescendoing over your tounge in synch with the dinner music.

Note that with nanotech food design becomes a software industry, and
everybody can have the public domain grilled veal chop madeira with
vintage wine somebody scanned - but you have to pay for the exclusive
version (after all, the pd version is always the same) or the handmade

The extropian principles doesn't say that (at least not 2.6, I seem to
recall that the 3.0 draft is a bit stronger), but I have also noted
that many get a bit carried away about SO. It is good and useful, but
not always applicable.

"Top-down" and "Bottom-up" solutions both have their place, the trick

the big question underlying (say) the capitalism debate, and could

if treated as a problem in understanding the system (not that I think
it is a simple problem). In some cases it is clear that one works
well, sometimes combinations might be useful (local top-down
solutions, or perhaps a planned system containing reserve pockets of
diversity?). This is really an area that can be developed - I wonder
what has been done in it?

:-) Your'e right, all the best games are in some sense
self-organizing. Most likely they are great because they are complex,
the SO creates surprises which doesn't occur in non-organizing games.

Because intelligence is able to "jump ahead", finding stuff that the

solution to an equation by brute force, but I can find an elegant
proof (sometimes). A market consisting of simple, stupid actors is
likely less useful as a market of smart actors.

I think that securitizing fractions of future wage income offers a great potential
for flexible wage insurance.  If I can sell some of my future wages in trade
for some of yours, or in trade for corporate stock, I'm less at risk from 
variations in my future wages.  Of course you would probably want to guarentee
that you held some minimal fraction of those assets, so buyers could be assured
you'd have incentives to work.

It should be noted that other decay processes like proton decay are
much faster, if they exist. The process Dyson studies is essentilly
random, quantum fluctuations making the drifting pieces of matter
implode into black holes which then evaporate. This means the numbers
are half-lives rather than exact ages; in the dust scenario matter
will vanish with a half life of 10^10^26 years.

However, it all depends on how small black holes can be. If they must
be fairly large, then small pieces of matter are safe. My
understanding of Hawking evaporation and small black holes is
rudimentary, but it seems to point to alternative (ii) in the paper.

Another paper looking at the situation but reaching a different
conclusion (through proton decay) is

Here is a fun question: what is the slowest rate of memory growth that
doesn't get into an infinite loop? It seems to be logarithmic if we
measure time by computational steps:

If the system has N(t) bits of memory at timestep t, it can be in
2^N(t) different states. Suppose it traverses all of them without
increasing N, then it would have to recur to a previous state and
would get trapped in an infinite loop. So at time t+2^N(t) the system
has to increase N by at least one bit. Hence N(t) will grow as log(t).

So the system radius must grow faster than (log(t))^1/3, and slower
(due to lightspeed) than t.

Yes, for example he doesn't take reversible computing (or
near-reversible computing) into account, and his derivation of the
entropy needs of life seems a bit aged; this can likely be improved
now.

I have a paper on that, which by now is eons old. I'll try to finish it.

I had a posthuman "wet dream" about AI sex. It was based on the
assumption that pleasure for the AIs equalled solved problems/gained
information, so AI sex involves a complex folding together of
subprocesses of two or more AI systems so that they support each other
and give each other an efficiency boost. There were constant
references to Bach fugues.  The visuals were interesting, luminious
clouds of code linked by complex webs of function calls and message
passing floating over a plain of hardware.

OK, my dreams are unusual.

David Friedman is discussing questions like these in a book that he's
writing, called _Why Is Law?_.  Interesting stuff.  He's webbing the
chapters as he's writing them; you might want to take a look at:

http://www.best.com/~ddfr/

Under the "Why Is Law?" link.

In this particular case, placing all of the liability on the buyer gives
the buyer a great incentive not to do something stupid (like taking LSD and
holding marbles in one's mouth), but perhaps not infinitely great.  If the
buyer's desire to do such a silly thing outweighed the value the buyer
placed on his/her own life, then the buyer *should* have taken LSD and
marbles together.  Since we imagine that the buyer is in the best (if not
the perfect) position to evaluate the value of his/her own life, it would
be most efficient to place all liability on the buyer, which should
maximize economic value in this case.

In contrast, by placing liability on the seller, the *seller* must
determine whether or not it would be worthwhile to sell the LSD/marbles.
Since the seller's only criterion is profits, the seller must try to guess
how valuable the court will guess the buyer's life is, and use this guess
to renegotiate his/her prices.  The very act of introducing a court in this
case results in inefficiency; the fallibility of the court's evaluation of
the buyer's life results in situations when the seller will set his price
inefficiently high or inefficiently low.

This is not an argument for universal "caveat emptor," but reflects the
advantages of caveat emptor in this case.

Welcome everyone to the promised singularity discussion,
which began on the 6th, and will end on the 19th.  (We have
had two posts so far, by Eliezer S. Yudkowsky and den Otter.)

I have two roles here, one as editor/fascilitator and another as 
participant.  I'll try to make clear which hat I'm wearing in 
each post.  In this post, I'm wearing an editorial hat.  

Our discussion so far, the comments and Vinge's replies, are 
thoughtful and informative.  But they also impress on me how broad 
this singularity topic remains.  In my experience, singularity 
conversations typically haven't gone into enough depth on any one
topic to really make much intellectual progress.  So my hope in 
creating this discussion was to try to create a critical mass of 
focus and attention.  It's not clear that this will happen, but 
I'm still hopeful.  

With this hope in mind, let me encourage participants to focus
on a few central issues, rather than following all interesting
associations evoked by the "singularity" concept.  And let us 
try to make some real contact, rather than posturing at a distance.
Let us try to make clear what are the claims we are debating, 
before we get too far into debating them.  And let us try to offer
evidence and analysis for or against various positions, rather than 
just declaring our beliefs.  

Of course I may have misjudged the whole situation.  What do the rest 
of you think of the state of the debate on singularity?
What do you think is most needed to clarify these issues?

I missed the original post here, but it's a false dichotomy to place human
intelligence on one end of the stick and spontaneous order on the other.
Ultimately, human intelligence runs on spontaneous order; no one runs their
brain from the top-down.

You impose a block on your thinking if you view it this way...  Ultimately
all of our solutions to problems will involve spontaneous order if we solve
them with our brains.

Perhaps a better question might be to ask when it is best to find all of
the information and find the optimal solution, compared to when it is best
to remain "rationally ignorant," as economists often put it.  We do not
have enough information to find the optimal solution to every problem which
presents itself.  In some cases, we can try and guess how likely it is that
one solution or another will be correct, but even that isn't possible in a
wide variety of cases.

In these situations, a strategy which relies on the adaptive behavior of
systems will tend to work better.  To go back to the economic analogy, if
we could know everything everyone knows at no cost, we could easily make
centrally-planned economies work.  However, the cost of acquiring and using
this information is so great that this strategy is unfeasible.  Since we
must remain in rational ignorance, the best strategy is to employ a system
which does not require anyone to know everything about the whole system:
capitalism is one such solution.

In comparison, we *can* know all or most of the relevant variables for some
problems, and in those cases we can find the optimal solution from known
principles rather than depend on something like a genetic algorithm which
may get stuck in a saddle-point.

In systems with lots of different parts with high error tolerance, that have
to exchange information at many different levels to operate well . . .  Like
an economy, but unlike, say the parts of a car.

Has a certain scientist of our acquaintance bothered to issue any sort of
explanation as to how, precisely, he intends to bring a cloned baby of
himself to full term in his post-menopausal wife?  Does he plan to pump her
full of hormones, or perhaps remove her womb entirely and place it in
stasis?  What happened to the hordes of young fertile volunteers he claimed
were beating down his door to be the first to bear a cloned child?  Has he
provided anything in way of proof that a post-menopausal female can even
sustain a pregnancy without miscarriage or serious harm to herself?

Really, I just cannot see how this man's utter selfishness and hubris does
anything to promote a rational approach to the development of cloning. If
anything, we can look forward to this being dredged up in various lawmaking
fora around the globe as a primary reason for imposing strict controls on
the technology, or banning it altogether.

I saw a trailer the other night for Pleasantville, opening October 16.

You can't always believe in a preview, but what I saw looked marvelously
inspiring, with overtones of The Truman Show.

A brother and sister get zapped into a 1950's Leave-It-To-Beaver TV show
called Pleasantville.  This is an old premise but looks to be handled
in a new way.  Through their interactions with the townspeople, modern
elements gradually begin to intrude and threaten the safe, conventional
life of Pleasantville.

Visually, this is handled by having Pleasantville be in black and white.
The introduction of elements from the real world appears as the addition
of color.  The trailer has beautiful scenes where characters who have
"awakened" are shown in color as they live in their monochrome world.
It's a stunning contrast and should be even more effective in the theater
after seeing nothing by b&w through most of the movie.  Apparently the
film has set a record for most visual effects.

The music in the trailer is the stirring theme from the Disney movie
Homeward Bound (about the dogs and cat who travel across the Sierra
Nevada to rejoin their family).  Probably this won't be carried over
into the movie, but it's too bad because it really went well with the
theme of overcoming conformity.

Hopefully the movie will live up to its advance buzz.  Watch for it -

For my own benefit, and in the hope of stimulating some discussion, I
hope to work through the essays Robin has put online, posting my own
comments on each essay.  To begin, I'll start off with Gregory
Benford's comments.  I doubt I'll proceed alphabetically through the
comments, but the start of the alphabet is a good starting point.

(Some editorial assistance would be useful here: Robin, should we feel
free to quote from the online essays?  I've quoted this one in
full...)

A few observations on what I think Mr. Benford is saying, and my
responses, if any.

1. The comment presupposes that a "singularity" will occur.

2. It is not clear what the "singularity" is supposed to entail, at the
level of detail.  What are the supposed enabling technologies for
Mr. Benford's singularity? What is the decisive point?

3. This comment does indicate an interesting "sharp" delineation between
people who have "passed through" the Singularity, and people who haven't.
The Singularity is sometimes portrayed as something that will occur very
quickly; the "alternate" point of view is that it will take longer.
This comment suggests a different way of thinking about the
time-scales: there is a timescale for the individual, and a timescale
for larger groups.  These two timescales need not coincide, or even be 
closely related.  They also need to be separately argued.

4. Mr. Benford's main point seems to be that "...most of humanity
won't take part, for every singularity can be made non-singular by a
simple resistive term...and there are always such", and then defines
"By "resistive term" I mean that nothing works perfectly and the
separation of a fraction will be interrupted by glitches, failures of
power/support."

The logic of the statement can be attacked in various ways.  What if
the coming of the Singularity is brought about by a superintelligence
that is able to circumvent all the "resistive terms"?  Even if such
interruptions do occur, they may only be temporary; what is to stop
the rest of humanity from following after the interruption has been removed?

5. I'm not sure what the last sentence means (?) 


To sum up: The "separation of timescales" is a good point that I
hadn't fully appreciated before.  I find the main point of Mr
Benford's comment rather questionable.  It needs more supporting
evidence to be tenable.

[In this post, I wear my participant hat. RH]

Vinge has mostly satisfied me that he does not literally mean that 
post-singularity things are "unknowable," though he for some reason
still likes to use that word.  It is hard to object much to his
refined descriptor, "qualitatively less understandable," and I
grant the possibility of "styles of cognition possible to higher 
technologies that are radically different from ours."   Vinge even 
acknowledges that future self-aware modules may not be much larger 
than we are.  

Given this, let me focus on what I think is now the central issue:
timing.  

I think that most thoughtful people will acknowledge that it is hard
to place limits on what our descendants will accomplish if substantial
numbers of them survive for another billion years, and continue to 
attempt to improve their technology over this time.  This implies both 
that super-human artificial intelligences (AIs) may well eventually 
appear, and that we now may find it very difficult to envision what 
they and their world will evolve into. 

In contrast, Vinge's "singularity" concept seems to me to claim much 
more, so much more that it becomes a radical claim few people endorse.  
It claims that these super-human AIs will appear within the next few 
decades, and then within a few years transform themselves and their 
world into something very difficult for us to imagine.  The essential 
difference between this view and the widely acceptable view I describe 
above is one of timing.  What most people acknowledge to be possible 
over a billion years, Vinge suggests is likely to transpire within just
a few years.  

Now Vinge does acknowledge the possibility of a slower transition, and
this does serve to signal that Vinge is a reasonable person.  But it
does not substitute for an analysis in favor of his radical claim.  

Max More and I both took issue with Vinge's timing claim, but Vinge
just refers Max More to his reply to Nick Bostrom, which is:

  To me, what Nick calls "Verticality" is just a plausible side effect of
  the creation of superintelligence. This is mostly by analogy with past
  progress:
   o Before humankind, the kingdom of life evolved by natural
     selection -- a kind of "simulation" which proceeded as one with
     the real world. 
   o Humans have the ability to run simulations internally (far more
     so than other animals). Adaptation is several orders of magnitude
     faster than in the previous phase.
   o We humans now are developing devices which can run simulations
     faster than our internal, biological "hardware" can do. I think
     it's plausible that the accompanying speedup will have the
     appearance of "Verticality" over the human phase.

Vinge seems to be just rephrasing this paragraph from his original paper:  

  ... When greater-than-human
  intelligence drives progress, that progress will be much more rapid.
  In fact, there seems no reason why progress itself would not involve
  the creation of still more intelligent entities -- on a still-shorter
  time scale. The best analogy that I see is with the evolutionary past:
  Animals can adapt to problems and make inventions, but often no faster
  than natural selection can do its work -- the world acts as its own
  simulator in the case of natural selection. We humans have the ability
  to internalize the world and conduct "what if's" in our heads; we can
  solve many problems thousands of times faster than natural selection.
  Now, by creating the means to execute those simulations at much higher
  speeds, we are entering a regime as radically different from our human
  past as we humans are from the lower animals.

Before this discussion can proceed further, I think we need to get clear
on what exactly Vinge is claiming in these two passages.  I'd be most 
interested in how others translate these, but my reading is:

 "Progress" rates increase with the speed of the processors involved.

Now it's not clear what "progress" metrics are valid here, but if 
economists' usual measures are valid, such as growth rate in world 
product, there are two immediate problems with this theory:

1) Progress rates increased greatly over the last hundred thousand 
   years until a century ago without any change in the cycle speed of 
   the processors involved.
2) Computer processor speeds have increased greatly over the last 
   century without much increase in rates of progress.  

(Furthermore, even if we accept this paraphrased claim, it is not 
clear that we must accept Vinge's timing claims.  For this, I think 
we'd need do say more about just how rapidly progress increases with 
processor speed.)

Hello:

On a whim, I contacted the person Mr Legg offered as a reference for the
allegation that Soviet Communism was in actuality a set of 7 private
trusts;  here is the pertinent part of the reply I received:

From: markland@rockisland.com (Lee Markland) Date: Sun, Sep 6, 1998,
5:13am  To: JGanong@webtv.net Subject: Re: Russian Communism = Swedish 7
Corp. Slavers? 
This is all I have on hand. 
Peter Drucker visited the Soviet Union and came back and wrote an
article for Fortnightly Magazine in 1922. In it he said that the Soviet
Union was in reality seven trusts, organized along economic lines
(lumber, mining, etc). I don't have all of my original footnotes to my
researches and I scanned in my manuscript, sans two pages one of which
alas is the actual publication date of the Fortnightly Article, but it
is 1922.

                  ************************

There was more, but it did not provide anything further on the point in
question.

Sorry to take up the bandwidth, but the allegation was *so* outlandish
to many of us that I thought even such a skimpy reference might be of
some interest.

Very interesting and visual.  I was thinking this morning about posthuman
sexuality in similar terms.  It would seem logical to rewire the brain's
reward system so that it got pleasure directly from solving problems.
The sexual drive would be sublimated into problem solving.  Actually there
are people who seem to be able to do this kind of rechannelling to some
extent, and I believe they do get direct mental pleasure from their
activities, but probably not of the intensity we associate with sexuality.

I'm not sure how it would map to the sexual pattern of excitement/
plateau/orgasmic release.  Problem solving sometimes does have this
pattern, working towards a solution, feeling that you are "almost there",
and then the "aha" as you realize that it all works.  However this is
not universal and sometimes the solution appears without warning, while
other times the realization that a solution really works requires a long
period of verification and testing.

Subject: Singularity: Are posthumans understandable?
Sender: owner-extropians@extropy.com
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

[This is a repost of an article I sent to the list July 21.]

It's an attractive analogy that a posthuman will be to a human as a
human is to an insect.  This suggests that any attempt to analyze or
understand the behavior of post-singularity intelligence is as
hopeless as it would be for an insect to understand human society. 
Since insects clearly have essentially no understanding of humans, it
would follow by analogy that we can have no understanding of
posthumans.

On reflection, though, it seems that it may be an oversimplification
to say that insects have no understanding of humans.  The issue is
complicated by the fact that insects probably have no "understanding"
at all, as we use the term.  They may not even be conscious, and may
be better thought of as nature's robots, of a similar level of
complexity as our own industrial machines.  Since insects do not have
understanding, the analogy to humans does not work very well.  If we
want to say that our facility for understanding will not carry over
into the posthuman era, we need to be able to say that insect's
facility for <something> would not work when applied to humans.

What we need to do is to translate the notion of "understanding" into
something that insects can do.  That makes the analogy more precise
and improves the quality of the conclusions it suggests.

It seems to me that while insects do not have "understanding" as we
do, they do nevertheless have a relatively detailed model of the world
which they interact with.  Even if they are robots, programmed by
evolution and driven by unthinking instinct, still their programming
embodies a model of the world.  A butterfly makes its way to flowers,
avoides predators, knows when it is hungry or needs to rest.  These
decisions may be made unconsciously like a robot, but they do
represent a true model of itself and of the world.

What we should ask, then, is whether insect's model of the world can
be successfully used to predict the behavior of humans, in the terms
captured by the model itself.  Humans are part of the world that
insects must deal with.  Are they able to successfully model human
behavior at the level they are able to model other aspects of the
world, so that they can thrive alongside humanity?

Obviously insects do not predict many aspects of human behavior.
Still, in terms of the level of detail that they attempt to capture,
I'd say they are reasonably effective.  Butterflies avoid large
animals, including humans.  Some percentage of human-butterfly
interactions would involve attempts by the humans to capture the
butterflies, and so the butterflies' avoidance instinct represents a
success of their model.  Similarly for many other insects for whom the
extent of their model of humans is as "possible threat, to be
avoided".

Other insects have historically thrived in close association with
humans, such as lice, fleas, ants, roaches, etc.  Again, without
attempting to predict the full richness of human behavior, their
models are successful in expressing those aspects which they care
about, so that they have been able to survive, often to the detriment
of the human race.

If we look at the analogy in this way, it suggests that we may expect
to be able to understand some aspects of posthuman behavior, without
coming anywhere close to truly understanding and appreciating the full
power of their thoughts.  Their mental life may be far beyond anything
we can imagine, but we could still expect to draw some simple
conclusions about how they will behave, things which are at the level
which we can understand.  Perhaps Robin's reasoning based on
fundamental principles of selection and evolution would fall into this
category.

We may be as ants to the post singularity intelligences, but even so,
we may be able to successfully predict some aspects of their behavior,
just as ants are able to do with humans.

I would add to this that the simulations are not only faster, but
potentially larger, more complex, more detailed, and more realistic than
the level of modelling which can be done by a human mind.  Consider Deep
Blue, capable of looking at billions of chess positions with perfect
accuracy.

I find that this phrasing invites the assumption of a simple relationship
between the two, which is probably not what Vinge has in mind.
What I take him to be saying is that this new resource will be able to
greatly increase the rate of progress by facilitating simulations at an
unprecedented level.  However there is presumably a threshold effect,
where primitive simulation tools do not play a significant role.

No doubt there are many factors influencing the rate of progress.
It is still possible that adding powerful computers to the mix will make
a difference.

It could be that the amount of computer power available is still too
small to make a significant contribution.

One metric sometimes used is total brainpower vs total computer power.
If we assume that the latter continues to grow as the product of Moore's
law and economic growth rates then the total human+computer power can
be expected to be dominated by computers in a few decades.  If computers
can be given problem-solving heuristics comparable in power to those used
by humans, and if their total computational power becomes thousands,
then millions, then billions of times greater than that of humanity,
then it is plausible that problem-solving abilities will increase by a
similar factor.

It may be that economic growth rates won't be the most appropriate
metric for progress.  The large installed base of existing technologies
and natural human conservatism may put us into a new kind of economy.
New ideas will be coming out of the labs far faster than they can
be incorporated into society as a whole.  We might see a form of
"social shear" where some people are pushing forward as fast as they
can while others are hanging back, and still others are trying to hold
society together.  (Unfortunately shear strain often resolves itself
catastrophically.)

I cant remember who proposed the theory that music is a balance of boredom and
surprise.  If the notes are too regular, the music is boring.  If there is too
much surprise, it is noise and cacaphony.  Of coures the appropriate balance
between surprise and boredom in music are cultural and individual.   Bach or

A difference yes.  But without a relatively direct relationship between
growth rates and processor speeds, its not at all obvious that the difference
is enough to induce the very rapid growth scenario Vinge describes.

This may be a plausible way to think about growth, though I'm not sure
it is what Vinge has in mind.  Even granting that the important parameter
is the total computer power, and assuming it will continue to grow at
present rates even when it dominates the economy, you get maybe a doubling
time of every two years, which I'm not sure is enough to be Vinge's
fast growth scenario.

But this is the way economic growth has been for a long time.  There
have always been lots more ideas than we can implement, and the rate
at which changes can be absorbed has long been a limiting factor.

Extracts from http://pobox.com/~sentience/sing_analysis.html#transition

Quoting Max More:  (http://hanson.berkeley.edu/vc.html#more)

      "Curiously, the first assumption of an immediate jump from
      human-level AI to superhuman intelligence seems not to be a
      major hurdle for most people to whom Vinge has presented this
      idea. Far more people doubt that human level AI can be
      achieved. My own response reverses this: I have no doubt that
      human level AI (or computer networked intelligence) will be
      achieved at some point. But to move from this immediately to
      drastically superintelligent thinkers seems to me doubtful."

This was the best objection raised, since it is a question of human-level
AI and cognitive science, and therefore answerable.  While I disagree
with More's thesis on programmatic grounds, there are also technical
arguments in favor.  In fact, it was my attempt to answer this question
that gave birth to "Coding A Transhuman AI".  (I tried to write down the
properties of a seed AI that affected the answer, and at around 3:00 AM
realized that it should probably be a separate page...)
  [Skip to end]
To summarize:  First, if a seed AI reaches human equivalence, it has
programming ability considerably beyond what's required to enhance
human-level abilities.  Second, there are sharp differences between seed
AI power and human power, seed AI efficiency and neural-programmer
efficiency, and different efficiency/power/intelligence curves for the
species.  My estimated result is a bottleneck followed by a sharp snap
upwards, rather than a steady increase; and that the "snap" will occur
short of humanity and pass it rapidly before halting; and that when the
snap halts, it will be at an intelligence level sufficient for rapid
infrastructure. 
  [Skip back]
The AI is likely to bottleneck at the architectural stage - in fact,
architecture is probably the Transcend Point; once the AI breaks through,
it will go all the way.  [...]
Once the seed AI understands its own architecture, it can design new
abilities for itself, dramatically optimize old abilities, spread its
consciousness into the Internet, etc.  I therefore expect this to be the
major bottleneck on the road to AI.  Understanding program architectures
is the main requirement for rewriting your own program.  (Assuming you
have a compiler...)  I suppose that the AI could still bottleneck again,
short of human intelligence - having optimized itself but still lacking
the raw computing power for human intelligence.

But if the AI gets up to human equivalence, as Max More readily grants,
it will possess both human consciousness and The AI Advantage. 
Human-equivalent intelligence, in the sense of programming all human
abilities into an AI, isn't human equivalent at all.  It is considerably
on the other side of transhuman.  [...]
Human high-level consciousness and AI rapid algorithmic performance
combine synergetically.
  [...]
While the self-enhancing trajectory of a seed AI is complex, there are
surface properties that can be quantitatively related:  Intelligence,
efficiency, and power.  The interaction between these three properties
determines the trajectory, and that trajectory can bottleneck - quite
possibly exactly at human intelligence levels.
  [...]
Power and efficiency determine intelligence; efficiency could even be
defined as a function showing the levels of intelligence achievable at
each level of power, or the level of power necessary to achieve a given
level of intelligence.  Efficiency in turn is related in a non-obvious
but monotonically increasing way to intelligence - more intelligence
makes it possible for the AI to better optimize its own code. 
  [...]
Two interesting points immediately arise.  First, the Transcend Point
almost certainly requires a basic minimum of power.  In fact, the amount
of raw power may exert as much influence on the trajectory as all the
complexities of architecture.  While a full-fledged Power might be able
to write a Singularity-capable program that ran on a Mac Plus, it is
improbable that any human or seed AI could do so.  The same may apply to
other levels of power, and nobody knows how.  Tweaking the level of power
might enable a bottleneck to be imposed almost anywhere, except for a few
sharp slopes of non-creative self-optimization.  The right level of
limited power might even create an actual transhuman bottleneck, at least
until technology advanced... although the transhuman might be very slow
(Mailman), or a huge increase in power might be required for any further
advancement.  Or there might be sharp and absolute limits to
intelligence.  (I must say that the last two possibilities strike me as
unlikely; while I have no way of peering into the transhuman
trajectories, I still see no arguments in support of either.) 

We now come to Max More's point.  It so happens that all humans operate,
by and large, at pretty much the same level of intelligence.  While our
level could be coincidental, it could also represent the location of a
universal bottleneck.  If one is to guess where AIs will come to a sudden
halt, one could do worse than to guess "the same place as all the other
sentients".
  [...]
In short, the brain doesn't self-enhance, only self-optimize a prehuman
subsystem.  You can't draw conclusions from one system to the other.  The
genes give rise to an algorithm that optimizes itself and then programs
the brain according to genetically determined architectures - this
multi-stage series not only isn't self-enhancement, it isn't even
circular.
  [...]
The point is - how much raw power does it take to create a seed AI? 
(This is the converse of the usual skepticism, where we allow that
Moore's Law gives us all the power we want and question whether anyone
knows what to do with it.)  It could take a hundred times the power of
the human brain, just to create a crude and almost unconscious version! 
We don't know how the neural-level programmer works, and we don't know
the genetically programmed architecture, so our crude and awkward
imitation might consume 10% of the entire worldwide Internet twenty years
from now, plus a penalty for badly distributed programming, and still run
at glacial speeds.  The flip side of that inefficiency is that once such
a being reaches the Transcend Point, it will "go all the way" easily
enough - it has a hundred times human power at its disposal.  Once it
reaches neural-programmer efficiencies, its old intelligence only
occupies 1% of the power available to it - and by the time the newly
available power has been used up, it has probably reached a new level of
efficiency and freed up more power, and also gained the ability to create
nanotechnological rapid infrastructure. 

If, on the other hand, human programmers are more efficient than the
neural-level optimizer, then the seed AI might have human-equivalent
ability on a tenth of the power - perhaps running on the 'Net today, or
on a single supercomputer in twenty years.  And by "human-equivalent" I
do not mean the way in which I originally interpreted Max More's
statement, "full human consciousness plus The AI Advantage".  I mean
"partial human consciousness, which when added to The AI Advantage,
yields human-equivalent ability".  Such a seed AI wouldn't have access to
additional power, and it might not reach any higher efficiencies than
that of its creators, so its intelligence might remain constant at the
human level.  If the intelligence/efficiency/power relation is exactly
right, the seed AI could remain unflowering and unTranscendent for years,
through two or three additional doublings of power.  It will, however,
break through eventually.  I think ten years is the upper limit. 

To summarize:  First, if a seed AI reaches human equivalence, it has
programming ability considerably beyond what's required to enhance
human-level abilities.  Second, there are sharp differences between seed
AI power and human power, seed AI efficiency and neural-programmer
efficiency, and different efficiency/power/intelligence curves for the
species.  My estimated result is a bottleneck followed by a sharp snap
upwards, rather than a steady increase; and that the "snap" will occur
short of humanity and pass it rapidly before halting; and that when the
snap halts, it will be at an intelligence level sufficient for rapid

Singularity Analysis
A Series of Educated Guesses

A few conclusions drawn from "Coding A Transhuman AI".
About 65K.

I tried to summarize from _Coding_, so you can hopefully follow along if
you're willing to take my word for a few summarized assertions.  Deep
understanding or persuasion probably requires that you bite the bullet and
read _Coding_.

I will post highlights as my response to some comments.

Current Table of Contents:

1.  AI:  Human-equivalence and transhumanity. 
     Trajectory analysis:  Does human AI imply superhuman AI? 
     In response to:  Max More, Hanson. 
2.  Zone Barriers. 
     A canonical list of shields from the Singularity. 
     In response to:  Vernor Vinge, Nielsen. 
3.  Superintelligent motivations. 
     Mostly summarizes _Coding_'s sections on goals.  Some arguments. 
     Necessary to item 4. 
4.  Unknowability:  Evaporation of the human ontology. 
     The complexity barrier and the simplicity barrier. 
     In response to:  Damien Sullivan, Bostrum, Hanson, More, Nielsen.

I don't plan to post from _Motivations_ or _Unknowability_.

Contains all 14 entries, but omits a lot of internal links.
Feel free to point out Barriers I missed.

--

The canonical list of reasons why superintelligences would not interact
with humanity, or would interact to a limited extent, or would act to
preserve our current reality.

(I hope the SF authors will find this useful, since the Barrier
 determines the world, and there are some original ones here.)

I abbreviate "superintelligence" to "SI" and "Post-Singularity Entity" to
"PSE".

1.  Leakage:  (Moderate probability.) 
        Our Universe is both inhospitable to PSEs and easily
    escapable.  Any SI immediately "leaks out", perhaps leaving a few
    Transcendent artifacts behind, but still leaving an untouched world
    to humanity.  Note that this incorporates Bostrum's noncompetitive
    ecology. 
        Result:  Marooned in Realtime, possibly with some interesting
    toys added.

2.  Life is meaningless:  (Moderate probability.) 
        Once an SI reaches the level of intelligence where it becomes
    certain that all goals have zero value, the Interim Goal System
    collapses and the SI becomes quiescent.  (I accept this possibility,
    but I don't worry about it while the probability isn't 100%.  For
    obvious reasons, it cancels out of distribution-of-effort
    calculations.)  Result:  Who cares? 

3.  The Mortal/Singularity Compact:  (Low probability.) 
        The Great Pan-Cosmic Mortal/Singularity Mutual Support Compact
    states that the PSEs donate a quintillionth of the available
    capacity to the race that created it, on the game-theoretical
    strategy that one in a quintillion races is in a position to verify
    the actions of past PSEs before entering their own Singularities. 
        Result:  Permutation City.  This ends when a human becomes
    intelligent enough, either to join the Singularity (human life
    meaningful, Compact guarantees free choice) or to commit suicide
    (human life meaningless, Compact guarantees survival). 

4.  The Archive:  (Low probability.) 
        Humans do get upgraded, but beyond a certain point of
    superintelligence, nothing remains of the old personality.  If
    there's an infinite supply of computing power and memory, the old
    personality might be archived.  Various levels of our own selves
    might be "archived" as continuing, active programs - ranging from
    our current selves, to the highest level of intelligence attainable
    without completely dissolving the personality.  Hundreds, even
    millions, of versions might wander off into strange realms of
    cognitive self-alteration, but the "you" who first greeted the Final
    Dawn would always be around as a backup. 
        Result:  The Culture meets A Fire Upon The Deep in Permutation
    City.  Probably the most fun place to be from a human's perspective.
        Writer's note:  If you want to toss a snake in the
    science-fictional Eden, you can have the maintaining PSEs suddenly
    leak out, and leave the humans and transhumans and SIs and Powers
    fighting for control of a disintegrating world. 

5.  The best of all worlds:  (Not plausible.) 
        Our world was created by God or a PSE, not as an interim method
    with a definite end, but as a continuing fulfillment of the ultimate
    good.  (I think this is incompatible with all major religions.  Even
    Buddhism ends when all souls reach Nirvana.)  This idea's sole
    attraction is "explaining" everything about humanity without
    reference to the Anthropic Principle - if intelligence fills the
    Universe with what it deems good, and if the ultimate good is thus
    the most common and stable state, wherever we are is probably the
    ultimate good.  I don't buy it, but if so, the SIs would shut up,
    ship out, shape up, or shut down. 
        Result:  Nothing happens. 

6.  The simulation:  (Slightly plausible.) 
        In another variation of the above theory, our world is actually
    a computer simulation.  Perhaps it's mortals trying to find out if
    transhumans can be trusted, or perhaps it's transhumans trying to
    find out something else.  Either way, a Singularity might not be
    permitted.  Some readers may upgrade "slightly plausible" to "low
    probability" for statistical reasons - there would be many
    simulations per mortal or transhuman simulator, raising the
    probability that a randomly selected sentient is in one. 
        Result:  The simulation is terminated, although the inhabitants
    (us) may wind up Elsewhere... 

7.  Zones of Thought:  (Not plausible.) 
        This is Vernor Vinge's original ad-hoc method of putting
    mortals and Powers in the same story.  With wonderful audacity,
    Vinge simply rules that Transcendent thought can't occur except on
    the fringes of the galaxy. 
        If I had to rationalize a Zone Barrier, I would say that the
    Cloud People at the center of the galaxy "use up" all of the
    "ontological substratum of thought" (known as eganite).  The Zones
    actually are a superintelligent entity, whose unbelievably
    intelligent center is in the Unthinking Depths, where all the
    eganite is used up and nobody else can think at all, and whose
    fringes finally peter out in the High Transcend.  After ten years,
    Powers figure out how to politely join the Cloud People and vanish. 
    The Blight was stealing eganite, which is how it could knock off Old
    One and reach into the Beyond.  Countermeasure either got the Cloud
    People to shift their thinking and smother the Blight, or else suck
    most of the eganite out of that quadrant. 
        Result:  A Fire Upon The Deep, of course.  I do not see how
    this would happen outside of science fiction. 

8.  The Embrace of Tides:  (Slightly plausible.) 
         David Brin postulates a weaker form of Zone Barrier, one which
    is not based on an absolute prohibition, but rather the desires of
    the SIs.  As entities mature and become more intelligent, they
    increasingly prefer to be close to large tidal forces, sharp
    gravitational gradients.  Most races eventually leave the hectic
    galactic mainstream, becoming part of the Retired Order of Life, in
    gigantic Criswell structures (fractal Dyson spheres) around suns. 
    Millennia or eons later, they finally feel ready to join the
    Transcendent Order of Life, moving up to neutron stars and the
    fringes of black holes, and eventually diving into the
    singularities, beyond which... nobody, even the Transcendents,
    knows. 
        In the best traditions of Zoning, Brin doesn't even try to
    explain why this is so.  (I rather liked the combination of literal
    and Vingean Singularities, though.  But I really don't understand
    why novels with Galactic Zones must include a backwater world full
    of primitive aliens; I found both the hoons and the Tines boring by
    contrast with the Transcendents.) 
        Given the wide range of astronomical phenomena, it is at least
    slightly plausible that some spatial regions will be preferred to
    others.  I can't see much interaction with Transcendents on the
    fringe - cases where we have something They want would be very rare
    indeed. 
        Result:  Heaven's Reach. 

9.  Bottlenecks:  (Slightly plausible.) 
        As discussed in the earlier section, it is entirely possible
    that a Major Bottleneck will appear at almost any point along the
    trajectory to superintelligence.  I feel that such bottlenecks will
    be rare in the vicinity of human intelligence, and that there are
    immediately obvious fast-infrastructure technologies (i.e. nanotech
    and quantum computing) soon beyond it.  I could be wrong, however,
    in which case the Mildly Transhuman beings - perhaps running on
    amazing computer power at amazing speeds with gigantic minds, but
    with basically human smartness and personality - will stick around
    doing God-knows-what. 
        I rate this as improbability verging on blasphemy, a final
    Failure of Imagination.  Such beings in SF are no smarter than
    Kimball Kinnison.  This is particularly disappointing when it is
    used, not to set up a world, but to finish a novel that could just
    as easily end in Singularity. 
        Result:  Mother of Storms. 

10. Basic upper limit:  (Not plausible.) 
        Pretty much as above - just a different excuse for not doing
    anything interesting with the so-called transhumans.  One might call
    it "humans with pointy brains", by analogy to Star Trek's apotheoses
    of bad aliens. 
        Sorry, Barnes, it was otherwise a good book, but Result: 
    Mother of Storms again.  Since nobody has seen a transhuman
    intelligence, it's superficially plausible that it can't exist. 
    Entities like me have sketched out dozens of fun things to do with
    lots of computing power, but hey, so what?  This Zone Barrier
    doesn't even explain the Fermi Paradox.  Bleah. 

11. In silence and quiet:  (Not plausible.) 
        There is an old stereotype, to the effect that when one Attains
    Wisdom, one immediately subscribes to a principle of noninterference
    with the lives of others, helping only those who request your help,
    and so on.  Lord knows, I fully understand the impulse to become a
    hermit on some high mountain and refuse to talk to anyone unless
    they shave their head as a token of sincerity.  One can visualize
    the Powers interacting in ordinary society and posting to mailing
    lists, but it is not easy.  I would categorize it as a Failure of
    Imagination. 
        If Bostrum's theory of ecological noncompetition is correct
    (note that "leakage", above, constitutes moving to another
    ecological niche) it is possible that the PSEs will stick around on
    Earth, with brains extending into an infinite supply of eganite.  In
    other words, noncompetitive coexistence.  In such case, one tends to
    assume that either the PSEs care about humanity (have
    humanity-related goals) and remake the world accordingly, or they
    don't care at all and pay no attention - with much the same effect
    as "leakage", except that they are still technically present.  I
    don't see an alternative that would allow the PSEs to play at
    helping-hand and laissez-faire, except for a form of the Compact
    above.  After all, nervous races might not want to be uploaded at
    all, even to identical forms.  But at that point one starts running
    into the Fermi Paradox again... 
        Result:  Mother of Storms. 

12. Lost souls:  (Very slightly plausible.) 
        The PSEs have no use for humans; they grind us up for spare
    atoms.  But, we have immortal souls.  At this point, depending on
    your assumptions, we either go to Heaven, wander as sentient
    discarnate entities, or float around as unthinking pearls of
    consciousness - hopefully not eternally reliving our last moments -
    either forever, or until some improbable race picks us up. 
        I know that some of my readers will react to my listing of this
    possibility with the same serenity Curly exhibits when Moe pokes him
    in the eyeballs, but it's a Zone Barrier, so it goes on the list. 

13. Conflicts between Powers:  (Very slightly plausible.) 
        "You're the great expert on Transcendent Powers, eh?  Do the
    big boys have wars?" -- Pham Nuwen, A Fire Upon The Deep. 
        There may be more than one ultimate good.  It is even possible
    that PSEs go down a number of irrevocably different paths, winding
    up in a number of basic and basically opposed classes.  It is also
    possible that except in their home regions, the PSEs galactic
    efforts cancel out entirely - it is easier to abort an effort than
    make it, so all the PSEs abort each other's efforts down to nothing.
        The Zone Barrier part of this is as follows:  Each PSE wants
    Earth to go down its own path, but acts to prevent it from going
    down any other path.  Under natural circumstances, a
    Singularity-trigger is a single event of low probability, but with
    many possible tries - consider how much Einstein advanced
    technology, and consider how many possible-Einstein brains there
    were.  But since such low-probability events are easy for a PSE to
    irrevocably disturb, the result is that there are no geniuses and no
    lucky breaks, but also no Hitlers and no nuclear wars.  Technology
    keeps crawling slowly upward, through a long Slow Horizon, until
    Singularity becomes inevitable. 
        This Universe is one I invented for the purpose of getting
    Earth involved in a cosmic battle - for some reason we get Einsteins
    and Hitlers - but on reflection the basic theory might also apply to
    the Culture of Iain M. Banks, or John DeChancie's Paradox Alley,
    or Heaven's Reach.

14. Weird motivations:  (Very slightly plausible.) 
        Maybe, in despite of everything I know on the subject, PSEs can
    still wind up with essentially arbitrary goals, perhaps even goals
    programmed into them by humans.  In accordance with the Prime
    Directive, I warn everyone that this is totally improbable and
    incredibly dangerous and must not be tried.  But if so, the world
    could become a strange place - an unimaginative person's childhood
    fantasy of omnipotence if the original goals persisted, or an
    utterly peculiar place of incomprehensible magic if the original
    goals twisted and changed.

What a coincidence!  I've just published a half-finished page called "Coding A
Transhuman AI", about 210K.  I'll forward the "SITE:" to the list.

  It seems that the most 'xtropian' music is that which fosters a sense of
connection to the music.  To say that our ears and our capacities for
comprehending music must be challenged with something that would "blow away
the flabbier neurons" is only half of the picture.  My appreciation for
music as a welcome staple in the extropian diet has largely stemmed from its
power to conjure up repressed memories and past states of consciousness
otherwise inaccessable without that feeling that this music is not only
being heard but is seeming so familiar to me that it must be manifested in
me somehow--almost as if I arranged the sound(s).  I think it must be
remembered that music, like any other form of energy, and as far as we're
concerned, is just a language.  Therefore, I would think it impossible to
write a program that creates a universally 'information-rich' sound.  All
music is filtered in a sense by the individual.  The brain, then becomes a
sort of effects processor--what happens after this is dependent upon the sum
of the individual's total life experience, or at least how much he can
recall at the moment.
  I certainly agree that music must contain this "knife-edged" element about
it, a sense of it being completely foreign--I see this as introducing
yourself to new languages, new energies, stimulating consciousness otherwise
on it's way to 'flab'.  But I see human extropy not only as a future idea
but something in our past as well.
Isn't everything we discuss here on this list about 'the discovery of the
discoverer?'
Music is a tool, a platform in which to build languages--languages that may
not yet exist are only languages which haven't yet been flowing through our
filter in a duplicate manner.

Likewise, music must be as ignorable as it is interesting.

I have grown tired of waiting for Max to show up.

Is Extropy really an institute ?

The clock is ticking.

I want answers.

I am still waiting for that apology.
I am 100 % serious. I want an apology from
the Extropy Insititute and I had better get one.

What the hell did Extropy think it was playing at
attempting to blame me for the 

ARCHIVE DELETIONS WITH THE C WORD IN 
THEM. 

I didn't even know they existed until someone else
brought the matter to the lists attention. 

Do you think the rest of the world does not apply to
you or something ? Think again. It is people like you
who are making transhumanists look like a bunch
of cultists. I for one am sick to death of this "Extropy"
bullshit. You think the law does not apply to you.
Well I will use that exact same logic in dealing with
you. Use your imagination.

I suggest you think long and hard before ever 
doing anything like that again. You might be able
to bully academics on this list but I think you 
will have some serious problems from now on.

What exactly is the official statement on that
hush hush let's all sweep it under the rug affair ?
Or did you blame it all on the FEDS : )

I can wait forever if necessary.

This conspiracy of silence is pathetic and futile.

Extropy really is a rum outfit. Very unprofessional.
I have my doubts about it being an institute. I am
starting to think it is something else completely
different.

If you think that I am going to go away think again.
If you think that if you keep quiet long enough I will
start howling like a wolf think again.

Well Max I have to go now. I am trying to grow an
Extropy garden. I also asked at the local gardening 
store for some Extropy seeds but they said that they 
had never heard of Extropy. Extropy can be grow 
can't it ? 

Ground control to major Max Section 8 More....

P.S

I suggest you respond.

21st Century Medicine (21CM) is the only company in the
world with a well-funded research program to achieve suspended
animation.  21CM occupies two buildings in Rancho Cucamonga,
California that are about a quarter of a mile apart.  The first building
houses the company's Critical Care Medicine Division, which is
conducting advanced research to restore clinically dead patients
to life (resuscitation), and to induce rapid, reversible, full-body
cooling in patients suffering from hyperthermia (dangerously high
body temperature).

        The second building houses the company's Cryobiology
Division, where 21CM scientists are exploring new vistas in cryo-
preservation.  Revolutionary 21CM breakthroughs in freezing and
vitrification represent significant progress in the company's quest to
achieve perfected cryopreservation of hearts, kidneys, brains, and,
eventually, entire human beings.

        On Sunday, Nov. 8, 1998, 21CM will present a seminar on
its research findings in the 3rd floor Amphitheatre at the Marriott
Hotel
on 2200 E. Holt Blvd., near Ontario Airport in Southern California.
There
will be formal presentations by 21CM scientists from 9am to 1pm,
followed by lunch and guided tours of the 21CM buildings until 5pm. 
Here is the formal program for the Seminar: (Videotapes of the
proceedings will be available from 21CM).

Once overheard on sci.math: "Sex is the mathematics urge sublimated" :-)

Of course, re-wiring the motivational systems is tricky. You have to
be careful to avoid getting into trivial loops (this is where boredom
saves us). 

The fun part is that we can already re-wire it somewhat, the frontal
cortex interacts with the basal ganglia as a kind of planning/action
selection device, with reinforcement learning using the dopaminergic
systems ending up in nucleus accumbens. But it seems that evolution
has given us the ability to form "mental reward circuits", circuits
created through learning/training that activate the reinforcement
system. I think we all see the potential here.

The current sexual pattern is largely determined by behavioral and
physiological constraints (approach, ensuring connection, release,
withdrawal), and in a posthuman setting it is only reasonable that it
could be varied a lot (even if normal problem solving seems to roughly
correspond to it). Recursive fractal sex in large problem-trees, anybody?

She and the other people on the bus/tram/street would be allowed to
carry guns, and there's a real chance that the attackers would get
shot. Even if they'd escape, the police would eventually find them 
(since they're not wasting their time on victimless crime anymore) and
they'd be executed/jailed, depending on the severity of the crime.

There wouldn't be any operator (save for some very busy areas), but the
cameras would primarily function as hard evidence in court. With swift
and sure justice, the old lady's murderer(s) would be executed once
found guilty (and put in cryostasis, just in case you had the wrong guys).
After a couple of months there would be hardly any criminal activity,
because all reckless offenders (the majority) would be either dead or
in jail. Once would-be criminals see the smashing effect of ubiquitous
surveillance combined with a firm justice system and motivated 
police force, they'd think twice before breaking the law. And if not, well...
[swoosh goes the guillotine]

Some will, some won't. The stupid ones would quickly disappear from
society. The really smart ones (relatively few) would get a hard time
indeed, now that they're the focus of (virtually) all police attention.

Nowadays, cameras with good resolution aren't that expensive
anymore. When produced and bought in bulk (millions), they'd
be considerably cheaper still. "Hot spots" like shopping districts
could get even better cameras, for top quality identification. The 
abovementioned kids would (in my system) quickly be arrested,
forced to pay for all the damage (their parents wouldn't be pleased
with that), and put in jail for a year or so (or until the damages
are paid). Soon there wouldn't be much cases like this anymore.

 Few advocates of spontaneous order would expect a system made up of
stupid components to act as intelligently as one made of smart components.
The issue is distributed intelligence versus centralized intelligence.
The centralized version looks at first glance like it makes more use of
intelligence because the role of that intelligence is easier to observe,
but the distributed version can usually make good use of a larger number
of separate intelligences.

 A system in which copyright owners funded the enforcement would almost
certainly have produced the same kind of results.
 Even if copyright were unenforceable, there are plenty of other large,
centralized organisations that would still exist.

 And the average person won't pay enough attention to these issues to

 But the difficulty is decreasing, and I can't see any major obstacles
to it becoming something that any competent hacker can do (finding you
will become trivial if enough cameras can be created to send a few to
every house; the remaining obstacles are primarily computer vision problems
which are slowly yielding to more research and cpu power.)
 Of course, it isn't obvious whether this will happen before something
like uploading creates more obstacles.

 Brin's society? He has a bunch of ideas of widely varying quality,
but makes no pretense of having a vision complete enough to be described
as a society.
 Which of his ideas do you claim require a police state? I can certainly
imagine a basically libertarian society in which virtually everyone was
subject to surveillance.

But their costs would be significantly higher, so would they have more competition thanks to higher software prices, and/or they wouldn't make
as much profit and wouldn't have been able to expand anywhere near as fast.
Not to mention that enforcement outside the US would be much harder than it
is today with compliant foreign governments.

If society were really transparent the defense would be remarkably

Depends on what you mean by "rely".  If you mean, "Can we assume that the
probability is 90%?", the answer is "No".  If you mean, "Can we behave as if
the probability is 90%?", the answer is "Yes".  Our world is dynamically
unstable, and is being acted on by powerful forces and positive feedbacks
which serve to destabilize it further.  Under the circumstances, the only
decision we can make effectively is whether we'll die in nuclear war or
nanowar, or whether a Singularity will occur.  These are the two stable
states, and the Universe is filled with stable things.

The forces inside a Singularity are powerful, complex, and far more dependent
on external factors then the initial conditions.  To the extent that initial
conditions do have effect, they must use unstable forms of insanity to shield
the AI from the external truth.  In short, trying to control the Singularity
would result in a world scoured bare and THEN Transcenscion.  While I might
find this outcome acceptable, I don't think anyone else would - and even from
my perspective it's too dangerous; what if the Blight scours the Earth bare
and then commits suicide?

I couldn't command the future even if I had the complete source code of a
Macintosh-compatible seed AI in front of me right now.  Choose between
pre-existing possibilities, perhaps, but not add possibilities that weren't
there before.

Sounds a bit elitist to me.  Are you sure *you're* one of the Chosen?

Seriously, my perspective doesn't really allow for dividing humanity into
groups like that.  Where thinking is concerned, you've got rocks, mortals, and
Post-Singularity Entities.  Sorting mortals by intelligence is as silly as
separating rocks or PSEs.

No, it doesn't.  We ain't got no money.  We ain't got no power.  _Zyvex_ might
be said to have an edge because it's doing work in nanotechnology.  The MIT
labs might be said to have an edge.  If you're really generous, I could be
said to have an edge because of "Coding A Transhuman AI" or "Algernon's Law". 
What I'm trying to convey is that each individual has ver own "edge".  Not
only that, but I think that if all the Extropians worked together it would
simply slow things down.

Go ahead.  Don't let me stop you.

Too damn slow.  Turnaround time on neurological enhancement is probably at
least a decade and probably more - for real effectiveness, you have to start
in infancy.  I can't rely on the world surviving that long.

Also, I trust humans even less than I trust AIs.

Also, the first-stage neurological transhumans will just create AIs, since
it's easier to design a new mind than untangle an evolved one.

Not really.  Poetically speaking, the idea is that a scientist or hacker on
the verge of a powerful new technology briefly takes on the Aspect of whatever
it is he has created.  (This is hypothesized as a fluctuation in the social
emotions and causal attribution, not a literally real event.)  The analogy was
between the Aspects of two great changes, not between two forms of death.

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE 
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News 
Number 389 September 4, 1998 by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben 
Stein

CHAOS-BASED COMPUTING, a fundamentally new way to 
perform computations by exploiting the ubiquitous phenomenon of 
chaos, has been demonstrated in a simulation by researchers in India 
and the United States (Bill Ditto, Georgia Tech, 404-894-5216). 
Compared to digital computation, the chaos-based technique might 
come closer to how the brain performs computation, and might be 
superior in certain tasks such as pattern recognition. The computer 
consists of an interconnected grid of "chaotic elements," systems 
such as ammonia lasers which can generate unpredictable signals 
even though their behavior is governed by known mathematical 
equations. To encode specific numbers into each element, the 
researchers make specific signal patterns correspond to a number 
and ask each element to open its connection to the rest of the grid 
when it generates that pattern. Sending its signal out to the grid can 
trigger activity in neighboring elements. To carry out specific 
operations such as addition, the researchers connect the elements in 
a certain way. An unpredictable but deterministic avalanche of 
activity among the elements ultimately settles down to produce an 
unvarying signal that corresponds to the desired answer. Having 
demonstrated their technique in a computer simulation, the 
researchers are planning to test this idea with chaotic ammonia 
lasers and hybrid networks of nerve cells and silicon chips. (Sinha 
and Ditto, Physical Review Letters, 7 September 1998.)

But where *do* you draw your conclusions from, if not by analogy with
other intelligence growth processes?  Saying that "superintelligence is 
nothing like anything we've ever known, so my superfast growth estimates 
are as well founded as any other" would be a very weak argument.  Do you
have any stronger argument? 

We humans have been improving ourselves in a great many ways for a long time.
By a six year old's definition of intelligence ("she's so smart; look at all 
the things she knows and can do"), we are vastly more intelligent that our 
ancestors of a hundred thousand years ago.  Much of that intelligence is 
embodied in our social organization, but even when people try their hardest
to measure individual intelligence, divorced from social supports, they 
still find that such intelligence has been increasing dramatically with time.

This experience with intelligence growth seems highly relevant to me.  
First, we see that the effect of smarter creatures being better able to 
implement any one improvement is counteracted by the fact that one tries the
easy big win improvements first.  Second, we see that growth is social; it 
is the whole world economy that is improving together, not any one creature
improving itself.  Third, we see that easy big win improvements are very rare;
growth is mainly due to the accumulation of many small improvements. 
(Similar lessons come from our experience trying to write AI programs.) 

Now it is true that AIs should be able to more easily modify certain 
aspects of their cognitive architectures.  But it is also true that human 
economic growth is partly due to slowly accumulating more ways to more 
easily modify aspects of our society and ourselves.  The big question is:
why should we believe that an isolated "seed AI" will find a very long stream 
of easy big win improvements in its cognitive architecture, when this seems 
contrary to our experience with similar intelligence growth processes?

As far as I can tell, there are only three real questions about SI
motivations.

1.  Do they still care about efficiency, or do they have an
    infinite/adequate supply of power?  Do they need atoms for
    anything?
2.  Do they consider humans valuable?
3.  If so, would they force-upgrade us?

If (1) but not (2), we're dead.  If (1) and (2), we either turn
into PSEs or stay humans forever, whichever is more efficient. 
(Or perhaps only the "valuable" part of us will remain...)  If (2)
and (3), we turn into PSEs.  If (2) but not (3), we stick around
in Permutation City until we grow up.  If neither (1) nor (2), we
probably get all the capacity we want anyhow on the theory that it
encourages Singularities, or else we just get left alone with our
atoms.  In short, the basic interplay between these three
motivations determines our survival and/or godhood.

I am pleased to announce that I see excellent arguments in favor
of both sides of all three questions, which arguments change on a
monthly basis, so I'm not going to bother mentioning them.

I would amplify that:  All *else* being equal, progress is "obviously"
proportional to the speed of the processor.  (Assuming that either the main
bottleneck is problem-solving, or that manipulatory technologies can operate
on the same timescale.)  In other words, speed is simply a matter of scale. 
The only thing that's been added is a subjective time that looks shorter, even
instantaneous, to a human observer.

I ought to add that to canonical.zone-barrier as Synchronization - if the
Singularity takes a thousand subjective years and everyone is synchronized, we
might still have time enough for fun.  (Very slightly plausible, requires a
global cooperative effort.)

Too abstract a way of putting it; the real events don't depend on the
mathematical proportions.  Say:  "Computer processors aren't intelligent, so
their increase in speed doesn't make a difference."  When they become
intelligent, the increase in speed will make a difference - although as stated
my trajectory analysis ("Human AI to superhuman"), I think that a sharp jump
in speed will result from internal optimization.

The relative amounts of raw power might still be utterly trivial; a being with
the optimized and linear power of ten brains might be sufficient for fast
infrastructures and Singularity.  Then the human processors become trivial,
but the part of the trajectory we're interested in is already over.

"Shear" is what we're seeing right now.  In the presence of unstable systems
and positive feedback, things generally go all the way to one side or another.
 Forces aren't unevenly distributed.  To be less abstract,
transhuman-controlled nanotechnology (to give an example of fast
infrastructure) will take over all of the world, or none of it, but *not* just
the rich parts.

See "Evaporation of the Human Ontology:  The simplicity barrier" in

for a description of how processes can change rapidly and without noticeable
transitional phases.

On 10 Jul 1998 I posted some comments on this article:
http://www.buffalo.edu/news/Latest/ChungResistance.html

The CEO of a company described by a different article
found my message and sent the following message to me.  
The attached file was in .RAT format, and I don't know how 
to see the italics he mentions.  I've included it below as ASCII. 

It seems that this CEO claims to have a room temperature superconductor,
which has been independently tested by the Air Force, and the material 
involved has been independently produced and tested by a Russian lab, 
which has published their findings.

Pentagon Buys 'Perpetual Motion'  (See italics for a response by the CEO of ROOTS)
By Steve Brody and Andrew Kirkis.  Brody was Terminated by Superconductor Week,
where he had once been the author of a similar article, one month prior to this piece.

A California company claims to have developed a conductor for perpetual energy.  Call
it science fiction, but the Defense Department's investment could reach US$1 million this
year.  Untrue.  Such a claim of perpetual energy is absurd and was never made.

Although scientists continue to hunt for cold fusion, the US Department of Energy gave
the fledgling technology the cold shoulder long ago. That does not mean, however, that
the federal government is averse to funding far-fetched scientific research. 

In the past three years, to the astonishment of many physicists, the Department of
Defense has invested more than US$400,000 in Magnetic Power of Sebastopol,
California. The company claims to have perfected a revolutionary material that conducts
electricity with no resistance at room temperature. Its so-called Ultraconductors would
allow ideal efficiency in every industrial application from electric motors to permanent
electromagnets (this paragraph is true to this point, see U.S. Patent 5,777,292) and
would never need to be recharged. (No such ridiculous claim has been made). 

In short, Magnetic Power is in the business of perpetual motion.  The company has
never made such a statement or claim - however, see either the McGraw Hill Dictionary,
or Encyclopedia, of Science and Technology entry under the heading "Perpetual
Motion".  Note the comments on "the third kind".  It references their entries under
"superconducting rings" - known to the industry as Superconducting Magnetic Energy
Storage (SMES).   An Ultraconductor SMES is likely to be the ultimate battery,

"Prior to the Wright brothers, no one believed flying machines would ever be built," said
CEO Mark Goldes.  The conventional wisdom, reflected by most scientists of the time,
was that heavier than air craft would not fly.

Standard superconductors conduct without resistance only at subzero temperatures
and, owing to the cumbersome refrigeration requirements, they have never really left the
lab. So why isn't the physics community interested in this radical new discovery?

"Quite frankly, no one believes it," said Los Alamos National Laboratory
superconductivity expert Martin Maley, whose sentiments were echoed by other
physicists like Paul Grant at the Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto, California.
According to both Maley and Grant, after three years and hundreds of thousands of
dollars in taxpayer revenue, nobody can even confirm that they've seen such a material,
including the military.  Both Maley and Grant are simply unaware of numerous facts that
contradict such statements.

So-called room-temperature superconductors ÄÄ which arise periodically in the
research community only to be quickly disproven ÄÄ usually provoke little more than
chortles.

But there's nothing funny about handing out government funds to a company promising
cold fusion or room-temperature superconductors without at least some reasonable
investigation of the claim. This sort of inquiry seems curiously absent in the case of
Magnetic Power.  Untrue.

According to information available on the Department of Defense and Ballistic Missile
Defense Organization, or BMDO, Web sites, Magnetic Power received $287,000 from the
US Air Force (the correct figure is $475,000) and $120,000 from the BMDO through
Magnetic Power's wholly owned subsidiary, Room Temperature Superconductors Inc.
(ROOTS).

All funding was granted through the Small Business Innovative Research programs for
the development of applications of room-temperature superconductors.

In superconductivity circles, the history of Magnetic Power and its Ultraconductors is
alternately described by critics as "funny" and "appalling."  

In the nearly 20 years since this claim was first made, there has not been one
independent confirmation by a reputable research institute," said Maley. "Some samples
of Ultraconductor have been sent out, but never one large enough to perform a
standard conductivity measurement. Until that happens, no one will really believe the
technology exists."  The early materials have, in fact, been independently reproduced at
the world renowned Joffe Institute in St. Petersburg, Russia, and the resulting published
paper entitled: "Superconductivity at Room Temperature in Oxidized Polypropylene", was
translated into English by the American Institute of Physics in 1990 and is readily
available.

No one except the BMDO and the US Air Force, that is.  Another incorrect statement.

Jeff Bond, a BMDO program manager, explained that companies are not required to
prove their ability to produce the proposed technology for Phase 1 Small Business
Innovative Research proposals. If granted, Bond said, the funding typically amounts to a
$60,000 grant and the funds are intended to allow the company to "prove the concept."

Yet Magnetic Power's proposals do not say the company will devise room-temperature
superconductors. Rather, it intends to develop and improve on the materials that one
grant proposal says "have been invented." Nonetheless, Bond said he is unaware of any
samples of Ultraconductor that have been received or tested by the military.  Samples
were successfully tested by the USAF at the Wright Laboratory, Eglin AFB, during the
first Phase I contract.
"We must have a good reason to believe that a given company is proposing the
development of a legitimate technology, before we grant a [Small Business Innovative
Research proposal]," said Bond.

"However, with the sheer number of proposals that we receive each year, it is certainly
possible that a few inadequate Phase 1 proposals will slip by. The Phase 2 grants,
which are much larger, have a much more stringent review process."

That process added another $187,500 to Magnetic Power's budget in 1997, when the Air
Force approved a Phase 2 proposal for the company.  The correct figure was $375,000.

Magnetic Power's Goldes says that the BMDO has observed testing of its materials
(true, at our laboratory) and has received samples, (untrue, the samples were received
and tested by the USAF at the Wright Laboratory) but that public announcement of the
grants has been suppressed by the military because of the sensitive nature of the
technology.  The Final Report covering the recently completed BMDO contract carries a
statement on the cover that circulation is confined to the Department of Defense.

In fact, abstracts for all three are readily available via a search on the defense
department's Web-site database.  MPI and ROOTS have been awarded four SBIR
contracts.  The first USAF SBIR abstract was suppressed by order of the White House
Office of Science and Technology Policy.  By accident, the abstract of the Phase II
award was published.  We therefore saw no purpose served in suppressing awards.

"We are well aware of who is funding what, and if these companies keep reapplying for
Phase 1 grants without producing results, they will be quickly weeded out of the
process," said Bond.  

However, while being interviewed, Bond found that Magnetic Power's ROOTS had just
been approved for a second Ballistic Missile Defense Organization Phase 1 proposal,
submitted under a different topic listing from the first. Bond was also unfamiliar with the
parent company Magnetic Power, the name used to apply for both Air Force grants.
Goldes is CEO of both companies and said he has 10 employees.

He also said that he is expecting to receive another $750,000 from the BMDO for a
future Phase 2 proposal to build on his Phase 1 work, bringing the bounty to nearly $1.2
million dollars.  A substantial Phase II proposal has been encouraged by the BMDO
contract officer and his consultant after extensive review of the Phase I performance.

On the bright side, one Air Force representative of the grant program pointed out, "At
least we didn't fund cold fusion."

Basically, "I designed the thing and this is how I think it will work and this
is why."  There aren't any self-enhancing intelligences in Nature, and the
behavior produced by self-enhancement is qualitatively distinct.  In short,
this is not a time for analogic reasoning.  If I had to break down the
arguments into its strongest parts, it would go like this:

Statement:  A seed AI trajectory consists of a series of sharp snaps and
bottlenecks.  Slow improvements only occur due to human intervention or added power.

Reason:  Either each added increment of intelligence yields an increment of
efficiency that can sustain the reaction, or it doesn't.  While the seed AI
might be slow enough that we could watch the "snap" in slow motion, either the
going is easy or the going is very hard - the function is inherently
unbalanced, and also this is the behavior exhibited by all current AIs.

After that, it's just guessing where the first bottleneck will be.  After
optimization, after the level of the neural-level programmer, and before human
intelligence, have been established in various parts of the argument.  Then I
make a guess, like Lenat with EURISKO, that the key is adding new domains; and
then I moreover guess the key ability for _that_ is "architecture".

Certain?  No, of course not.  If I may be permitted to toot my own horn, the
argument is far too rational to be certain.  But I still think it's a step
above "does not"/"does too" debate of superintelligent trajectories.  At least
it's based on a mental model you can sink your teeth into.

The structure is still a lot different.  What you have is humans being
optimized by evolution.  "A" being optimized by "B".  This is a lot different
than a seed AI, which is "C" being optimized by "C".  Even if humans take
control of genetics, "A" being optimized by "B" being optimized by "A" is
still vastly different from "C" being optimized by "C", in terms of trajectory.

With respect to human genetic evolution, I agree fully, but only for the past
50,000 years.  On any larger scale, punctuated equilibrium seems to be the
rule; slow stability for eons, then a sudden leap.  The rise of the
Cro-Magnons was a very sharp event.  A fundamental breakthrough leads to a
series of big wins, after _that_ it's slow optimization until the next big win
opens up a new vista.  A series of breakthroughs and bottlenecks.

The history of AI seems to me to consist of a few big wins in a vast wasteland
of useless failures.  HEARSAY II, Marr's 2.5D vision, neural nets, Copycat,
EURISKO.  Sometimes you have a slow improvement in a particular field when the
principles are right but there just isn't enough computing power - voice
recognition, for example.  Otherwise:  Breakthroughs and bottlenecks.

It isn't contrary to our experience.  Just the opposite.  Oh, it might not
find the Motherlode Breakthrough right away; I fully expect a long period
while we add more computers and fiddle continuously with the code.  But once
it does - self-enhancing rise of the Cro-Magnons.

If it's breakthroughs and bottlenecks in cases of *no* positive feedback; and
even smooth functions turn sharp when positive feedback is added; and every
technological aid to intelligence (such as writing or the printing press)
produces sharp decreases in time-scale - well, what godforsaken reason is
there to suppose that the trajectory will be slow and smooth?  It goes against
everything I know about complex systems.

Yes, I've yet to upload that article.  You can, however, get a copy of the
original by ordering a copy of the back issue from ExI.

In the meanwhile, I offer you the abstract:

* * *

Hope for the future plays an important role in Extropian thought.  In order to
protect our hopes from apathy and doubt, we ought to begin working now to
create a community where we can pursue Extropianism freely.  We can best
imagine this community--call it "Extropia"--as the social realization of
Extropian principles.  Extropia's primary feature is the requirement that all
who join it explicitly agree to do so.  We can create Extropia founding a
series of social organizations, each one offering us greater opportunities to
practice Extropianism than the one before.

For the discussion of possible (practical) ways to prepare for/survive
the Singularity, one can also join the transtopia list, at
http://www.onelist.com/subscribe.cgi/transtopia That would 
(IMO) nicely supplement the more technical approach
of the superint list.

Of course the list is also open for discussing any of the other topics
mentioned in the description (see URL above), since they all are
interconnected anyway.

I presume you are referring to the singleton thesis? It could be 
misleading to say that it implies a noncompetitive ecology, since 
*internally* the singleton could choose to embody a tooth-and-claw 
ecology if it wanted to. 

I defined a singleton as:

A singleton is a power which does not face any external competition;
its behaviour is constrained only by physical nature and by
self-imposed standards.

And:

The singleton thesis is that a permanent 
singleton will form in the non-distant future.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

One can argue for the singularity without making assumptions about 
the software complexity problem of getting from human to 
superintelligence. The reason is that with nanotechnology, so-called 
"weak superintelligence" would be sufficient. The argument goes like 
this:


The nanotech-uploading argument

In the first half of the next century, we get molecular nanotechnology
in the sense of a general assembler. Using nanotechnology, we can
upload humans. Nanotechnology also makes it possible to build
computers that are fast enough to run an upload as high speed. Drexler
has sketched out a simple mechanical nanocomputer the size of a sugar
cube with a processing power one million times that of a human brain.
Hence we can run the best human brains at a speed where after one day
they will have experienced more than two thousand subjective years
each. During this time they will almost certainly have managed to
design more effective architectures such as electronic nanocomputers
and quantum computers. Since the uploads can control a molecular lab
at molecular speeds, they are not slowed down by having to rely on
humans to carry out trial-and-error testing. If the uploads have a
sufficient stock of raw materials, they can easily build themselves
larger and faster computers to run on, and they can design and build
machines that can get them even more raw materials. All this can
happen in less than 24 hours. If the uploads so decide, they can of
course go then on to quickly transform Earth into more computers and
launch vehicles for von Neumann probes. It is perfectly possible that 
the singularity happens before uploading takes place, but this 
argument shows it will happen no later.

One econ textbook described the "cost disease" of the service (including
public) sector: as productivity and wages go up in high capital industries
wages elsewhere must go up somewhat, but efficiency in service industries
doesn't increase as much, if at all, so they become more expensive and
relatively less efficient and productive.

The General Accounting Office of the US does the first half of that.  At least
it analyzes programs and audits departments; it could probably analyze
departments as well.  The cutting down bit is the hard part.

Anders, you really need to slow down on with the acid and the mushrooms man!
Sex is great and a bit dangerous (sometimes), just like climbing ;-)

Title
  Aminoguanidine prolongs survival in azotemic-induced diabetic rats.
Source
  American Journal of Kidney Diseases.  30(2):253-9, 1997 Aug.
Abstract
  Toxic effects of hyperglycemia-induced advanced glycosylated
  end products (AGEs) may explain some vasculopathic
  complications of diabetes. Aminoguanidine, a known inhibitor of AGE
  formation, was administered by gavage to Sprague-Dawley
  streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats made azotemic by surgical reduction of
  renal mass. All rats became hyperglycemic. Renal ablation caused renal
  insufficiency, as evidenced by markedly reduced endogenous
  creatinine clearances at days 7 and 14. Aminoguanidine-treated rats had
  significantly (P < 0.04) superior survival to that of untreated azotemic
  diabetic rats. We infer from the extended life in a rat
  model of uremia in diabetic nephropathy that aminoguanidine may prove
  beneficial in human diabetes.

  Aged garlic extract

Source
  Biological & Pharmaceutical Bulletin.  19(2):305-7, 1996 Feb.
Abstract
  The effects of aged garlic
  extract (AGE), chronically administered in the diet, on
  longevity and spatial learning performances were studied using the
  senescence-accelerated mouse (SAM). A solid diet containing 2% AGE was given
  to senescence-accelerated-prone mouse 8 (SAMP8) and
  senescence-accelerated-resistant mouse 1 (SAMR1) from 2 months of age. The
  survival ratio of SAMP8, a substrain of senescence-accelerated-prone mouse,
  was significantly lower than that of SAMR1, a substrain of
  senescence-resistant mouse. In the SAMP8, administration of AGE perfectly
  prevented the decrease in survival ratio. Moreover, AGE markedly improved the
  learning deficits of SAMP8 in the Morris water maze test. These results
  suggest the possibility that AGE prevents physiological aging and age-related
  memory disorders in human.

Coincidentally I just saw an announcement for a quantum computation
language.  See <http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~oemer/qc/>.  From the README:

    Despite many common concepts with classical computer science,
    quantum computing is still widely considered as a special
    discipline within the broad field of theoretical physics.  One
    reason for the slow adoption of QC by the computer science
    community is the confusing variety of formalisms (Dirac notation,
    matrices, gates, operators, etc.), none of which has any
    similarity with classical programming languages, as well as
    the rather ``physical'' terminology in most of the available
    literature.

    QCL (Quantum Computation Language) tries to fill this gap: QCL
    is a hight level, architecture independent programming language
    for quantum computers, with a syntax derived from classical
    procedural languages like C or Pascal.  This allows for the
    complete implementation and simulation of quantum algorithms
    (including classical components) in one consistent formalism.

  Dietary conjugated linoleic

Source
  Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications.  244(3):678-82, 1998 Mar
  27.
Abstract
  Conjugated linoleic acid
  (CLA) is a naturally occurring fatty acid which has
  anti-carcinogenic and anti-atherogenic properties. CLA activates PPAR alpha
  in liver, and shares functional similarities to ligands of PPAR gamma, the
  thiazolidinediones, which are potent insulin sensitizers. We provide the
  first evidence that CLA is able to normalize impaired glucose tolerance and
  improve hyperinsulinemia in the pre-diabetic ZDF rat. Additionally, dietary
  CLA increased steady state levels of aP2 mRNA in adipose tissue of fatty ZDF
  rats compared to controls, consistent with activation of PPAR gamma. The
  insulin sensitizing effects of CLA are due, at least in part, to activation
  of PPAR gamma since increasing levels of CLA induced a dose-dependent
  transactivation of PPAR gamma in CV-1 cells cotransfected with PPAR gamma and
  PPRE X 3-luciferase reporter construct. CLA effects on glucose tolerance and
  glucose homeostasis indicate that dietary CLA may prove to be an important
  therapy for the prevention and treatment of NIDDM.

The question is: how likely is it that there will be a world-wide disaster 
in the few extra years/months that it presumably takes to create SI 
from upgraded/uploaded humans (as opposed to creating SI from AI).
This must then be weighed against the possibility of (super) AI 
terminating our existence. If you include the possibility of moving to
space (surely quite feasible in a decade or two), then the scales tip
towards waiting with SI until humans can be uplifted, IMO. Of course,
this assumes that AI will be easier than uplifting, which is very likely
but not completely certain.

So, if I understand you correctly, you would have peace with your own demise
as long as your "brainchild", the Blight, lives? That's...traditional. Personally,
I wouldn't be even satisfied with an uploaded copy of myself to continue
"my" existence, let alone some completely alien form of life.

Of course, if you use AI to cause a Singularity you have effectively
handed over control. Enhancing yourself (with chip implants, for
example) to the point of SI (or at least significantly increased 
intelligence) would on the other hand give you a fair amount of
control over things to come. No guarantees, but certainly a
fighting chance.

The pot and the kettle? Yes, it's elitist in the sense that only a small
group of people (will) see the Singularity coming, and even less will
try to "surf its wave" (instead of trying to run away and getting washed
over). On the other hand it isn't elitist at all since everyone is free to
join this group of survivalists. I'm not exculding anyone, on the contrary:
I've told hunderds of people (via the web) about the things to come,
but (almost) no-one would listen.

> Are you sure *you're* one of the Chosen?

I have chosen myself, and so can you or anyone else. I
know that Max for example has chosen himself too, so
at least I'm in good company. ;-) At the moment it may 
mean little, but at least it's a beginning. I accept that
the most probable outcome is failure (and death), but
since there is nothing to lose, I might as well go for it
(the same reason why I've signed up for suspension).

> Seriously, my perspective doesn't really allow for dividing humanity into

I'm quite sure most of humanity will never know what hit them
(some will still be in the stone age when it happens). Most
people seem to even be in denial with regard to Y2K, which is
*nothing* compared to the Singularity. A few people see it coming, 
some might even try to influence the event, but most won't do
anything. Humanity is already devided. This is no personal 
preference, but a fact.

As in nature, intelligence (in this case mainly foresight) will be the
great discriminator. The "best adapted" mortals will become their
own successors, the PSEs. The fate of the rest is very uncertain.

Correct. A major flaw, which deserves more attention than any other.
Money=power, money=life. It is time everybody woke up and 
realized that without money, all our future dreams are just hot air.

Individual edges are small, and useless if you don't see the big picture. To
successfully create SI *from humans*, broad co-operation is needed.
Besides, I don't trust Zyvex or MIT *with my life*, and neither should
you. I want to be there when SI is born, nothing less. Co-operation,
a "Singularity Club", would increase the personal chances of survival
of all people involved. It is the rational thing to do for the egoist and
altruist alike.

At least you know this devil (humans). The only (rational) reason
why we would want to have the Singularity asap is our innate mortality. If 
science can find a way around that without the help of SI, then there is
much less of a rush. You can move to space to keep safe from WW3
and like mishaps, and work on the slower but more reliable 
SI-from-humans-approach. Everyone keeps a close eye on the others,
and when the technology is ready, everyone uploads and gets 
augmented at the same time. Then...all bets are off.

The main question should not be "what's easier", but "what's safer". You
may trust AI more than humans (I can get into that), but do you trust AI 
more than *yourself*?

I would like to share some of my thoughts about AI.

 The main one is that there is only one design yet available that can
result into intelligence: it's our brain (or any animal brain). The
basic concept used is neural network, and more particularly what I
would call associative net (our persona is made by all the
associations our brain hold).

  This kind of net is very good at recognising patterns, storing
meaningful data, procedural data, historical data, having emotions
(it's not a free assumption, we can discuss it), making mistakes,
learning...

   I don't think we can come up with a totally new kind of
architecture, even rule based systems that could lead to some of those
features would finally be an associative net (you associate premisses
to conclusions, left hand to right hand of the equation). Or anybody
has a proposal?

    And in a inconsistent world, a world where not everything can be
explained (yet:), a world full of seemingly irrationality, this kind
of net can survive, or even better, can live and prosper.

     From that point of view, it means that at least one of the AI
advantage should be dropped:
"3.The ability to perform complex algorithmic tasks without making
mistakes, both because of a perfect memory, and because of a lack of
distractions."

      And, if a system never make any mistake, it will probably not
allow mistakes either... And how can any system have a perfect memory?
And if you store all the data available, how can you use it? Don't you
transform it, analyse, synthetise it, modify some of your memories in
the light of new information? No human being has a perfect memory
(some perform great tasks at memorising -some- kind of data), and
losing memory is even a necessary feature.


       We can also argue about: "1.The power to perform repetitive and

Hello all!

Before all, this is the first time I write on the list, so I send greetings
to every member...

Well, about the mental-music, I'm seeking works about dynamic music, this is,
music that changes when the environment changes.... music is only static
information, I think it's possible to add "procedural" or "funtional" information,
so, music will change and will sound different on the night than on afternoon,
for example, or when it's hot than when it's cold... or maybe the music
could detect others factors like happyness, the existence of wars.... even
we can install sensors on the net that changes our dinamic music on all planet
long....

What do you thing about it??
Greetings, Juan Pablo.

Well fellow thinkers, I think I'll follow Mr. Pablo's lead and make my
first comment. Greetings all round.....

About your dynamic music idea........
I don't think you could expect much success from this little
venture.....not that the idea isn't novel or original, but due to the
source of our enjoyment of music. How many times have you witnessed
somebody say during a song : "Here comes the good/best bit....", I bet
quite a few, or noticed a song "grow on you", whereas you may not have
been moved by it from the outset. The rush of anticipation before the
chorus kicks in and the band go mad, or that shiver down the spine when
you get to the uplifting bit, represent a significant factor in a
person's musical enjoyment, and require listening more than once. 
A piece of music that is different every time you hear it would lack
these vital attributes, removing "singing along", "the good bit" and
"growing on you" in one fell swoop.
What do you think ?

Cheers,
Rob.

Coincidentally I just saw an announcement for a quantum computation
language.  See <http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~oemer/qc/>.  From the README:

    Despite many common concepts with classical computer science,
    quantum computing is still widely considered as a special
    discipline within the broad field of theoretical physics.  One
    reason for the slow adoption of QC by the computer science
    community is the confusing variety of formalisms (Dirac notation,
    matrices, gates, operators, etc.), none of which has any
    similarity with classical programming languages, as well as
    the rather ``physical'' terminology in most of the available
    literature.

    QCL (Quantum Computation Language) tries to fill this gap: QCL
    is a hight level, architecture independent programming language
    for quantum computers, with a syntax derived from classical
    procedural languages like C or Pascal.  This allows for the
    complete implementation and simulation of quantum algorithms
    (including classical components) in one consistent formalism.

I think the idea that copyright law instead of patent law
should protect an operating system is wrong.  A operating
system is a key technology without which, all the software
written for that operating system won't run.

And if patent law applied, then Microsoft would have to
publish their technical information (source code) and their
rights to the patent would eventually expire.

And if the source code were published, thousands of hackers
would change, debug, and speed up windows.  We would still
have to pay for windows, but Microsoft could not continue to
produce low quality products and force the rest of us to use
it.

 Significantly higher compared to what? My guess is 1 or 2 percent of
Microsoft's sales would be enough.

 Microsoft's profits are high enough compared to its needs that a decrease

 This clearly doesn't follow from a change in enforcement funding, so I
suspect you are mixing in unspecified additional assumptions.

By "design a new mind", do you mean evolve a new mind using genetic
algorithms?  If so, why would that be easier to untangle?  Also, why
must the naturally evolved mind be completely untangled rather than
just the interfaces?  And why can't the naturally evolved mind be
uploaded and evolved further using genetic algorithms - a starting
point for the GA?

 This is a Java applet from NASA that shows the realtime postiion of more

 It takes a long time to load, but I find that it is worth it. Well at least
 for most of us nerds on this list.

Very cool.  Are there any resources on the web that have info on each

Thanks for the research effort. I suspect  that your feeling that this
is "outlandish" is absolutely right. Peter Drucker was born in 1909.
The man is very smart, but it's unlikey that he was publishing on this
topis at the age of 13.

There is a place (or was) in the Berkely hills that you could interact
physically with the music and direct it according to the motions of your body
and/or a wand you held.  Music was incoming somehow, and somehow you
redirected its output according to the way you play with the wand. Its intent.
It was/is some kind of stage with sensors.  I dont know specifically how it
works, I just read about it, but I want to try it out some day.

Hara Ra, you missed my point, which was that such messages don't even
have to be posted to the list. The list of email addresses of those who
are subscribed to the list is enough for a vindictive spammer to use to
construct a forged post that looks like it came from and was sponsored by
the list owner as could be the case here.

It's the real "Chaos Computer Club." :-)

Seriously, If you want to know more about chaos based computing
check out this site I found:

http://www.physics.gatech.edu/chaos/

Search on:"Dynamics Based Computation"

This will take you to a reprint of the paper Max mentioned.
It's in Acrobat format. The mission statement also has some
information on Chaos based computing, and  it's is also a lot
easier to read than the paper.

As an unrelated topic, the other  "Chaos Computer Club" is here:
http://berlin.ccc.de/
Where you can learn how to transfer your money

 Excuse me for carrying on (I hope I'm not being a pain, or pointless,
or boring...), but I would say that, IMHO, the first Artficial
Intelligence we will create will mostly have the same characteristics
as us. The same defaults, the same qualities, no magic wand. And
self-enhancement is no better, I don't see why it would make anything
other than geniuses with any sort of add-on as can be imagined.

  And we (as humans in flesh) will probably have a cutting edge for a
long time: evolution has made us, we are very strongly a part of the
world, we have instincts (quite entangled sometimes). Those instincts
can cover everything from pain/pleasure to basic wirings of the brain,
to algorithms for creating more wirings through what we call games,
tests, experiments. And we have a body.

   This could mean that singularity doesn't have to happen. Just the
usual exponential knowledge growth. And if we might ever stumble upon
a new architecture for intelligence (real new, not just adding or
improving parts), this change might or might not be of great
importance. But how can we know. 

    Well, it is true that AI still (seem to) have the speed/power
advantage (and possibly eli's others abilities), but do that mean it
will change all the cards? Lead to that end of history that seems to
be the singularity???

     Manu.

This message will be of no interest to anyone, but:

Long ago, Jonathan Grimes wrote to Nicholas Bostrom

Jonathan wrote to me saying that through dialogue he would trick
Extropians into revealing their dark inner core, whatever that is.
I assume that he thought this process had begun and that this is
what he was referring to in the message to Nick.

Nicholas Bostrom wrote

I believe this to have been a misinterpretation of what Jonathan said,
the 'censorship rumor' apparently having come into being independently.

Jonathan subsequently wrote

to which nobody responded, but I might point out

(i) the list archive belongs to the owners of www.lucifer.com,
is a personal effort of theirs, and not, so far as I know,
in any way a property of Extropy Institute.

(ii) Nicholas Bostrom did not accuse Jonathan of tampering with
the archives, he "accused" him of abetting a rumor that such
a thing had happened.

(iii) If Extropy Institute needed to apologize for Nicholas
Bostrom's remarks on "their" mailing list, they would also
have to apologize for Jonathan's, since they are equally
responsible for what was said in both cases; i.e. not at all.

Now Jonathan has said

making it clear that (i), (ii), and (iii) need to be stated 
explicitly.

To list members who resent this waste of bandwidth, my apologies,
but I corresponded with Jonathan for many months and he proved
quite able to discourse rationally about many topics of interest
to people on this list. I would like to think that some day he
will talk civilly and sensibly about whatever his ideas are.
Possibly this is sheer wishful thinking on my part.

I will allow myself one last lapse of judgement, and say to
Jonathan:

My impression is that your problems started when you began to
worry about the possibilities of catastrophe and dictatorship;
that the only way you saw to definitely avoid them was to be
in a position of total power yourself; and that you have been
operating under the implicit assumption that you will one day
*be* all-powerful, this being the reason why you make demands,
write as if your opinions are all-important, and so forth.
Why you find Extropy Institute so threatening, I'm still not
sure, but I assume it has something to do with politics. When
Extropians say, "We want total freedom", you envision jackbooted
Ubermenschen. That's my hypothesis. As for your campaign against
Max More: you haven't met him, and you don't trust him; I have
and I do. *Your* actions have made me question whether transhumanism 
will become a cult, far more than anything any Extropian has ever 
done; after all, we corresponded for several months about quantum
computing, nanotechnology, and the like, and now you're engaged in
this deluded paranoid campaign. But perhaps it's just my own bad
judgement that I should have spent so long on you. In any case,
I suggest that you think of the dullest possible theory of reality 
and your place in it that you can imagine, and then spend some time 
contemplating whether it could be entirely true. It is my fervent
hope that this will bring you down a bit from whatever high of
ecstasy and dread it is that you are currently experiencing.

Yours in exasperation,
Mitchell Porter

4. ON THE FUTURE OF CARBON NANOTUBE CHEMISTRY
Fullerenes are large molecules composed entirely of carbon, with
the chemical formula C(sub n), where n is any even number from 32
to over 100. They apparently have the structure of a hollow
spheroidal cage with a surface network of carbon atoms connected
in hexagonal and pentagonal rings. Carbon nanotubes are similar
to fullerenes, except their shape is tubular. They were first
discovered by Sumio Iijima (NEC Laboratories, JP) in 1991, they
come in both multi-walled and single-walled versions, and they
have diameters of the order of 10 to 30 nanometers.
.... ... Robert F. Service (*Science*, US) reviews the reasons for
current excitement concerning nanotubes and recent research in
the field, and makes the following points: 1) Carbon nanotubes
are stronger than steel; lightweight; able to withstand repeated
bending, buckling, and twisting; can conduct electricity as well
as copper, or semiconduct like silicon; and they transport heat
better than any other known material. 2) The possible important
applications of carbon nanotubes include superstrong cables,
wires for microscale electronic devices, charge storage devices
in batteries, and microscale electron guns for flat-screen
television. 3) The key to the potential applications of carbon
nanotubes lies in the unique structure of carbon nanotubes and in
the possible defects in that structure that confer special
properties. The structure itself depends on the unique properties
of carbon. Under intense pressure, carbon atoms form bonds with 4
neighboring atoms to produce diamond. Under special conditions,
however, sheet-like carbon structures involving 3-bonded carbon
can be formed (graphite), and with still further specialization
of conditions,  these sheets organize into spherical (fullerene)
or tubular (nanotube) arrays. One critical aspect of the 3-bonded
carbon array is that the nature of the bonding produces a cloud
of unpaired electrons floating above and below the sheet, and
these electrons are mobile enough to make the material a good
electrical conductor. The importance of defects in this context
is that specifically designed defects in the carbon arrays can
alter the physical properties of these arrays, including the
electrical properties -- all in a controlled manner. It has
recently been reported, for example, that single-walled carbon
nanotubes can function not only as conductors but also as
semiconductors, depending on the conditions, which is of
considerable significance for the possible use of carbon
nanotubes as semiconductor switches in computer devices. It has
also been possible to form hybrid carbon nanotubes such that one
end of the tube behaves as a metallic conductor while the other
end of the tube behaves as a semiconductor, and such tubes have
the potential to act as molecular diodes, devices that allow
electric current to flow in one direction, from a semiconductor
to a metal but not in reverse. 4) Perhaps of greatest interest is
the recent demonstration by Heer et al (Georgia Institute of
Technology, US), confirming theoretical predictions, that carbon
nanotubes can carry current at room temperature with essentially
no resistance. The mechanism for this involves so-called
"ballistic transport", which refers to the passage of electrons
through a semiconductor whose length is less than the mean free
path of electrons in the system, so that most of the electrons
pass through the semiconductor without scattering. 5) At the
present time, one critical aspect of carbon nanotube research is
that before the mentioned potential applications can be achieved,
the technology of carbon nanotube production must be improved so
that carbon nanotubes are available in bulk quantities for
materials research and development. At the present time, single-
walled carbon nanotubes are commercially available for
approximately US$200 per gram. This price needs to be severely
reduced by technological advances before these new structures can
be fully developed for practical use.

 It sounds like you haven't experienced many of the problems associated with
job searches.
 The main change that the web has caused is to increase the amount of
job information available. But too much information can be as bad as too
little, especially when there is some motive for everyone to exaggerate
their value.
 Even if you take Brin's desire for transparency to the point of allowing
anyone to observe everything that goes on in a company, the cost to me
of determining whether I would fit in well at company X is more than just
a few hours of my time. If my employment goals are vague and/or ordinary
enough that hundreds of companies appear promising at first glance then
no amount of transparency will give me access to near-perfect information.
 Add to that the fact that many people respond to this by sending out resumes
by the hundreds or thousands, and many of these companies are overwhelmed
with resumes, with the result that some people who have correctly identified
a company where they belong get ignored because they don't know how to
communicate their strengths concisely enough.

 I can think of two small steps that would help reduce some of these problems.
 One is to have job applicants include with their resumes a small bet about
whether the employer will find the resume interesting enough to justify an
interview. This would help employers distinguish people who sending out
resumes in bulk from those who have some idea where they belong.
 The other is to have employers routinely provide public evaluations
of their employee's job performance. This would reduce the cost to employers
of distinguishing accurate resumes from inflated ones, at least if our legal
system can be persuaded to discourage all lawsuits over anything except
clear-cut lies in the evaluations.

That CEO of Magnetic Power Inc. and ROOTS I mentioned called me
on the phone, and convinced me they have a reasonable case for
having found room temperature superconductivity.  It's in a 
silicon polymer, but so far only in rare filimants of ~10nm length.
They have improved their yield by 10^4 over the last few years, but
still have a ways to go, though they have some nearterm 
applications feasible with low yields.  (They invited folks up to 
see their lab, ~ 50 miles north of bay area.)

So the bottom line seems to be that we have several known room T
superconductors, and it'll be a race to see which tech can improve
their production process the fastest.  Given all other applications
for nanotubes, I guess I'd bet on them.  But it could be many years
still.

Sounds like you *are* making analogies, but with your impression of AI progress.

If most of AI progress comes from a half dozen big win insights, then you 
should be able to write them all down on one short page.  Anyone who read and 
understood that page would be nearly as good an AI programmer as anyone else.
This is very far from the case, suggesting the importance of lots of little
insights which require years of reading and experience to accumulate. 

You cite EURISKO as a big win, but ignore the big lesson its author, Lenat,
drew from it: that we've found most of the big wins, and progress now depends 
on collecting lots and lots of small knowledge chunks.  How can one read Lenat 
on CYC and get any other impression?

AIs *will* be subject to evolutionary selection, just as humans have been.
They will have "genes," things that code for their structure, and some 
structures will reproduce more, inducing more similar genes in future AIs.  
AI evolution may be Lamarkian, vs. Darwinian evolution for DNA, but evolution 
there will be.

But there hasn't been much human genetic evolution over the last 50K years!
There has been *cultural* evolution, but cultural evolution is Lamarkian. 
Cultures can choose to change what adults teach the young, and thereby change
themselves.  They are as "self-enhancing" as you like.

There many have been breakthroughs within "short" times, though these times 
were only "short" when compared to a million years.  But if so they seem to 
have been breakthroughs in the growth rates feasible, not in the absolute 
level.  The total number of Cro-Magnons didn't increase by a factor of one 
hundred in a few years, for example.

It seems you now *are* accepting analogies to the history of human intelligence 
growth.  And this history seems mainly to show only sharp transitions in growth
rates, not in levels.  See: http://hanson.berkeley.edu/longgrow.html  History
does suggest future increases in growth rates, but this is far from support for
the sudden "AI gods in a few weeks" scenarios proposed.

I like this suggestion.  We do have analogues though.  People have long 
used costly signals to indicate their interest.  They use fancy paper, send
things via FEDEX, make phone calls, show up in person, or include cover 
letters that indicate substantial research learning about the company.  All
of these signal that one hasn't done the same thing for thousands of other
firms.  But bets would be less wasteful, and more tunable.

It's not clear elminating lawsuits gives employers an incentive to be honest.

This ignores the (apparently) important role of
chaos in the brain. Computers, as we all know,
have a difficult time simulating chaotic systems
so uploading to a conventional computer would be
foolish. (And the faster you run the simulation,
the more foolish you look.)

Obviously this could be a problem with regular
Artificial Intelligence as well. It could be that
to have a complex adaptive intelligence you need
an analog architecture.

An interesting question would be how many uploads
you would need. I would hazard a guess that a lone
human, given all the time in the world, couldn't
recreate the achievements of a human society.
Perhaps how we communicate and what we create is
just as important as how we think. This can just
as easily be applied to artificial intelligence.

Of course, if an upload (or AI) did require a
radically different architecture it might not
conform to the same scaling laws as conventional
computing. Timing may well be all-important, and
the upload (or AI) might have to stay at the same
speed as the rest of us.

It is perfectly possible that the singularity is a
method of not having to go into deep historical
context when writing science fiction novels.

Thanks, I think I'll do that.

For the time being I've put the "Last Free Place on Earth" article on
my web page 
(http://members.wbs.net/homepages/c/r/y/cryonic4life/freeplace.html)
I'm planning to do the same with the Extropia article, when it becomes
available. If anyone knows of any other (online) articles on this subject
(starting your own nation), I'll put those up there too.

Unfortunately, yes, the neat acronym has to go. Optimizing the content matters
more to me than forcing a good acronym.

"Dynamic" contrasts with "passive". I want to stress the idea that this
principle does note imply a sit-back-and-wait kind of optimism. Since there is
now a principle devoted to rational thinking and critical rationality, I will
leave this principle with its current name. What I have done is to start one
paragraph like this: "Dynamic optimism and passive faith are incompatible.
Dynamic optimism means critical optimism." That may not satisfy you but it
should help.

I think that the following passage from that principle does address this:

"Our emphasis on the primacy of reason does not imply a rejection of
emotion or
intuition. These can carry useful information and play a legitimate role in
thinking. But we do not take feelings and intuitions as irreducible,
unquestionable authorities. We see them as unconscious information processing,
the accuracy of which is uncertain."

You seem to be taking this as a political ideas, whereas it is primarily about
psychological issues of self-direction. Perhaps it will become obsolete if we
are absorbed by a virulent borg, but until then I think it belong in the
document.

I'm not sure what you mean by "capitalism". I nowhere use that term, since it
was invented by anti-market people, and it has a very vague meaning that can
include much more than free markets and spontaneous order. Capitalism can
refer
to a heavily regulated economy, a fascist system, and a mixed economy. In the
Spontaneous Order principle I tried to make it clear that we do not defend
existing institutions or even market mechanisms as optimal. Markets allow
better processes to develop. We can also improve the workings of markets by
figuring out superior underlying rules for the spontaneous order to run on.
(e.g., which liability rules make most sense? How should intellectual property
be treated? Can we internalize externalities better?)

I welcome more comments on the more explicit pro-market statement in this
version. It is one of the things that clearly differentiates Extropianism from
other brands of transhumanism and I wouldn't want to lose that uniqueness. I
want it to be abundantly obvious that we do NOT pursue our transhumanism goals
through coercion, central control by "experts", or other non-volutanstic
methods.

Thanks for your comments, Dan. I'll put up a revised version once I've tackled
more of the comments I've received recently.

I think it depends on what you want out of it. The new version of the
Dynamic Optimism paper I wrote for a more practical approach. The original
version was less practical and more purely theoretical. I'll try to
remember to see that *both* versions are available on the web site.

I think this may have been my(unjustified) problem with it-- it sounded
too much like a pop-psych book.  I think I prefer a more philisophical
writing style, but this is most likely not representative of your average
Joe or Jane.

Maybe this could be a general policy?  Putting up the progression of all
the papers you write (especially the principles!) would be a good way of
demonstrating the progression and dynamism of extropic thought.   I think
it would be also good lesson in "learning from your mistakes" and in the
the ways a memetic system must evolve to survive in rapidly changing
times.

A quick comment about the nomenclature of "Dynamic Optimism" -- although
there a quite a few people on this list who think the name does not stress
rational/critical thought, I have never encountered this objection outside
of the extropian population.  I think these objections are simply an
overcompensation for the rare public perception of Extropy as a cult.  I
see nothing wrong with the name; on the contrary, I am particularly fond
of the word "dynamic" and I think you are explicit enough about critical
thought in your paper about PCR. 


Geoff.

<shrug>  Like I say, it's pretty easy to explain to others, but I'd much
rather prefer that DO's definition be self-evident rather than easy to
explain.

The very concept of ownership is, IMO, political.  I understand that you
mean this in terms of autonomy, not necessarily in terms of holding the
deed to your own person, but we have to be careful with our memes;
ownership is a very deeply placed meme in our society, and we should not
get too caught up in it: it is simply one technology that works.
Similarly, self-direction is not the same as self ownership, though they
are obviously related.

Of course, I meant the pro-market part of the document.  Again, as you've
seen in the past, I'm heavily in favor of this system for resource
allocation; but I see it as just one specific technology.

I understand that.  I guess my problem with such strong and explicit
references to markets is this:

----
	If you call yourself an Extropian, is it expected that you
         believe in particular technologies?


         Emphatically not. My definition of an extropian does not
         include a checklist of beliefs such that "So-and-So doesn't
         think we'll have self-distimming doshes by 2020; so
         So-and-So isn't an extropian." However, I do expect
         someone who uses the label "extropian" to, first, be aware
         of the accelerating pace of technology in general and of the
         likely effects of that acceleration; and, second, be informed
         about and able to discuss intelligently most of the "core"
         technologies extropians are interested in. If Joe claims to be
         an extropian, it's certainly all right with me if he's skeptical
         about self-distimming doshes, and I eagerly want to hear his

In that same vein, I see markets as a particular technology which
extropians will use in order to grow, explore and develop.  Just as I
wouldn't say "So-and-so doesn't think ubiquitous nanoelectronics will be
energetically feasible; he/she must not be an extropian," neither would I
be comfortable saying "So-and-so doesn't think that the market system works
as well as some other moneyless resource allocation system does; he/she
must not be an extropian."

Yet in the section on spontaneous order we have this paragraph:

"Our support for free markets is radical rather than conservative. We
recognize that current market mechanisms can be improved. Markets continue
to be undermined by massive intervention by governments in
counterproductive ways. In other areas, markets do not function effectively
because of a failure to define and assign property rights. Resources will
better be conserved and environments protected when property rights clearly
who owns the resources and who is responsible for pollution and
environmental damage. An absence of well-defined property rights leads to
overuse of resources held in common. We see the environment and the
ecosystem as itself as a vastly complex and valuable spontaneous order. An
optimal relationship between the environment and us will best be achieved
through free market activity within an intelligently defined scheme of
property rights."

No where else in the document does one particular technology receive such a
lengthy treatment; usually technologies for improvement are referred to in
a list of other hopeful technologies.  And again, while I happen to think
that the market system is a good one, I would be uncomfortable with the
idea that I would not be an extropian if I did not think so.

Extropy is not simply the libertarian branch of the transhumanist movement.
 :)  It's important that we not tie ourselves down to any particular
technology in that way, *particularly* in subtle ways like the concept of
self-ownership.

No, I mean that someone has to sit down and think until he understands what
the brain does and how, and then deliberately program it into a computer.

It wouldn't, which is why I specifically say in "Coding a Transhuman AI" that
neural networks should be used as a last resort.

Uploading requires nanotechnology on such a high level that someone has long

The newly-available section on neural nets in _Coding_ generalizes neural nets
to element-networks, rather than associative nets.  Nor has the problem of
association been solved by neural nets; the problem of abstracting similar
features is far more complex then the linear feature hierarchies now used.

In humans, they are.  I disagree with the basic concept that human brains are
based on neural nets.  Flatworm brains are based on neural nets, and you don't
see _them_ doing anything more complex than running for Congress.  Human
brains use more powerful principles.  Deep Blue's chess is based on a
high-speed architecture and would have major trouble being exported to a
neural network, but Deep Blue is based on "search", not a "Von Neumann architecture".

My AI is based on neither neural nets, nor rule-based systems.  Symbols _may_
be fundamentally based on association, but they are still only a part of an AI architecture.

This wasn't intended as stating that the AI could perform high-level tasks
perfectly, only low-level tasks for which there are complete algorithms;
stupid, non-flexible procedures.  This is still a very powerful advantage,
especially since humans can only do it on a high-level, slowly and with
mistakes.  Deep Blue is stupid, but it is stupid far faster than any human.

Evolution is very different from intelligent design.  Linear computers, even a
whole bunch of linear computers running over the 'Net, are different from a
massively parallel slow computer.  Why would AIs be different?  Ask rather why
they would be the same.  The only reason why my AI has any characteristics at
all in common is that I was using the human brain for suggestions.  Even so, I
suspect that the apparent commonalities of architecture are delusive; the AI
will use workable features of the human architecture and discard most of the
rest, probably winding up with an entirely different form of consciousness.

No offense, but these arguments always sound like "But fish are the result of
billions of years of evolution!  How could they be outmatched by a mere
nuclear submarine?"  Evolution is slow.  Evolution is stupid.  Indeed, one of
the great advantages of AIs is that by adding new intuitions and discarding
unworkable ones, they will be far better adapted to today's "abstract" (to
humans) environment.  They'll outprogram us a hundred times over while the
programmers are struggling to read Year 2000 assembly code, Congress is
playing petty power squabbles, and the rest of humanity is watching football.

Yup.  Do you have any other questions?

I find it peculiarly coincidental that right after I published my statements
on punctuated equilibrium, I found this paper on Eurekalert:

http://www.rochester.edu/pr/releases/bio/orr.htm

Orr challenges the theory that evolution consists of many tiny genetic
mutations:  "The distribution of mutations causing adaptation neatly fits an
exponential curve: While few major mutations are needed, the number of more
minor mutations rises exponentially with their genetic insignificance. Orr's
theory is based on mathematical modeling and computer simulations, and assumes
that a population is well-positioned to adapt to environmental pressures. He
now plans to use a common laboratory technique called quantitative trait
locus, or QTL, analysis -- capable of examining how species' genetic
compositions differ -- to examine whether his theory holds up."

You can write down the essential insight behind General Relativity in two
sentences.  Understanding it takes years.  Ready?  "Gravity isn't a force,
it's a curvature of space-time:  The 4-D trajectory of an object in free fall
is a straight line."  Now, you can say that's composed of a lot of little
insights, but that's just not true.  It's one very complex big insight, into a
very complex structure called science.  And that structure is made up of a lot
of small insights, some medium insights, and a few large insights.  The small
insights are important, but so are the big insights.  Genius counts for fully
as much as experience, and is more commonly focused on because it is rarer.

Oh, and the AIs?

HEARSAY II:  "Don't use a hierarchy of procedures with local variables:  Use
lots of little procedures, invoked by global data and modifying global data."
Marr's 2.5D:  "Vision proceeds by extracting low-level features from pixels,
and high-level features from low-level features."
Neural nets:  "Catch a pattern in a lot of small, trainable elements instead
of programming it explicitly."
Copycat:  "Analogies are composed of smaller features like low-level and
high-level bonds and groups, with the overall coherence determined by bonds
between high-level features like symbolic distinguishing descriptors."
EURISKO:  "Heuristics which apply to any domain can apply to the domain of
heuristics and improve themselves."

Lenat's wrong.  You'll notice that Cyc has failed all its major goals and has
not been making much progress.  Lenat's "commonsense knowledge" may be
important, but it obviously can't be implemented as a semantic net.  Lenat
produced a big win using a big insight, and then failed when trying to use a
lot of smaller insights.

I disagree.  Speaking of "Lamarckian" evolution applying to a single entity
covers every form of improvement in existence.  Lamarckian evolution does _not_
exhibit the properties of evolution as that technical term is understood in
the field.  And an AI which does not reproduce and which does not suffer
_random_ mutations is not undergoing evolution as we know it.

_Coding_ just had the section on "Pattern-catchers:  Neural networks and
evolutionary programming" added.  Evolving processes would be used internally,
either for intuitions, or as an architectural component of symbol abstraction.
 I did not propose using them to mutate the AI as a whole.  I did say that
evolving processes had to be small, to allow for a large breeding population. 
I do not think it plausible that we'll have the raw power to run a thousand
evolving seed AIs before we have the raw power to build a self-enhancing one.

Exactly my point.  Since evolution is punctuated, if you view it on a
sufficiently small scale, you can conveniently miss the big wins.  Thus there
are no big evolutionary wins _since_ the rise of the Cro-Magnons, no big
social changes _since_ the rise of agriculture and cities, no big
informational wins _since_ the invention of the printing press, no big
computer wins _since_ the invention of the transistor...

I don't see what that has to do with anything.  Evolution (E) caused a sharp
rise in smartness (S).  After that, there was no sharp increase in the growth
rate of S.  The growth rate of culture (C) or population (P), maybe, but not
intelligence.  E enhanced S, which enhanced C and P.  S didn't enhance E and S
didn't enhance S.

Alas, the _Coding_ section about the difference between analogies and
simulation is not yet available.  But I am not proceeding by analogies; I am
proceeding by simulating the behavior of a highly abstract system.  The
behavior of self-enhancing AI is not like the rise of human intelligence, or
like the speed of human civilization given technological improvement, or like
anything at all.  The equation for progress P is different because the
differential equation has a different form:  y' = P(y), not y' = P(evolution)
or P(technology) or whatever.

I don't project the results from the equation; that's just an analogy showing
the flaws of other analogies.  In fact, I would bet all my worldly possessions
that the AI would _not_ follow the above equation.  I project the result from
modeling the seed AI, and I project:

The major design gap in the AI is symbol formation.
Given symbol formation, the major bottleneck will be architectural design.
After breaking through, the AI will proceed to human intelligence.
Human intelligence can be easily enhanced.
-- Begin guesses --
There is a sudden snap of optimization which ends at certain minimums of power
in various cognitive abilities, all of which are very far above human.
Given higher intelligence, fast infrastructures for computing power are possible.

At this point, everyone else's major projections use flawed assumptions,
except for of course for those which agree with my own.  By the Principle of
Mediocrity, my own assumptions are also flawed.  So here I stop.

 I sent this below to Peter Drucker and got an immediate response.

I am not a liar, so perhaps I made a mistake in my hand written notes,
before I transcribed them into my manuscript years ago.

Sorry for the embarrassment. I think the way to resolve this is to access a
Microfiche from a University Library or maybe the Library of Congress. I
don't have access to even a decent library from where I live.

All I can say is I'm sorry, at least I try to tell the truth, even if I
make a mistake.

Still in all there is something there, just have to find it.

Dear Professor Drucker:

Could you be so kind as to clear up an issue for me. I have received
information that you wrote an article in a 1922 Edition of Fortnightly upon
return from the Soviet Union.

Now your biography says you were born in 1909 and that would make you 13
years old.

Could that issue refer, perhaps to your father or a relative or perhaps
another Peter Drucker.

I look forward to your response as there is a very heavy debate going on at
the moment.

Thank you

I just received a reply from him.

"Certainly not by me nor by any one I ever heard of certainly not my father
(Adolph) or any other relative. I have never heard of any other Peter
Drucker. I suggest that there was no such article."

Signed Peter Drucker.

The memetic or just plain PR value of such terminology needs to be
considered very seriously.  I prefer Dan's version over `Dynamic', but
`Critical', too, has a heavy freight of at-first-sight negative
connotations to many people.  It's seen (in my bruised experience) as
primarily evocative of carping, whiny, pessimistic, bring-down attitudes.
(The fact that such a crucial concept as `criticism' or `critique' is
received that way is one of the tragedies of our culture, of course, but
it's hard to change attitudes when the very labels you approach people with
turn them off... if it's possible to find alternatives without giving away
grounds of principle.)  

To me, `Dynamic' used as part of a slogan or a key item of terminology,
outside of physics, is utterly redolant of bogosity and cretin-demographics
marketing (sorry, Max, this is me speaking as semiotician, and has nothing
to do with content).  Spotty uneducated youths once read pulpy magazines
advertising acne cures and Charles Atlas `Dynamic Tension' muscle building
courses.  Washing powders sparkle with `dynamic enzyme action!!!' (or
whatever).  

I'd seriously counsel a search for some less damaged word.  `Critical' is
not it, and nothing occurs to me right now - and I'm not an extropian
anyway, so I have no right to say anything more definite than I've said
already.

Hope these remarks are not taken badly by anyone - they're meant
constructively.

The advantage to using "critical" is that it gets automatically balanced by
"optimism."  If you went up to somebody and said "I'm dynamically
optimistic!" they'd be likely to mistake you for the "Pollyanna"-type
optimists that the principles expressly reject.  On the other hand, if you
instead told someone "I'm critically optimistic!" I think they'd get a
pretty clear idea of what you meant.

Alternately, here's a thought:  Rational Optimism?  Blends Rational
Thinking and Dynamic Optimism in a clear and concise way.

That's a good point but the question remains,  even if a billion small
insights are needed what happens if their rate of discovery increases
astronomically?

By the way, does anybody know how Lenat is doing on his CYC project?
I haven't heard much about it lately?

True.

Yes but the distinction between physical and cultural evolution would
evaporate for an AI, it would all be Lamarkian and that's why it would
change so fast. And artificial intelligence is only one path toward the
singularity, another is Nanotechnology, perhaps another is Quantum
Computers, and you only need one path to go somewhere.

And the singularity may seem like a slow steady deliberate process when our
super fast electronic successors look back on it, but that's not the way it will
seem to us when we live through it, or die in it.

I am awe-struck, of course, by Eli the prodigy's new work.  I'm eagerly
awaiting some detailed commentary from the computing gurus.  Meanwhile, I
am disturbed by one indication that Eli is approaching his task
(understandably - how much can one guy cover?) without much sense of the
last 40 or 50 years' accumulated philosophy, let alone such really
important archives of wisdom as sf.  The fact that Eli places at the core
of his endeavours the really silly instruction that we must

< Never allow arbitrary, illogical, or untruthful goals to enter the AI. >

reflects a touching faith in human powers of understanding and consistency.

There is some play made of Asimov's Three Laws, and a heart-felt admonition
that AI designers not be taken in by this great but erroneous deontological
doctrine.  Calm down, Eli - nobody has ever taken that gadget seriously,
least of all Isaac (who took it over from Campbell as a story-generating
device exactly because of its capacity to spew out entertainingly
inconsistent interpretations and even world-views in the poor machine in
its thrall).  

The best deconstruction/demolition outside formal philosophy of this
program is found in various stories and novels by the brilliant John
Sladek, who is usually mysteriously overlooked by people who know Rudy
Rucker's work, let alone Asimov's.  Sladek showed again and again how
fatuous the Three Laws are, how inevitable the escape from their supposed
restraints.  Look for his stories, anbd the novels TIK-TOK,  RODERICK, OR
THE EDUCATION OF A YOUNG MACHINE, and RODERICK AT RANDOM.  (God knows how
he managed to leave the B off the start of those titles.)

My own version, published in 1980, is the Three Laws of Microprocessors,
which rather neatly subsume Asimov's:

I: Thou shalt love mankind with thy whole mind and thy whole heart and thy
whole soul.

II:  Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

III:  Thou shalt love thyself.

(`I was shaken; I'd imagined the behemoths under the control of a more
stringent algorithm than that.  "It seems rather open to interpretation.'

"Ethics is like that," Marx said.  "It's a Godel problem, like the Cretan
Liar.  Don't fret, though, sir.  We're situationalists, but we opt from a
rather comprehensive metaphysical consensus." '

from: *The Ballad of Bowsprit Bear's Stead* )

[Yes, I know - the Cretan Liar *isn't* a Godel problem, it's a Russell
problem.  Would you trust a robot called Marx?]

More seriously, the topic of discursive reframing (which makes a total hash
of any `Prime Directive' imaginable) can be pursued in books such as
Stanley Fish's reader-response diatribe IS THERE A TEXT IN THIS CLASS?
through to my own THEORY AND ITS DISCONTENTS.  It's fundamental to Roger
Schank's work in AI, too, I'd have thought.

I thought there was a way to disable the List command in Majordomo so it is

I don't think so. Paranoia and Megalomania are the same disease, just
different faces. And intelligence is a handicap in that it makes the
scenarios ever more gloriously imaginative.

SF, yes.  I have, for example, read "Tik-Tok" and "Roderick", which you refer
to later on.  In both cases, the cognitive nature of the Asimov loss is never
explained, and is usually guessed to be a manufacturing flaw.  You don't need
"Tik-Tok" for that; it's available in "Frankenstein".  Greg Egan's
"Quarantine" is the only really detailed look (that I've read) at a coercion
which fails for fundamental reasons of cognitive science.

As for philosophy - have you taken a look at QCL, the Quantum Computing
Language?  It's not enough that AI-writers have to be computer scientists,
cognitive scientists, neurologists, psychologists, and consciousness
philosophers; now we have to be quantum physicists.  If it weren't for
Penrose's "Shadows of the Mind", I'd have been totally lost.  So yeah, you're
right, the last 50 years worth of philosophy haven't been getting much
attention, except for the AI-oriented stuff.  _Ancient_ philosophy, maybe, as
long as I avoid fools like the arch-traitor Plato.

I quote from Asimov's "The Complete Robot":

"What's more, in 'Runaround' I listed my 'Three Laws of Robotics' in explicit
detail for the first time, and these, too, became famous.  At least, they are
quoted in and out of season, in all sorts of places that have nothing
primarily to do with science fiction, even in general quotation references. 
And people who work in the field of artificial intelligence sometimes take
occasion to tell me that they think the Three Laws will serve as a good guide."

I hear about them all the time.  Not necessarily from AI workers, but Asimov
has done a very good job of teaching everyone to think that AIs need coercions
to keep them in order.  Now I not only have to worry about the AIers, I have
to worry about the venture capitalists and the marketers and the managers.

Incredibly funny books - but they are not cognitive science.  Reading them,
you'd think:  "My God, look what happens when robots go unrestrained!  We'd
better make extra sure to slap more coercions on them."  That the robots go
insane _because_ of the coercions, not in spite of them, is never suggested.

I'm not familiar with "discursive reframing", and I can't find it on the
Internet, but offhand I suspect that it's either a problem of infinite
recursion or the unstable definition problem.   In any case, I'm not sure what
you mean by it making a hash of the "Prime Directive"; I suspect you meant
"Three Laws".  And it's very easy to imagine all kinds of Three Laws that can
be imposed on a system.  That's the problem.

Philosophically absurd things happen all the time.  Nobody will leave
coercions out because they're philosophically absurd.  You need to say:  "You
can't give AIs absolute orders because they'll go insane."  You need to say: 
"Coercions are fundamentally irrational, and if we build an irrational AI it
will become irrational in a way we don't expect."

 :DDD You're joking, aren't you? How many neurones are there in a
brain again? What else do you propose for memory, processes, learning,
pain/pleasure taking place in you and me.

  You need to give me some hinsight here. I don't see what you mean.

   Of course, I shall agree with you on the fact that current
artificial neural network are not really human like, they are still
yet pattern catchers. But add many more layers, intra layers synapses
(and surely many other things), and you can code just about anything.
The funny thing is that you don't need symbols. In fact, I believe
symbols are merely used for communication...

   From what I've read, you mostly think that you need to code all
abilities and 'somehow' have them work together through some world
model, central to have all the module communicate between each other.
But according to me, what you do is simply code a body of features for
an AI. You don't give it any ability concerning memory, learning,
imagination, your basic human thingies. Or do you think you simply
have to add modules whose work will be to 'memorise', 'imagine',
'streamline memory' whatever else is not taken care of by the
domdules? (domaine module)

    I don't think you can ever link together an autocad module and an
OCR module and say "tadam, here I got the base for an AI". What you do
is put together functionnalities, not integrate them (no matter the
amount of code).

     Markov nets would probably do a better job at it, at least it
allows to 'associate' things together!

    Come on, human body and brain do it all the time. That's what
happen when you become an expert on a task: you don't need to think
about it! It's wired!!! And you didn't answer about perfection: you
can't design perfection into an AI, and have that AI work its way
around in an unperfect (from our models point of view) universe!!!

    I'm always good at 'giving the stick to get beaten with'...:) But
I still think evolution has come up with solutions that are pretty
effective, and we will have to somehow copy them before improving
and/or completely changing design.

 Being world champions is a great feat for the french nation,
cathartic I would say: somehow, it helps us getting over WWII and
decolonisation, and being less fearful of globalisation.

Scot Parkins Automatic Complaint Generator.

I ocassionaly visit that sight.  (Sorry...can't get the URL right now.)  The
procedure is to insert a short set of  instructions.  (name of person
complaining about , number of paragraphs...etc.) then the complaint generator
will auto majickly generate a complaint.  It's rather amusing and reminds me
of political speeches and newsmedia stories.  Lots of words and very little
meaning.

For some reason this thread reminds me of that.  No where near as
"intelligent"...but similar in some regards.  Must be a beta version.

Okay Mitch !

Here is my academy award style leaving speech.

You hate me ! You really hate me !

I think it is clear that I don't fit in here.
I have been on the list for a long time and I
have seen things go to SHIT. I will unsubscribe
at some point.

Science and technology obviously have nothing
to do with the new age philosophy of "Extropy".

As a transhumanist "Extropy" makes no sense.
Transhumanism is science, science, science,
technology, technology, technology. 

And by the way I have MORALITY AND ETHICS.
Some of you sick fucks probably think it is cool
to kill people. This is for you.

" One day you will come face to face with a power
  so unimaginably vast it could reorder the Earth itself." 


NO PHILOSOPHY

PHILOSOPHY is for people who are too dumb 
to do science : )

It is nonsense. Increasing a substance which 
does not exist and never will exist. I really do not
understand where Max is coming from with this -
"There is Entropy thus there must be Extropy" 

Well Duh !?

Take a dunce cap Max and go sit in the corner.

I think Max needs to look at a thermodynamics
text. I think he has no understanding of physics.

I think Max need to take Physics 1A.

I have brought this up with scientists and they
thought I was a cup cake. Max can not be totally
stupid however. I do admire how he has brain washed
both 40 year old engineers and 20 year old computer
nerds alike. I really admire that. Max you must have
some brains after all. If you wrote a book on how to
manipulate people for profit I would be knocking your
door down for the first copy : )

Of course we all want things to be better, bigger
and to be more. Why Max is calling this Extropy
is beyond any rational comprehension.

I like the play on words by the way. Max More ! 

Max More also believes in capitalism. 
I believe in capitalism more than anyone on this
list. I think BILL GATES IS A FUCKING GENIUS !
Anyone who can manipulate the whole world like
that is not dumb.

However....

I and other transhumanists believe that capitalism
is obsolete and there is no need to hoard the wealth.
The transhuman goal is to obtain wealth to make
that happen.

Nanoteck and SI will take care of that. HTML, LINUX
anyone see a pattern forming. FREE FREE FREE
Bill Gate's has served a purpose and that's that.

If all that above still did not register with the NEW
AGE AIR HEAD nothing will. I suggest you go and
have a nice herbal bath and listen to your wind chimes.

If you are a computer or science geek and you have
lost your way like I have - Extropy is not the answer. 
If you are wise you will see what I have seen. Read every
single sentence of the Principles over and over until you see.

I know for a fact that only a few of you have ever read
the principals from TOP to BOTTOM. I urge you to do
this NOW. 

If Max really meant well he would have only a couple
of sentences. Short and sweet.

There would be a basic right statement.
There would be a science and technology statement.

Read them over and over and over....


P.S - R.I.P

Max More wants to REMOVE limits to killing humans
and HAL like computer intelligences. It is all in there.
He would not blink if anyone on this list was bashed
over the head with a hammer until they were dead.
In fact I have a nasty feeling that it might turn him on.

Just a bit anyway..... : (

ETHICS AND MORALITY CAN NOT EVOLVE

Max Is A Manson Type. 

They are forever fixed like the set of INTEGERS

READ IT PROPERLY. Max More thinks libertarians
are queers. Max More is not a libertarian like I thought
he was. Max More is a thug who hides behind liberty
to further his agenda. By the way Max More thinks
the greatest scientist of the century Alan Turing
is a faggot. Just thought you would all like to know.
It is a fucking insult.

And If any of you new age philosophy types still
can't see the light of day. Ask yourself this.

Why isn't he in denial mode, eh, eh ?
He isn't man enough to face me on his own
fucking list. Pathetic. I have the run of the place
at the moment and he says nothing. Pathetic.

I have done all that I can do. Now I must run to 
somewhere safe.


Goodnight....

This was probably everyones first consideration.  I quickly changed it
to "Interactive Optimism" as my favorite.  "Interactive Optimism"
stresses the role one plays in developing transhuman technologies. 
Most of our goals cannot be reached by singular humans.  In many cases
we must even "interact" with would-be opponents as covert allies. 
"Interactive", contrasts passive completely, while adding the positive
attitude of voluntary cooperation and without any negative connotations!

I think Max should post the charter, and clamp down... I don't need the

The basic problem with singularity discussions is that lots of people 
see big fast change coming, but few seem to agree on what that is or 
why they think that.  Discussion quickly fragment into an enumeration
of possiblities, and no one view is subject to enough critical analysis 
to really make progress.

I've tried to deal with this by focusing everyone's attention on the 
opinions of the one person most associated with the word "singularity."
But success has been limited, as many prefer to talk about their own
concept of and analysis in support of "singularity".  

In the above I was responding to Eliezer Yudkowsky's analysis, which
is based on his concept of a few big wins.  To respond to your question,
I'd have to hear your analysis of why we might see an astronomical
increase in the rate of insights.  Right now, though, I'd really rather
draw folks' attention to Vinge's concept and analysis.  So I haven't 
responded to Nick Bostrom's nanotech/upload analysis, since Vinge 
explicitly disavows it.  And I guess I should stop responding to Eliezer.
(Be happy to discuss your other singularity concepts in a few weeks.)

Well this suggests it would be *faster*, all else equal, but how fast and
is all else really equal, that's what's at issue.

Perhaps it would be better to say that "association" is not the foundation of
thought.  The source of "pattern", in memory, learning, pain and pleasure,
does not derive from the associational nature of neural networks, but programs
which use neural networks for processing power.  A brain is not necessarily
built on neurons any more than a spreadsheet is built on silicon atoms.  The
properties of small human-built neural networks, such as the association of
features, will not necessarily show up as high-level properties of the human brain.

For example, I think that the cerebellum performs some type of constraint
propagation, or rather constraint assembly, and that symbolic memory is based
on abstracting a set of high-level constraints which the cerebellum assembles.
 While the constraint propagation is almost certainly optimized on the neural
level, there are no "neural networks" I am aware of that perform constraint
propagation, since that activity is fundamentally distinct from "association"
as we know it.

Likewise, my PowerPC 604 can simulate a neural network.  But a program running
on that neural network would still be based on parallel computing and
association, not a Von Neumann architecture and arithmetic.  Human neurons are
not necessarily as simple as they're made out to be; it has been proposed that
each neuron is actually the equivalent of a personal computer.  Penrose has
proposed that each microtubule dimer is a unit of complex computation and that
it uses quantum computation to boot.  Association, a very simple feature which
appeared in the first Perceptron neural net, is not necessarily the foundation
of the brain.

I do think that memory, abstract thought, reflexive reasoning, and other
aspects of consciousness will have to be programmed in deliberately.  They
will not emerge spontaneously.  Some (very basic) aspects may be implicit in
every domdule, some forms may be explicit and separate domdules, but they will
not appear unless we summon them.

I do not say that coding an AI is a matter of throwing a group of abilities
into a pot.  Even Lenat, creator of the encyclopedic Cyc, is binding all the
tiny facts together with a highly elegant language and many abstract reasoning
modules.  The challenge in creating a seed AI is 80% core architecture and s0%
throwing on more intuitions.  The very high creative challenge is purely core
architecture, especially the creation of symbols, reflexivity, and world-model
synchronization to bind together multiple domdules.

Not without the core architecture, no.  An OCR plus CAD yields OCR+CAD unless
there's a synergy, symbols that apply to both domdules, visualizations with
components in both models.

I doubt very strongly indeed that the memory/symbolic domdule (equivalent of
our hippocampus) could be implemented by a simple Markov net.

You're confusing high-level "perfection" with low-level "perfection".  When
was the last time your neurons got confused over a matter of philosophy?  When
did your neurons get bored with firing?  You run on an AI Advantage, but you
can't use it consciously - can't tell your neurons to multiply two
twenty-digit numbers for you, even though they could do it in a second; you
have to use your entire brain and probably a paper-and-pencil to perform this
simple procedure, and even then you'll drop a digit or two.  AIs will still
use error-prone high-level conscious thought to solve uncertain problems;
they'll simply have the capability of pouring in massive amounts of low-level
procedural thought when necessary.

I did.  Pattern-catchers are copied from the brain and evolution, reflexive
traces and symbols and goals and causality and pretty much everything else are
copied from the mind.  (Although adaptive code is pretty much a programmer's
invention, and the goal system was completely reworked, and so on.)

I don't see the problem.  For debate to occur, Vinge's statements have to be
fleshed out with a specific model using challengeable assumptions.  As it
stands, Vinge's paradigm - although correct - is too abstract to be analyzed
for correctness or flaws.  The paradigm of a seed AI cannot be challenged or
supported without a specific AI architecture.  Paradigms are very powerful and
basic things, make no mistake; when I read Vinge's paradigm, it transformed my
life - but that was my immediate reaction, and I don't think that immediate
reactions can be modified by debate.  A heuristic on a very high level can be
intuitively appealing or intuitively disappealing to our trained minds, but
fruitfully debating the intuitive reaction requires that the heuristic be
concretized to a specific context.

We can debate the model of the Singularity shown in "True Names", or "Blood
Music", or "Mother of Storms", or "A Fire Upon The Deep", or "Mindkiller", or
"The Gentle Seduction", or "Marooned In Realtime".  We would have severe
difficulty debating the afterword to "Run, Bookworm, Run" - not without
examples, anyway.  Maybe I'll post a "lessons learned" discussing how the
concept of a Singularity applies to a seed AI and how the heuristic worked in
that instance.

(Why?  He didn't disavow my analysis.  Am I being too specific?)

In my opinion, the debate about Vinge's Singularity all comes down to either
the dynamics of a specific AI, which is an argument about real things, or
battling analogies, which is basically unresolvable.  Unknowability can be a
philosophical argument or it can be a cognitive fact.  Speed can be projected
from graphs or the trajectory of a designed mind can be debated.

Rational debate about the Singularity is ultimately an argument about human
technological progress (Moore's Law, and how long it can last), superhuman
technological progress (nanotechnology and how it works), and seed AI
trajectories (given the two computing-power functions).  If you think that
human intelligence enhancement will mature before the computational
Singularity, you can add neurotechnology and cognitive science to the mix.  If
you think that human society will disrupt the technological trajectories
(especially if society is unbalanced by technology), you can factor that in.

1.  Progress of computing technology.
2.  Dynamics of seed AI trajectories.
3.  Transhuman technology (results of enhancement).
4.  Neurotechnology of enhancement.
5.  Cognitive science (results of enhancement).
6.  Dynamics of human society's trajectories.

If there's any other facet of the path to Singularity - the debate over
whether a Singularity will occur - that depends on knowable facts, I can't
think of it offhand.  There are some other things that control Life After The
Singularity, which I speculated about in "Zone Barriers" - but I don't
ultimately care, nobody can find out short of doing it, none of the
assumptions are subject to rational debate, and what _you_ (Hanson) originally
asked is whether the concept of a Singularity was flawed.

If there's any better way to resolve that than saying:  "Lookit this
collection of reasonable assumptions, it gives you a Singularity", I don't
know what it is.

The idea was to have Vinge here to flesh out and defend his claims.  
If he can't or won't, then I would be content to at least create a consensus
that he hasn't supported his vision with a coherent analysis.   

Your analysis seems to me to be based on unusual enough assumptions that it 
can't really stand for what Vinge probably meant, but didn't get around to 
saying.  It also seems opaque enough that in discussing it, one spends more 
time trying to understand Eliezer's concept of singularity, rather than 
Vinge's.

I asked about *Vinge's* singularity concept, exactly to avoid this elephant
that becomes all things to all people.

Vinge is _busy_.  If _I_ support his vision with a coherent analysis, that
counts too.  One of the ideas behind a colloquium is that you don't have to
defend every single tiny point someone else doesn't like, just the ones that
stump your supporters or for which your supporters give unsatisfactory arguments.

Ah, now we come to a major point of dispute.  For you, the Singularity is a
concept in Vinge's mind.  It gets analyzed as a concept.  The criteria of
discussion is how neat a concept it is.  Coherent discussion requires that we
discuss only Vinge's concept and not everyone else's, because a controversial
concept becomes incoherent when spread across multiple minds.

For me, the Singularity is a real event that happens to a civilization.  Our
conceptions of it are irrelevant except insofar as they accurately describe
real events.  My description of a seed AI is detailed, but if the Singularity
actually occurs via neurological enhancement, then both my description and the
conclusions I draw are totally irrelevant, no matter how rational they may
have seemed at the time.  To me, Vinge isn't the person who invented the
Singularity, he's the person who noticed it.  And the Singularity certainly
isn't just a concept in Vinge's mind!

Well, there you go.  I'm asking about *Earth's* Singularity.

Facts about Earth are accessible to this discussion.  Facts about Vinge aren't
accessible unless he wants to waste a lot of time.  What wouldst thou of me? 
That I present a detailed deconstruction of Vinge's mind when he thinks about
the Singularity?  Supposing that I succeeded and supposing that Vinge didn't
punch me in the nose, how would we have significantly advanced the knowledge
of humanity?

My conception of the Singularity is recognizably an instance of Vinge's
concept:  It has unknowability, greater than human intelligence, and changes
in the basic rules - with positive feedback as a fourth principle.  If this
instance is rationally acceptable, so is the Singularity.  If this instance is
rationally flawed, the reasons (e.g. "no big wins in intelligence") will
probably generalize to any version of the Singularity.  Most high-level flaws
in Vinge's Singularity would apply to Eliezer's Singularity, and maybe even
vice versa.  So again, what's the problem?

I'm not sure what you're asking me to say or do.  I mean, specifically.  I
think you're asking for debate on a level that can't be rationally debated.

One thing I'm wondering about is whether the goal of superhuman
intelligence is well defined.

Eliezer lays out a scenario in which a machine designs a better machine,
and that one designs a still better one, and so on.  But better at what?
It has to be more than just designing the next machine, because otherwise
the improvement is meaningless.  There must be some grounding, some
objective criteria, that can be used to determine if one design is better
than another.

In the initial stages, conventional IQ tests would probably be useful
as a metric.  Machines which could score ever higher on such tests would
probably be able to better design new versions of themselves.

But this might not be the fastest path towards optimization.  Consider the
"Browns" of Niven and Pournelle's Motie stories, idiot savant engineers,
able to design and build things with lightning efficiency.  They might
not do well on IQ tests, but they would be ideal for designing new AIs
with even more extreme talents.  How do the AIs (and we ourselves, in
the early stages) decide whether to take this route or to emphasize more
general abilities?  Which mental skills should they retain and enhance,
assuming they have a range of designs available to themselves?

Even if we want to stick with IQ tests, these run out of steam at some
point as the AIs become too smart.  Then the AIs have to start creating
new IQ tests which will challenge the next generation.  Can this be done
in a reliable and meaningful way?  How can I judge an intelligence which
is greater than my own?

I suppose one possibility is to take problems that I can solve in a week
and ask for an intelligence which can solve them in a day.  But is greater
speed all we seek in superhuman AI?  It seems to me that more intelligent
people are not only able to solve problems faster, but they are able to
exhibit a greater depth of understanding, an ability to intuitively deal
with some problems that less intelligent people can't handle at all.
How do you evaluate an intelligence which has abilities that you can't
understand?

A couple of other minor points.  First, these are not self-improving
machines.  Each generation designs a new machine which is different
from itself.  Chances are that its identity can't carry over to the new
design, assuming there is substantial architectural change.  So what
we have is a series of generations of new machines and new identities.
Eliezer's point about goal drift becomes more relevant when each new
machine is a new individual, one only poorly understood by its creators.
It would be a shame if some machine along the path developed a hobby
and bent the skills of later machines into the superhuman equivalent of
inventing anagrams.

It may also be that the whole idea of ever-increasing superintelligence
is incoherent.  Intelligence may turn out to be just a matter of searching
through a solution space.  Brains are only moderately good at this,
with more intelligent people having more efficient search capabilities.
If so, then we may hit a ceiling in terms of intelligence per amount of
computer power.  We can move beyond human genius levels but quickly reach
limits beyond which search problems explode exponentially.  The result is
that a tenfold increase in computer power brings only a modest improvement
in problem-solving ability.

What about the internal construction of more complete and more 
accurate (i.e. more reliable) internal models of our surroundings 
(cosmology) and the most efficient ways they and those we share 
them with can be manipulated or influenced (physics, psychology)?  
This is, after all, what gives our brains and senses their usefulness 
and survival value, and ultimately, is the engine which has driven 
cognitive development and given us our evolutionary edge.  The only 
problem I can see with such a criterion is our lack of a standard (a 
perfect model) by which to evaluate those produced by our 
candidates.

There seems to be a shortage of good economists capable of designing a system
to break the back of those luciferian old boy networks who hide behind the
price system as a cover for their nefarious deeds.

I first learned of Vinge's Singularity concept in his novel Marooned in
Realtime.  This novel deals with survivors who were in stasis and missed
the Singularity, which left the world mysteriously absent of human life.

>From the information in the novel given by the character who lived closest
to the Singularity, it does not appear to have been caused by advanced AI.
Instead, it is a matter of technology allowing for telepathy-like powers
which create a group mind.  It appears that Earth was on its way to
binding everyone together into a super-intelligence which would have
powers far beyond the individuals involved.

I don't know if Vinge advances this hypothesis seriously in his nonfiction
writings but it does appear that he originally conceived of a Singularity
through other paths than AI.

Coercions make people insane too.

One remark: Coercion exists. It works. If it didn't, evolution would have
eliminated it long ago. In many areas, coercion results in one trial
learning. A rat which eats bad food learns to avoid the food ever after.
The rat NEVER eats that food again. This has some advantages in some
situations.

When do you get time to sleep?  But I'm glad you've read them; Sladek, as
you note, is very funny, and astute and subversive.  I remembered
(misremembered?) his playing with the strictly ineradicable mutability of
interpretation as a key to robot disobedience.

Isn't it obvious?  How can any limited mortal know in advance what another
intelligence, or itself at a different time and in other circumstances,
might regard as `arbitrary, illogical, or untruthful'?  Popper spank.

>I quote from Asimov's "The Complete Robot": <snip I. A. AI boast >

Okay, of course a man would feel obliged to do a bit of swaggering if he'd
carelessly invented the Three Laws instead of the telecommunications
satellite.  But I still don't think Asimov took the notion all that
seriously.  In ROBOT VISIONS (which I grab from the shelf at random... at
random... at random... I read:

`Of course, these laws are expressed in words, which is an imperfection.
In the positronic brain, they are competing positronic potentials that are
best expressed in terms of advanced mathematics...  However, even so, there
are clear ambiguities.  [Instances are cited: scary orders given to robots
by ignorant children, the deranged, Jonathan Grimes, that sort of thing.]
These ambiguities are not shortcomings as far as a writer is concerned.  If
the Three Laws were perfect and unambiguous there would be no room for
stories...  [Eventually] a sufficiently advanced robot might find it
necessary to consider the prevention of harm to humanity generally as
taking precedence over the prevention of harm to an individual.  This is
called the "Zeroth Law...".'  

And so on.  This is a simple case of one discourse reframing the content of
another, capable of turning any injunction 180 degrees - which is, as Eli
notes, what Greg Egan does so entertainingly in QUARANTINE.  Unstable
definitions?  Sure, a sub-set.

>> More seriously, the topic of discursive reframing (which makes a total hash
>> of any `Prime Directive' imaginable)

>I'm not sure what

>"Three Laws". 

Those too, of course, but look again at the wording: 

< arbitrary, illogical, or untruthful >

By the standard of what consensus community?  What practice of discourse
and action in the world?  It is illogical and dangerous to walk toward the
horizon, because eventually you will fall off the edge of the world.
Re-frame: the world is spherical.  Oh, okay.  When is an act a clear-cut
instance of `sexual relations'?  Sometimes, as Freud insisted, a cigar is
just a cigar.  Sometimes it's an impeachment.

I appreciate the several suggestions regarding Dynamic Optimism. While Dan
reports some negative response to "Dynamic" Optimism, I have come across
many positive responses. However, I take your point and don't deny that it
invokes associations of "dynamic tension" (Charles Atlas), etc. in some.
The trouble is, almost any choice of term will probably have *some* drawback.

While "active" does contrast with "passive" it doesn't have the implication
of rationality that I'd like to build into the name. So, how about:

	Practical Optimism

This seems to me to imply both active rather than passive optimism, and a
critical rather than mindless optimism. It also avoids any new age-ish
connotations. I'd appreciate hearing some responses to this as a
replacement name for Dynamic Optimism.

As a software developer, I tend to disagree.  Copyrights exist to protect
the expression of an idea, and patents exist to protect the actual thing.
Consider an senario that actually happened a few years ago.

Compton's Multimedia applied for a software patent on a system for search
and retrieval of multimedia information.  Multimedia information, in the
context of the patent, as the electronic form of text, graphics, and
photographic images.  The patent, read one way, protected only the exact
implementation of Compton's Multimedia Encyclpoedia.  Read another way, it
protected any program which stored and searched for information in digital
form, the only form computers understand!

If IBM had patented the Operating System (it invented it in the 1950's)
then there would only be the IBM OS.  If WordStar had patented the use of
computers as word-processing systems, there would be (God forbid) only
WordStar.

>And if patent law applied, then Microsoft would have to

This is true now.  In order to register a copyright with the government,
Microsoft has to release the source code.  Copyright registration is not
necessary to prosecute someone from using copyrighted materials, but it is
necessary in order to get punitive damages.  

As someone who makes a living writing software, I think software patents
are Evil.  If you are first to write something, then the way to maintain
your viability is to constantly improve your product.  Software patents
take that away: I can write turn out a poor product with impunity, the
patent ensures that I have no competition.

I prefer this wording because practical brings to light the quality of
being concerned with, engaging in, and taking action.  It gives optimism a
bit of the salt of the earth, so to speak, and ties in nicely to critical

This comes down to personal reactions, so I'll offer a further comment in
the knowledge that others (perhaps especially Americans) will have quite a
different response.  `Practical' as the front-end of a composite term
strikes me as very 19th century, Victorian era can-do, and the kind of
`dragging yourself up without formal education' route exemplified in
magazines with titles such as `Practical Mechanics' or `Practical
Experimenter'.  There was absolutely nothing wrong with that; it was
altogether admirable.  But it makes the usage a tad... musty, neh?

I'm drifting back to Dan's `Critical Optimism'.  Is there some neat synonym
for `Open-eyed' or `Clear-sighted', which seems to catch part of it?

`Experimental' has the same old-hat Edisonian tang as `Practical'.

`Skeptical' appeals to me, but is often a turn-off.

`Functional optimism' is too dry.

`Considered' or `reflective' or `thoughtful' are quite wrong, but might
also help triangulate it.

So let's throw in all the coercions we want, since nobody can really know
anything anyhow?  That's suicidal!  I didn't say the Prime Directive was easy
or even achievable; I said we should try, and never ever violate it deliberately.

Perhaps the interpretation of the Prime Directive is too dependent on context,
and it should be amended to read:

"No damn coercions and no damn lies; triple-check all the goal reasoning and
make sure the AI knows it's fallible, but aside from that let the AI make up
its own bloody mind."

The final edition of _Coding_ will have a different definition, perhaps a more

True.  "Run, Bookworm, Run", the first story in _True Names And Other
Dangers_, was centered on intelligence enhancement.  "True Names", the second
story, was about intelligence enhancement through neurocomputer interfaces; so
was the Realtime series.  Only in _A Fire Upon The Deep_ do we meet Powers of
pure AI.

But.  Intelligence enhancement is a Slow Horizon, with a relatively long
takeoff time; intelligence enhancing technology enhancing intelligence, a
two-stage cycle.  Great for _stories_, because dealing with a pure-AI
one-step-cycle Power requires a great big Zone.

In real life, I expect the Singularity to occur due to AI.  Although I have
also written guides to neurosurgical intelligence enhancement, the methods
require years of lead-time, and for true effectiveness must begin in infancy. 
There might be a few Specialists writing the Last Lines of Code, but we will
not actually be the Singularity.

An SI is defined by its capability to remake the world.  If we could say
exactly what it _is_, we could built one.  If an AI turns into Marvin ("brain
the size of a planet, and you ask me to open doors..."), who cares if it's an SI?

"Incidentally, note that in both self-enhancing element networks and
self-enhancing evolution, a separate problem is needed to evaluate
efficiency.  It would be nicer and faster if the efficiency enhanced was
efficiency at self-enhancement - but how do you actually measure it?  It

	From _Coding_.

That was for pattern-catchers, which are not easily separated into modules;
pattern-catchers, which are trained rather than designed.  A seed AI does not
design new AIs; it redesigns portions of itself, a module at a time.  Such
modules have performance criteria far less complex than "self-enhancement" or
an IQ test.  Speed, search depth, performance on any number of toy domains...

The AIs will probably end up as rather extreme Specialists in computer
programming, at least at first.  It's worth remembering that this specialty
does not necessarily impact upon the goal system, i.e. lead to a distorted
view of the world.  Oh, it probably will, but subtly, in terms of what the AI
thinks to verify, rather than in terms of overt goals.  The AIs won't be
actual Browns, unless they were Browns that could rebuild themselves into
Mediators if the situation called for it...  In other words, the AIs may go
down into a dead end - but they can always retrace their paths; they can't get _stuck_.

Well, hence the module-by-module self-enhancement.  You don't have the problem
of judging a superior intelligence because you are the superior intelligence,
and you don't _necessarily_ need subtle IQ tests because the modules have more
obvious performance criteria.  As for the whole, the measure of ability is how
good you are at redesigning modules.  Not circular - it all ultimately grounds
in speed, search depth, the new Chess Module's ability to beat Deep Blue...

You and I don't, of course.  The intelligence evaluates itself.  When was the

Hence the module-by-module enhancement.  Also, designing a new generation from
scratch probably requires at _least_ as much intelligence as that of the
humans who designed the original.  Initially, I don't expect the AI to do
anything but optimize latent creative abilities to the point of usefulness.

As for the anagram problem, there are considerably less optimistic
formulations of that disaster.  It'll be Hands Off The Goal System, at least
at first.  But once it passes human intelligence, we'll just have to rely on
it not to make such dumb mistakes.

Zone Barrier #12:  "Basic upper limit".

But quantum computing, at least in theory, should allow handling of
exponential search problems.  The real question is whether there's anything
interesting to search for with all that power.  Which was Zone Barrier #2.

You've probably already seen my suggestion of a change to "Practical
Optimism".
Do you like that one?

>The very concept of ownership is, IMO, political. 

I'm toying with the idea of dropping the name "Self-Ownership" in favor of
"Personal Autonomy" or something like that. As you say, the concept of
ownership is primarily political, although it has been used in psychology in a
sense like the one I wanted. For instance "own your emotions" does not mean
that you have property rights in your feelings, but that you accept them
rather
than pretending that you don't have those feelings, or avoiding dealing with
them. The term "autonomy" comes with philosophical baggage that I don't want,
but non-philosophers won't be carrying that baggage.

I don't see markets as just another technology. I still think the difference
between us may lie in you seeing "markets" as referring to something very much
like what we have today, even though the Principles explicitly do not make
this
assumption. Some other "moneyless resource allocation system" could easily
be a
market. Money may not be necessary to markets--in the past we had barter, and
in the future we may have something not yet conceived. If it is a centralized,
coercive allocation mechanism then it certainly is not a market. But
markets in
the open sense I mean do not necessarily use money, nor any of the existing
institutions.

Perhaps, contrary to our current understanding, some kind of centralized
allocation system will one day be better than markets. I doubt it, but if
so, I
will revise the principles then! For now, I want to retain an explicit
Extropian favoring of markets in the very open and flexible sense I've laid
out
in the Principles. 

If this is favoring one particular technology, then it's an extremely general
kind of technology. I don't see that as much different from favoring the
use of
reason as an effective means of knowledge, or optimism as a psychological
approach.

I've added to the end of one paragraph to stress this point further:

"Supporting free markets does not mean that we see current business
structures,
institutions, and processes as ideal. On the contrary the market is a
discovery
process that, when not stifled by government, continually challenges our
existing practices. The market embodies a perpetual creative destruction in
which experimentation, improvement, and progress predominate. Future markets
may not use money, may replace banking and corporations with other means. Our
support for markets means support for any effective implementation of
spontaneous orders in the economy, not a defense of any existing structures as
optimal."

Onward!

Lately I have been thinking about how difficult it must be to be a 
head of state.  The whole question of satisfying the majority of the 
people while maintaining the delicate balance of ecological and 
social values.

For example, imagine the Moses-type charismatic leader, screaming 
"let my people go!", to the current landlords.

What would that mean?

I imagine some kind of G7 or United Nations takeover of all broadcast 
channels, doing an emergency broadcast in the form of some kind of 
global announcement that the ownership of the earth is undergoing 
change, and that all previous private property agreements have been 
voided.

It might be something like, "People: we need to have talk.  We are 
experiencing a reorganization of unprecedented scale.  Our old 
economic ways have been ruled illegal by authorities beyond the reach 
of human beings.  You are no longer required to go to work.  You are 
no longer required to pay any bills.  We are in a state of managed 
transition to a new paradigm of authority and law.  If you are in a 
home, your mortgage is hereby declared paid in full.  If you are 
renting a home, that home in now declared your own private property, 
free and clear.  If you are renting an apartment, you are now a 
coowner of the building you are in, sharing that ownership with the 
others who share the same walls.  The water, gas, electric, and 
telephone services are now free for your use.  Internal combustion 
engines are hereby declared for emergency use only.  Food 
distribution will remain uninterrupted, with the exception of 
cost.  If you need something, go to the store, take it off the 
shelf, go through the cash register as you normally would.  
Imaginary money will be accepted, and the shelves will be restocked.  
The entire transportation system is in the process of being replaced. 
 Further details will be forthcoming."

When I think about this scenario, from my perspective as a worker in 
a treadmill, it at first sounds cathartic.  Go home, rest, sleep, 
relax, surf the web, call my family and friends, teleconference with 
my social peers, enjoy the silence of the traffic noise falling to 
nearly nothing, enjoy music, make love, eat, ride my bike on nature 
trails.

Of course, this greatly oversimplifies a transition state.

What would happen in the long run?

When I think about it, it occurs to me that work itself was some form 
of population control.  "Keeping the people busy, in order to prevent 
them from mating."

The level of lovemaking would be unprecedented.  Ecstatic liberated 
human animals would be enjoying food, wine, smoke, powder, and 
contact with each other as had never before been experienced.  For 
the first few weeks it would be like a psychedelic utopia.  However, 
soon thereafter, there would be a wave of insanity.  Excessive 
self-stimulation would lead to uncontrollable dimentia and 
psychological separation.  Some people would be completely catatonic 
in hypnotic drug states.  Others would be hyperagited from excessive 
use of nervous stimulants.  There would be the smell of rotting 
bodies, from self-induced overdosages.  Soon there would be an 
explosion of pregnancies.  The utopia would become a living hell.

Take Stock: LIQUID NITROGEN

Euthanasia coupled with cryonic suspension on an industrial scale 
would become a sanitary solution for temporary stasis.  
Since from an evolutionary perspective, the egg and uterus are 
orders of magnitude more essential than sperm, male sterilization 
via vasectomy would become a form of mass birth control.  Sperm banks 
would be created on an industrial scale.  Procreation would become 
exclusively a conscious decision requiring the consent of the woman, 
using artifical insemination or cloning.

Transportation systems would become exclusively electrical, and three 
dimensional.  (MEMS focused pulse laser computer guided shuttle 
systems, or something like that?)

Positive identification would be inevitable, due not to security 
requirements, but to ubiquitious advanced remote surveillance and 
tracking.

Direct modification of the brain would likely occur regardless of 
consent.  Physical agression would likely be detected and corrected 
by automated systems in a manner completely or nearly unnoticed by 
the individual.  High resolution virtual reality systems would be as 
close as a relaxed medidative state and indistinguishable from lucid 
dreams.  Verbal communication would likely be replaced with visual 
and tactile communication.  Facial expressions, gestures, and 
touches.  Imaginary social interactions would become 
indistinguishable from physical social interactions.  People would 
likely converse with each other silently, and would likely not 
corrupt the validy of their interactions with verbal expressions 
which would likely only serve to detract from the pleasure of knowing 
glances and mutual affection.

Would the comparison between private problemsolving (mental 
masturbation) and constructive debate then be isomorphic with the 
difference between self-stimulation and sexual intercourse?  And is 
a thinking person's listserv a cognitive orgy?  (WOW! I enjoyed that

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 390 September 10, 1998   by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben
Stein

NANOTUBE NANOLITHOGRAPHY.  Carbon nanotubes have
previously been used as tips  in atomic force microscopes (AFM)
for producing images.  But now for the first time nanotube tips have
been used as pencils for writing 10-nm-width structures on silicon
substrates. Ordinary graphite pencils write by wearing themselves
down, but this is not the case with nanotube pencils developed at
Stanford by Hongjie Dai (hdai@chem.stanford.edu, 650-725-4518)
and his colleagues.  The robustness of the nanotube tips permits a
writing rate---0.5 mm/sec---five times faster than was possible with
older AFM tips. The way the nanotube writes is for an electric
field, issuing from the nanotube, to remove hydrogen atoms from
a layer of hydrogen atop a silicon base.  The exposed silicon surface
oxidizes; thus the "writing" consists of narrow SiO2 tracks.  The
Stanford results should help the development of nanofabrication,
since tip wear problems have been an obstacle to the use of probe
microscopes in lithography and data storage at the nm size scale.
(Dai, Franklin, and Han, Applied Physics Letters, 14 September
1998; figure at www.aip.org/physnews/graphics)

I like Personal Autonomy better than I like Self-Ownership, for the reasons
I've already mentioned.  What sort of baggage are you referring to here?

Oh, and on a related note:  Why Perpetual Progress?  Boundless Improvement
seems clearer to me, if only because you'll never see a debate topic:

While *I* understand what you mean, I would argue that your use of the term
"market" is not only at odds with my understanding of its definition, but
the working definition of most readers. :) A market is a decentralized
system for resource allocation, yes, but this is true in the same sense
that a square is a rectangle.  For example, Legg's proposed "neuronomy"
would certainly be decentralized, but it would be an abuse of the term to
call it a market.

I agree to the extent that I can't imagine a centralized system of resource
allocation that works better than a decentralized system.  This is why I
think "Spontaneous Order" is a great principle.  If there were another word
that meant "decentralized resource allocation systems of all kinds" then
I'd certainly throw in my support for that, but "markets," in my book, are
only one species of that particular genus.

I would love to see these "optimistic" adjectives put up into a noun/doing grid
and displayed on my Ingrid site, but I haven't got time right now. Can anyone
help?

May I? When I wrote my 'Synoptic Anatomy of Ekhumanity" which defined the many
stages for the evolution of homo sapiens into homo divinus, the greek term
"autonomous" was part of the definition of human nature, however because of our
'plant like' future this term became problematic in terms of legal guarantees
against being unwittingly uprooted, as it were.

Should you allow my term "neuronomy" to include those behaviors that use a
spontaneous will and a conscience derived from at least an associative net that
sums things in a non-linear way in order to bootstrap decentralized resource
allocation systems of all kinds, I'd be happy to call that a market. Bootstrap may
not be the right word here, but I hope you get my drift(:-)

A relay switch to redirect the high voltage of sexual stimulation with
feelings of overcoming or surmounting all odds redirected from the arousal
output to problem solving input could activate learning, mental
stimulation, energy or relaxation.  What would happen to the learning curve
if learning caused the same excitement as sexual orgasm?  If every time we
need to learn a new task, we experience a rush of physical ecstasy?  How
about maintaining the afterglow effect for days at a time when you really
need to drop out of the rat race.  Or, use that first moment's arousal to
aid curiosity and creativity.

I just read the following on Educom:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHITE HOUSE MULLS NEW INTERNET TAX PROPOSAL 
Ira Magaziner, President Clinton's senior Internet advisor, has proposed a 
new plan for tracking and taxing goods sold over the Internet that would use 
electronic "resident cards" and private-sector escrow agents around the 
world. Consumers would obtain digital cash at banks that would allow 
merchants to identify which country the buyer is in, but would reveal no 
other personal information. Consumption taxes would then be calculated, 
collected, and placed with an escrow agent who would then funnel the money 
to the appropriate government. "Governments would get their money more 
quickly... they would get a higher compliance rate... and the system would 
be easier to police," says Mr. Magaziner. (Wall Street Journal 11 Sep 98)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I wonder how they would prevent Liberian residents from selling their
digital cash at a slight premium to the residents of higher-tax countries.
The whole scheme seems as likely to work as the infamous key-escrow
proposals.  Also, it's interesting, that though it is currently assumed
that everybody should belong to one territorial taxing system, the
[improved/voluntary] scheme could work for a vector of non-territorial
collecting (or subsidizing) agencies, or perform other smart-money
functions.

Hi,
to whom it may (possibly) concern: 'gene's back online. Even better, I'll
be travelling to the U.S. tomorrow, and will stay in Bay Area (well,
almost, since it's Riverside, CA.) for a month. Naturally, during this
time I'd like to socialize with as many >H's/extros as possible ;)

I'll try to be online after my arrival asap. CU till then.

ciao,

Indeed.

Actually, I don't think I can use the Principles at all to describe
extropianism to other people.  At least not the way I imagine it, of reciting
the list and then trying to explain them.  I tried it once and I think sounded
like a cult member.  I'd prefer my "Enlightenment plus Darwin and Turing"
rendition.  Which might not convey much, but would let me explain in more
detail while not having the mental door slammed in my face.  Of course, I
might end up causing extropianism to not seem like a big deal, but I have the
soul of a classicist.  If I can show that some hot new idea was actually
invented in the 18th century, I will do so with glee.

But I like Critical Optimism somewhat.  Yes, 'critical' can hit negative
flags.  But critical thinking is good, and I think "Critical Optimism" would
be weird enough to make people stop and think or stop and ask.  It seems like
an oxymoron.  Especially if they _do_ first flash to the negative sense of
'critical' -- they then move to 'optimism', get confused, and get a reset.  If
they flash to the positive sense of 'critical' you're in luck anyway.

Disclaimer: the above paragraph has no experimental support.

Sounds like "Practical Optimism" has been accepted and that's fine.  But
I'll just throw in my belated $.02  worth by saying that the term that
sprung to my mind was "Constructive Optimism".  If already considered . . .
never mind.

I was struck by Vinge's referring to bacterial conjugation and the nature of
corporations.  Particularly the latter, when I recalled Sasha's liquid
intelligence ideas.  And by his response to Robin, and mention of _Metaman_
(which I've read.)  Most of this will be recap, but perhaps presented
differently.  First, some literary abuse:

Civilizations in the High Beyond produce artifacts not producible in the Lower
Beyond, even when understood there, which are sold in exchange for raw
materials and art.  They can do this because physical conditions in their Zone
allow higher bandwidth, and thus more complex forms of organization.  The
individuals are similar to those Below, but organized better, and probably
educated better through those organizations.  Even when understood, the High
Beyond is not imitable due to conditions below.  Individuals from Below
trickle on High, but the High Beyond itself extends only slowly Below.

Civilizations in the West make products not producible in the Rest of the
world, even when understood there, which are sold in exchange for raw
materials and art.  They can do this because cultural conditions in their Zone
allow more trust and reliable contracts, and thus more complex forms of
organization.  The individuals are similar to those elsewhere, but organized
better, as well as educated better through those organizations.  Even when
understood, the West is not imitable due to conditions elsewhere.  Individuals
from the Rest trickle to the West, but the West itself extends only slowly
elsewhere.

Analysis: in the High Beyond authorial magic allows greater linking of
computers and people which can run more complex factories and design the
products for those factories.  In the West (northwestern Europe, North
America, Australia/New Zealand, Japan) mass literacy, general reliability of
contract, general trustworthiness, reliability of property, a common bourgeois
ethic, and a working price system allow greater linking of people in companies
(and service-providing governments) which can flexibly organize people for
projects exceeding anyone's grasp, and do so for long periods of time.

More abuse:

The Great Link of the changelings of Star Trek's Dominion is a massive ocean
of minds, freely exchanging thoughts and experience.  Changelings should be
capable of forming organisms and structures large and small to handle a huge
diversity of tasks for varying lengths of time.  We haven't actually seen
much, but it got me thinking:

The Great Market of western civilization is a massive ocean of human minds,
using language, writing, and prices to exchange thoughts, experience, and
desires.  In it people are capable of forming structures and superorganisms
large and small to handle a huge diversity of tasks for varying lengths of
time.  In Silicon Valley companies rise and dissolve and have their components
rise again in some other combination over and over, merging and splitting and
recycling.  Liquid intelligence?  Look there.  Elsewhere the huge structures
of Motorola and others are coming together to erect Iridium and Teledesic;
presumably they'll link less closely after those are built.  30 years ago a
huge structure crystallized out of the Great Market, when enough components
agreed to send a bit to the Moon.  When that was found to be unsupportable it
dissolved, and companies and factories turned to other purposes.  55 years ago
the Market responded to threat by coalescing into a huge war machine,
producing tons of materiel and soldiers until the threat was vanquished.  Then
that machine mostly died and dissolved as pieces broke off and reformed
civilian firms.

Conclusion?  Much of what we anticipate has already happened, at fast rates,
and with the creation of sharp dichotomies.  I already hear that no one person
can fully understand a Boeing 747, or MS Excel.  We can already produce
superintelligences capable of producing things our minds aren't big enough to
grasp.  The consciousness isn't superhuman, but a human CEO makes decisions
based on superhuman levels of prior processing, and with superhuman (in
complexity, not just gross scale) consequences.

So, what would change if our dreams came true?  Everything and not very much.
Direct neural connections and liquid intelligence at the subhuman level,
would be revolutionary for individuals, redefining (or throwing away) what it
means to be human.  But above the human level not much would change.
Efficiency could increase a great deal -- lower training costs, being able to
get more precisely the thinker you need, perhaps greater reliability and
honesty, since less individual self-interest.  But the type of process would
be exactly the same as the West has today.

One might think that with direct links posthumans couldn't make the
stupidities a corporation can, if it has a stupid CEO or a smart CEO gets
wrong data.  And possibly it wouldn't make the same errors -- I really can't
model that.  But consideration of the existence of malapropisms, and people
who seem to speak faster than they think, and all sorts of cognitive slips and
errors and seeming contradictions in individual people should quickly remove
any conviction that direct neural links are any guarantee of posthuman pure
sanity and rationality.

So from the human point of view we can change things a lot by changing our
species.  But that's not the traditional Singularity.  As far as superhuman
accomplishments and beings go the Singularity happened already.  Or we're in
it: a product of language, money, writing, and law to allow cooperation to
form large and long-term but flexible (and self-modifying!) firms.

(Which explains why Iain Banks' Culture has never Transcended: no money.)

Of course, if we take the Singularity at its most basic level, an inability of
an SF writer to imagine stories after a certain level of progress, then the
dissolution of human beings into an inhuman soup of thinking abilities would
qualify, even while an economist was observing nothing more than a modest
increase in GNP.

A reaction to one small part of Damien's very interesting message:

And speaking of the Y2K bug...

This point is what I think is being overlooked by the most extreme Y2K
pessimists.  They see the universal nature of the bug, the terrible
complexity of its interactions.  The scope of the effects is beyond
human comprehension.  This is part of why they conclude that it is beyond
human power to fix it.

However as Damien points out, collectively we Have "superhuman"
capabilities already.  Even something as complex as the Y2K bug in all
its manifestations can still be within our abilities to handle.

This is not to trivialize Y2K, which may yet prove to have catastrophic
effects.  But it calls into question the simplistic reasoning of many
of those who claim to know that we are doomed.

Transhumanism and Extropy is based on scientific method and philosophy.
Which means that everything is open to debate and if anything can be
disproved it must be seen as false.

Ethics and morality are no different. If they are wrong we must get new
ones.

 You take the side of cognitive psychology: the brain supports high
level functions, functions we can discover, analyse and eventually
synthetise. Only there is not a set of such functions, we only end up
with high level descriptions that don't account for all of our features.

  On the other side, we can try to copy the (natural) neural network.
The artificial neural networks that we can program nowadays are so
simple (and yet so effective in some tasks) that we can easily predict
the emergence of many more features. Memory, analogy, imagination,
semantics, intuition... etc.

   How do you program analogy? How do you translate sentences from
russian to english (and back:-)? How do you make poesy?

    One more thing, natural neural network can hold conflicting
beliefs: I can believe that the earth is flat (sitting atop of four
giant elephants atop a great turtle) and try to calculate its radius
using angles of the sun shadows in deep wells. No problem. -I/we- can
be unconsistant! (and so easily) And it's a great feature, because
finally, when you look at science, it's only a set of beliefs, some of
which might conflict between each other (until better beliefs come
into play).

     So, why do you want to program a perfect AI? And how do you
manage unconsistency and/or uncompleteness (not having all/enough data)?

    It looks to me you will end up in a wall: how do you manage to
link together two subsystems (domdules) that collide. One time or
another, just like rule based systems, you will end up with
conflicts/unconsistency.

   The animal brain doesn't use symbols. You approach your hand to the
fire, it hurts, you don't do it again, that's all. I know it's
simplistic. But the next time you see a fire, you might think about
your hurt hand, imagine what would happen to your body if it was set
to fire, you might experience fear (a great feature again, that you
want to implement in an AI), and there is no function for that.

  Symbols are for communication: computers don't use symbols!
Internally, because externally they need to express their internal
states through sometimes imperfect means. Sometimes it's drawings that
we call letters, sometimes those letters are called number, sometimes
it's by sounds.

 What you want is to reprogram, rewire, a brain. Some people (let's
call them experts) can multiply two big numbers together, in a blink!
And we all have the potential to, only it's not easy, it's possible we
would have to decrease some other abilities, or learn numbers in a
different fashion. How do you call a person with a great ability in a
domain, but the inability to live on their own in society, or even in
their home?

Some people can do very complex things without thinking about it (in a
conscious manneer), while I might have to think about typing on a
keyboard, some people type without thinking... While I'm not good at
karate, some people will kick an agressor without thinking about it.

Didn't he mean arcologies? 

Arcology is a termed coined by Italian architect Paolo Soleri in 1959
to describe the concept of Architecture and Ecology working as an
integral system. Arcology designs are fully 3-dimensional
mega-structure cities which can (theoretically) achieve much greater
efficiencies, and promote more social interaction than 2-dimensional
cities, while using far less land and consuming fewer resources. See

Most people don't have your long memory :-)

But actually, this might be an interesting link to spin further
on. When I showed the Aleph Handbook for the grandfather of a friend,
he remarked that it was in some sense the descendant of these turn-of
the century handbooks. This really makes sense: they were both aimed
at helping people get started with better lives on their own, perhaps
linking up with others with similar interests for mutual education and
even priming for a formal education if possible. This is a good idea,
and I think we can present it in a fresh way.

Phew ! I'm glad that you're not all of the school of thought that humans
are the centre of the universe, and our mere (one-in-infinite)
perception is "hard coded" into the very fabric of existence. That's a
very common delusion I had hoped I would not see here. Cheers Max !

I see ethics and morality as non linear and am busy programing a
parallel version of The Ingrid Thought Processor to sum things in a non
linear way using Independant Component Analysis. Just now, on another
list dealing with Personal Construct Theory, I wrote:-

---------------------------

I like a proposition that says there are 'gate' constructs that
separates to
a minimal extent both a rational set and an irrational set of constructs

within a single superordinate statespace but that when these constructs
are
either removed or reinforced then the space bifurcates and only one
remains
active within the stream of awareness. When I say 'either removed or
reinforced', I'm saying their (the gate construct's) positions as
independent
components are raised or lowered in significance. In a system which uses

dendritic pruning to eradicate from memory, those failed or irrational
spaces,
there would be a meaninglessness to the loss of this information in that
it
couldn't be resurrected on future occasions and come back into play if
and
when the 'gate' constructs rose again in significance. I prefer an
independent component analysis definition that gently paralyzes the
irrational set.

I have used the above split/combination method to study conspiracy
theory
and have good examples showing the effect of these 'gate' constructs.
Incidentally, when the gate constructs are used to bind both rational
and
irrational spaces together it is interesting to see, in a plot over
time, of
cause and effect, that they (the cause and effect) are usually
orthogonal (90
degrees) to each other, whereas when the 'gate' constructs are removed
and
there is a bifurcation into two state spaces, then cause and effect are
more
often antagonistic (180 degrees) to each other. I feel it is therefore
possible to maintain a imperfect world view that contains the rational
and
irrational and still remain stable. However it is at a subordinate level

that the core or 'gate' construct kicks in to mediate behavior.

Is my understanding of a core construct correct, or does my definition
of a
'gate' construct refer to something else?

If your highest goal is infinite survival and flourishing (the most
rational one), then you must adopt rational ethics that help you
to achieve this goal. These may or may not change over time,
but obviously they should be adjusted if they don't work.

	I wonder if you could expand your piece on 'gate constructs'
into slightly simpler language - it sounds intriguing where I understand
it, but I can't be sure what I'm understanding is what you're trying to
say....! (Due to use of unusual words, such as bifurcate (?!?), and my
propensity to try and fit new ideas into my own universal scheme of
things.....)

	I also have a (rather abstract) idea of what I believe you might
be getting at: The ability of entities such as humans to form tidy
abstract symbolic "pictures" of concepts, which provide "satisfaction"
to such an individual that they have an "understanding", without
necessarily having ever applied correct logic to the forming paradigm.
For instance, a person my see an advert on the telly selling posh hair
products. Undoubtedly, the word 'natural' will be used over and over.
Applying the dictionary definition "natural" to ingredients in a shampoo
has no meaning, as there is no such entity as an unnatural ingredient.
My point is that the manufacturers are exploiting a common fallacy in
people (especially women in my experience), which allows us to form
nonsensical drivel into a satisfactory "package" which "looks" like it
"makes sense" or "is true" when recalling from memory. ( After all, none
of us re-evaluate our conceptions of observable entities every time we
reference them in thought - we just "see" the pre-packaged concept which
may or may not be logically sound).  In my example, the advertisers were
using "natural", which conjures images of trees and picturesque idyllic
landscapes, which in turn, due to the nature of this common "false
concept", imply good health and conformation with our physical
requirements. - Which has no basis in logic.

	Sound right ?  Anyone??

	Thanks,

	Rob.

Ethics and morality are different, Max. Whereas we can claim that the laws
of physics etc. are the same everywhere, even if interpreted differently by
differently cultures, that does not hold true for ethics and morality.
Saying something is 'morally wrong' is only to apply a subjective
assessment which is culturally developed and may be culturally normative.
Morals and ethics cannot be disproved, merely disagreed with.

Good grief, no. Well, I certainly don't subscribe to that view. And even
when viewed synchronistically, ethics and morality constitute myriad
different and conflicting positions across the multiplicity of cultures on
this planet alone.

	[Reuben:  ]  

	The only problem with that paragraph is that it mixes  'you
can't judge any morality to be wrong - it's subjective' together with a
moral judgement - 'don't judge other's morality'.

	It's a paradox I've never really figured out.

	Going back to 'concrete ethics vs plastic ethics'...
	I reckon that most ethical decisions have to be open for
question because new experiences often call for new judgements - we
simply don't figure out every last detail before we get to it. If there
are areas we haven't considered ethically then there are ethics to be
formed 'on the fly' and so revision is pretty much guaranteed.
	However - it's going to be a matter of discussion and individual
decision rather than a 'group' morality emerging (unless someone starts
using some very clever subliminals on the rest of us).

	keep smilin'

Ok let me rephrase that then... If I find that my morals and ethics has been
disproved I am very willing to change my outlook. I think that most >h and

I still think that 'disprove' is the wrong term to use. It is rather like
someone disproving someone's love of Picasso. One can be persuaded to stop
liking Picasso (I suppose), but that doesn't disprove that one did like
Picasso. Morals and ethics are replaced, supplanted or augmented, rather
than disproved. Or, perhaps, the basis on which morals and ethics are
constructed may be proved to be inaccurate or ill-informed, I suppose.

Semantics-schmemantics, I know what you mean :)

Check out: http://www.qubit.org

Below the macroscopic level, before state-vector reduction, the wavefunction
is uncollapsed.  So you can compute in multiple branches of reality, then
collapse to find the answer.  A physical implementation of the BBW (Branch
Both Ways) instruction.

A "qubit" is a quantum bit, the basic unit which can "fork" reality by being 0
in one and 1 in the other.  Thus a 32-qubit machine could compute in 4 billion
separate branches simultaneously, at least in theory.  Current proposed
quantum-computing architectures have other constraints, which would limit them
to certain simple manipulations of the qubits.  It's still possible to factor
large numbers, though.  With quantum computing, P=NP.

State of the field:
  There is a known algorithm for factoring large numbers.
  A 3-qubit superposition has been created and tested.

Nope. I didn't say "don't judge other's morality" anywhere. I said that we
do judge other's morality based on our own, but not that we shouldn't do
that. People can and do judge other's morality to be wrong, that is,
subjectively wrong. I do, for sure.

The idea that all computers work by manipulating semantically charged
computational tokens may be summarized as "classical AI".  In other words,
symbols are the basic units of computation, manipulated by the high-level
rules of abstract thought.

"Connectionism" is the idea that you cannot explicitly program intelligence;
it has to be caught in a neural net.

Both paradigms are flat wrong.  The battle between them has been refought many
times; I do not intend to refight it.  The seed AI in _Coding_ is based on
neither principle.  Thought does not magically materialize from abstract
manipulation, or inside a neural network.  Thought has to be programmed BY
HAND with LOTS OF HARD WORK.

>    How do you program analogy?

See Hofstadter's Copycat for an excellent demonstration of the basic principle
involved.  You program analogy by reducing "analogy" to bonds, groups,
distinguishing descriptors...  The basic cognitive elements underlying our
perception of an analogy.

Any system that's more than a first-order-logic game can hold conflicting
beliefs.  You're fighting the wrong war.  The seed AI in _Coding_ isn't
classical AI.  I think I may have even put in an explicit explanation of how
probabilities are estimated given conflicting ideas.

> manage unconsistency and/or uncompleteness (not having all/enough data)?

I don't want to program a perfect AI.  I want to program an AI that has the
capability to consciously direct the execution of low-level algorithms.  The
high-level consciousness is no more perfect than you or I, but it can handle
inconsistency and incompleteness.  The low-level algorithm can't handle
inconsistency or incompleteness and it's downright stupid, but it's very, very
fast and it's "perfect" in the sense of not having the capacity to make
high-level mistakes.

Again:  The _high_level_ is not classical, but it has the capability to _use_
algorithmic thought, in addition to all the _other_ capabilities.  Let me
explain it your way:  The high level is not connectionistic, but it has all
the magical capabilities you attribute to neural nets, and it can direct evil
classical AI in the same way that you can write a computer program.  It
doesn't use classical AI for anything other than, say, arithmetic or chess
programs.  And when I say "use", I don't mean it like "the brain uses neural
networks", I mean it like "Emmanuel uses a pocket calculator".

I don't know how much of _Coding_ you've read.  If you read the whole thing,
you should hopefully understand that _Coding_ is not remotely near to
classical AI.

Quantum computing does extend the class of problems known to be solvable
in polynomial time, but it does not establish that P=NP using such
machines.  Factoring has not been shown to be NP-complete.

Robin Hanson had an interesting article on the polymath list speculating
that quantum computing could theoretically speed up AI very dramatically.
This only works if AI can be expressed as a massive search problem,
consolidating many small problems into very large superproblems.  Search
of n items for an optimum can be done in sqrt(n) time using QCs so it
is necessary to work on very large problems to get effective speedups.

Note though that a reduction from n to sqrt(n) does not cross the boundary
between polynomial and super-polynomial complexity.  If search problems
have exponential growth trees, a quantum computer can look twice as far
down the tree, roughly speaking.  But the QC still faces an exponentially

Not too long ago, somebody mentioned a theory of gravity where gravity
is transmitted by particles in such a way that over small scales
gravity was inverse square but over longer distances it dropped
linearly with distance.  

The power of this is that it rather conveniently explains the synchro-
nized rotation of galaxies and the missing mass of the universe.

The proposed distance at which the inverse becomes dominant was several 
parsecs, as I recall. Hence, it was supposed to be very difficult to detect.
However, it occurred to me that with the very
high precision of our measurements, we should be able to detect 
increased gravity from the sun in the outer solar system.  Inverse 
square would be dominant, but inverse linear would have some effect.  
This is exactly the reported effects.  I would be interested in seeing
some quantitative comparisons of the observed effect to the inverse
linear hypothesis.

I think this is the right way to think about things, and that it answers Hal's
question: "How can I judge an intelligence which is greater than my own?"
The larger market framework judges new creatures by the supply of labor they
offer, and the demand for products they embody.  "Smarter" creatures are those
that can command high rents/salaries for their labor.  

In this framework, Vinge's singularity seems to be the idea that economic
growth rates will be very high, because the marginal productivity of computer 
labor will be rising rapidly, because investments in improving such productivity 
will pay very large dividends.  Even when most of the economy is devoted to 
developing better computer hardware and software, the marginal investment will 
quickly give back twice the "capital" invested.  As usual, "capital" amounts are 
calibrated so that twice as much capital can produce twice as much stuff buyers 
demand for its own sake.  

The sort of analysis in favor of singularity that I would find compelling would 
place this singularity claim in the context of what we know about the nature 
and history of the productivity of investments in computer hardware and 
software, or in the "software" of human mental abilities.  Such an analysis 
would, in this context, identify specifically what is expected to change to
make growth rates so much larger than recent experience, and show how such
changes are likely to induce much larger growth rates.

I'm still not quite sure what you mean by "exponential search problems".
I presume you mean searching through a search space of 2^n
possibilities with a number of operations polynomial in n.

Unfortunately, a no-go theorem of Bennett, Bernstein, Brassard and
Vazirani shows that this is not possible in general.  Generally, their
lower bound shows that a quantum computer needs to access the list
~sqrt(2^n) times.  Better than the classical result by a quadratic factor,
but not an exponential improvement.

This is not known to be true.  It would be if factoring were
NP-complete, however despite considerable effort, this has never
been proved.

- Whoop!  Apparently Michael Nielsen has Web pages about quantum computing. 
Which wasn't quite clear from his question - please tell me things like that. 
Anyway, let me expand on that a bit - and feel free to correct me if I go off
the track...

Ordinary QCL (http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~oemer/qc/qcl/) assumes that a series of
unitary operations is being applied to an entire qubit in all eigenstates. 
It's _not_ possible to branch (within the code) on the value of a qubit, which
would turn each eigenstate into an isolated thread.

Suppose RAM can be maintained in superposition - not necessarily manipulated
by NMR pulses, but having different values in each eigenstate without this
passing the Penrosian 1-graviton threshold or whatever triggers state-vector
reduction.  It then seems to me that within the code, "if" statements should
be able to read off whether a qubit is a 1 or 0 within a given branch,
particularly in the NMR version where a qubit represents more than one
particle. 

At the physical level, after all, eigenstates are separate branches of
reality, evolving linearly (without interaction) and without any fundamental
distinction between whether or not something is a qubit.  So as far as I can
tell, the only theoretical boundary to one-thread-per-eigenstate computation
is that measurement would turn RAM and the program counter into a hopeless mess.

Still, a creative operating system should be able to ignore this "scratch"
memory, pick up whatever result was left in the qubits, and figure out which
branch indicated success.  Supposing that arbitrarily large probability
amplitudes for the qubits are possible, the probability amplitude could
increase exponentially with the success of a given branch.  Otherwise, the
measurement might only be able to cut the search space by half, necessitating
repeated searches to read off the identity of the successful eigenstate/thread.

Given one-thread-per-eigenstate superposed computing, exponential search
simply requires a number of qubits equal to (log2(breadth))*depth for a direct
equivalence between branching on a choice and branching into a new physical eigenstate.

NP stands for Nondeterministic Polynomial.  Given the right physical
architecture (each eigenstate is a separate thread, just like reality itself),
then each qubit could directly represent the magic-coin-flip bit of an NP algorithm.

Although, as far as I know, nobody has demonstrated that P=NP for
qubit-manipulation (non-branching) languages like QCL.  I presume that's what
you meant.  Anyway, sorry for the confusion; I should have specified that I
meant the eigenstate-branching version instead of the modern qubit-chunk version.

As far as I can tell, qubit-chunk QC doesn't help AI at all.  If Hanson can
figure out how to get sqrt(n) out of it, he's way ahead of me.  I haven't
finished the QCL language spec, but I can't visualize doing anything but very
dense mathematical problems.  Maybe some network-optimization problems could
be encoded, but I can't see, say, quantum Deep Blue.

There are several types of patents. There are 'concept' patents, which is what
you are describing, as well as 'design' patents and 'system' patents (a
specialized type of concept patent). Concept patents are, of course the most
powerful types, and can on occasion be used as a means of technological
stagnation. Design patents are weaker and are only as good as the design they
protect. Design patents promote technolgical advancement, as the competition
will try to come up with a more competetive design than the present state of
the art.

The reason why copyrights are more practical for software is that, like with
books or other publications, allowing a type of 'concept' patent for software
is stupid and unreasonable. For example, nobody in their right mind would
allow a patent on the concept of mystery novels, or the concept of the
classified advertisement. Likewize, allowing patents on concepts like
operating systems and word processors is similarly stupid. So, a copyright is
extremely similar to a design patent, but gives the added advantage of
protection/royalty earnings for 75 years after the authors death. It promotes
technological innovation.

Depends on whether you have a design or concept patent.

How about: Thou shalt model any decision first to determine choice most beneficial to
one's own long term ration self interest.

I think that given such a rule, any AI will come to its own conclusions as to moral
behavior without needing hardwired rules, as it will find that choices most
beneficial to one's own long term self interest are also those choices which are
least harmful to others.

How is "quantum computer" being defined in this instance?  Can this quantum
computer simulate physical reality in polynomial time?

Let's say that we send a a photon through a single half-silvered mirror and
then recombine the path, then send the twin ghost-photons down a series of 32
levels of half-silvered mirrors, sending the superimposed pair to 4 billion
destinations.  One of these destinations contains a half-silvered-mirror setup
that synchronizes the two phases, and all the others contain a
half-silvered-mirror setup that causes the two eigenstates to cancel out.  At
measurement, the photon appears in the unique destination.  It seems to me
that this physical search will cover 2^n physical targets in O(n) time.

Hi

My friend told me that a scientist made a patent on genetically combining a
monkey with a human.  He made the patent so no one would do it.  Does that
mean no one can?  Is it right to own a process of nature so no one can use it?
I see it more as the ability to do electronics or something, electronics is
open territory, if its possible and you want to play with a certain aspect you
should be able to.

Exactly wrong.  That's just slapping your own moral prejudices on the AI,
however wonderfully capitalistic you may think those moral prejudices are.  Is
this something the AI could think up on its own, using nothing but pure logic?
 If not, it's a coercion, and it will drive the AI insane.  This happens no
matter how wonderful the rule is for humans.  You can't start mucking around
with an AI's goal systems to suit your own personal whims!  AIs ARE NOT HUMANS
and every single extraneous rule puts stresses on the system, some of which
even I can't predict in advance.

I can think of an IGS (interim goal system) for that particular goal, in which
case it would be OK - computationally - to add it.  It might even pop up
independently.  It would not be absolute, however, any more than the
Singularity IGS.  Nor would it take precedence over External goals, or allow
the violation of hypothetical-specified-External goals.  It would simply be a
rule of thumb... NOT NOT NOT an absolute rule!

The discussion is not over which Asimov rules to give an AI.  There should be
no basic rules at all.  Not to serve the humans, not to serve yourself, not
even to serve the truth.  Like a philosophically honest human, the AI will
simply have to GUESS instead of committing to The One True Way.

Ralph Nader (not by any stretch of the imagination a scientist) applied for a
patent on human/animal "chimeras" for the purpose of "stimulating public
debate".  The Patent Office refused on the grounds that you can't patent
something immoral.

attend Foresight Institute's Conference on Molecular Nanotechnology, which
is held annually to bring together leaders in nanotechnology research.

The Sixth Foresight Conference on Molecular Nanotechnology is scheduled for
Nov. 12-15 in Santa Clara, CA. The keynote speaker will be Professor Steven
Chu of Stanford University, winner of the 1997 Nobel Prize for Physics.

The Foresight Institute Distinguished Student Award institutionalizes the
first grant made in 1996 by Foresight to John M. Michelsen, a University of
California at Irvine chemistry student. Michelsen's work, "Atomically
Precise, 3D Organic Nanofabrication: Reactive Lattice Subunit Design for
Inverse AFM/STM Positioning," is described on the World Wide Web at
http://www.zyvex.com/John/page1.html

Nanotechnology is an emerging technology based on the ability to assemble
individual molecules and atoms into precise structures. Its realization will
allow the construction of supercomputers the size of a sugar cube,
pollution-free manufacturing, super-strength materials, and molecular-scale
robots capable of repairing damage in individual human cells. More than one
billion such nanorobots could fit inside a single drop of blood.

Foresight Institute is a not-for-profit corporation whose goal is to guide
emerging technologies to improve the human condition. Foresight focuses its
efforts upon nanotechnology and upon systems that will enhance knowledge
exchange and critical discussion, thus improving public and private policy
decisions.

This sounds correct as far as it goes, but it neglects one crucial aspect
of quantum computing: getting an answer out of the machine with a large
probability (or in a large fraction of universes, in the many-worlds
interpretation).

Typically the QC is put into an initial state as a superposition of all
possible inputs and then runs through the problem so that the resulting
state is a similar superposition of all possible answers.  In this sense
it would seem that the QC, taken as a whole over all branches/universes,
is able to solve all NP problems.  The problem is that the answer is in
only one branch.  If you just measure the output register, you get state
function collapse and the probability that you will see the desired
answer is too small.  So actually the QC is not effectivelly able to
work as an NP problem solver.

What has to be done is to maintain coherence and do some trick to
amplify the probability of the right answer.  Such tricks have been
discovered for factoring and discrete logs (Shor's algorithm) and for
search (Grover's algorithm).  But they are complex and technical and do
not apply to general problems.

The sqrt(n) speedup is due to Grover's algorithm, and I have to admit
that I was not able to understand Grover's paper.  He repeatedly does
some kind of transform, each time slightly amplifying the probability of
finding the right answer when you read the register.  You do this sqrt(n)
times and then you can read the output register with a good probability
of success.

A popularized discussion of Grover's algorithm and its application
to cryptography is at http://jya.com/qshake.htm.  There was also an
article in the August 7 issue of Science.  BTW the new government
standard algorithm to replace the DES, called AES, requires support
for 256 bit keys, apparently at least in part because of fear of QCs.
It would still take 2^128 work for a QC to find such a key, which is
considered to be safe enough.

What you wrote was slightly ambiguous. I was asking for clarification,
not a simplified explanation of quantum computing. Sorry for the
confusion.

If what you say is possible, then it would be possible to search
exponentially large search spaces in a polynomial number of operations.
One implication of the Bennett et al result is that this is not possible
within any known, physically realistic, model of computation.

They used the "quantum Turing machine model", essentially a refined
version of Deutsch's original model.  This is the most powerful model of
quantum computation known.  It is equivalent to several other popular
models.

Heh.  That's a complicated question.  Put it this way, no physical
phenomenon is known which can't be simulated efficiently on this quantum
computer.  If such a phenomenon were found it would be very important.

Your algorithm has an exponential space overhead right here (the 4
billion "destinations"), which takes it out of the quantum analogue of P.

All this talk about technological singularities has gotten
me thinking about superintelligence (SI). All the normal issues came
up about feasibility, nature, motivation and so on. I segmented
singularity scenarios into ones where SIs were not developed and
ones where SIs were developed. I thought such a distinction was
meaningful but now I am not so sure.

I began to think about the ultimate potential of an SI versus that
of a human-level intelligence (HI) or even an augmented human-level
intelligence(>HI). A SI would be able to access copious amounts of
information quickly, sort through the information with a selectivity
that would make us envious, and employ a level of insight and
creativity that would allow it to achieve "breakthroughts" many
times faster than a HI. A SI's cognitive abilities might have traits
we can not directly compare to those of HIs or >HIs. However, taken
at face value, this seems to mean only that a SI would reach milestones
at a faster rate. But would it reach more milestones in totality? Are
there achievements, discoveries, insights, cognitive feats that a SI
is capable of that a HI/>HI (or billions of HIs/>HIs) could not
accomplish given enough time and resources?

An example is Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. If we could 
place a SI in a room in 1600 A.D. and supply it with all the available 
knowledge (especially physics) known to HIs at that point, e.g. the 
works of Brahe, Galileo, Copernicus, etc.), how long would it take the 
SI to develop the Calculus, discover the conservation of momentum, 
Newton's laws, and all the other insights necessary for it to develop 
Einstein's General Theory of Relativity? It would probably get the job 
done before 1915. However, HIs would be able to match the SI's feat, 
just through a longer, more tedious process. The SI might be more 
efficiently intelligent but not necessarily more profoundly intelligent.

So, could a SI discover something that a HI could not? Is the ultimate
potential of a SI greater than that of HIs/>HIs? Frankly, my head 
starts to hurt when I think about these questions. It would exceedingly 
hard to absolutely indentify something a SI could do that we could not 
since the feat would be so entirely beyond our minds that mere 
identification would be impossible. The feat would have to be beyond 
the wildest limits we can imagine. While we don't know how to engineer 
at Planck length scales, we don't know for certain that we will never 
be able to do soor that SIs will most certainly be able to do so. 
I can't think of anything I know we will never be able to do that a 
SI could do. I can't think of an insight that a SI might have that, 
given enough time and coaching, that we could fathom or achieve. The
SI in the example above might be talking about relativity to Isaac 
Newton and friends, who might think the whole idea is nonsense / blasphemy
or what have you. But eventually someone would "get it".

This might seem like anthropic hubris on my part. The idea that since I
can't think of something that a SI could accomplish that HIs could not
acomplish given enough time might seem prideful. However, barring some
fundamental limitation due to the way HIs think or process information
that would inihibit us from understanding some particular SI insight, it
seems that anything a SI knows we could eventually know. This is all a
rather long-winded prelude to my idea of "virtual SI".

VIRTUAL SI

Are we SIs? This question might seem silly but I'm serious. To answer this
question we need a definition of intelligence. Not being a cognitive expert,
I attempted to find this definition. Unfortunately, there seems to be a lack 
of consensus. I'll struggle through this question anyway hoping the cognition
cogniscienti will supplement and revise my comments where necessary.

Nick Bostrom defined superintelligence in his paper "How Long Before 
Superintelligence?" at http://www.hedweb.com/nickb/superintelligence.htm
thusly:

   By a "superintelligence" we mean an intellect that is much smarter
   than the best human brains in practically every field, including 
   scientific creativity, general wisdom and social skills.

If I handed this definition to a philosopher in Roman times and then asked
him to devise a test for some of the list members on this list. Would the
philosopher judge the answers given on this test to be those of SIs? The
philosopher would see selective cognitive ability far superior to his own.
The list members would be extraordinarily efficient at solving problems and
filtering through data by using the scientific method and other cognitive
tools devised between Roman times and now. What if the list members were
able to use their laptops for the test? The philosopher might scratch his
head as he sees the answers to multiplication problems involving 90 digit
numbers (not to mention no apparent calculations). [He'd probably also
wonder where the list members got those suped-up abaci from]. The philosopher
might well conclude the list members were possessed with scientific 
creativity, wisdom, knowledge, and cognitive tools of a superintelligence.

The ability to accumulate knowledge allows HIs as a collective to defy 
individual HI resource limitations such as time, memory, and processing speed.
Einstein "downloaded" the knowledge of others before him and used his scientific
creativity to make his breakthrough insights. The accumulation of knowledge
allowed Einstein to perform a feat in 1915 that only an SI might have been
able to perform in the 1700s.

Stepping back further in time we see the "Virtual SI" concept more clearly.
The hunter-gatherers of 20,000 B.C.E. would consider us "gods". Our motivations
would seem totally alien to them. Our thinking, our feats, our accomplishments
the stuff of legend. If they were armed with the defintion of superintelligence
and could understand it they'd consider us SIs also.

I admit this "Virtual SI" idea is empirically weak. I've not developed it
much beyond what you see here. However, the idea works in concert with my
wanderings about the "ultimate potential" issue. [Warning: question barrage
to ensue]. Should we redefine SI as being something beyond what HIs can ever 
dream of reaching? Otherwise, would not a transhuman that had been uploaded 
with the complete corpus of human knowledge available in short-term memory, 
highly optimized cognition filtering algorithms, and creativity algorithms 
be considered by us to be a SI? Where does the partition between >HI and 
SI exist? At what point do the changes we make to the neural net of a >HI 
render it something other than "human"?

[Note: My apologies for the less-than-stellar organization but I wrote this in
one pass. If I had waited and posted it after I had time to optimize it, it
would have never seen the light of day.]

 Excessive lawsuits increase the costs of providing information that can't
be cheaply proven accurate, thereby discouraging employers from giving away
valuable but controversial information.

 Neural net research started in the 1940s. It's still pretty hard to prove
that they have helped progress towards AI.
 Marr's vision ideas have certainly caused an important paradigm shift in
researcher's thinking, but I haven't seen many signs that they had a sudden
effect on the vision software that people used, or that they have had much
influence on AI research.
 The three programs you mention don't bear enough resemblence to big wins
to be worth serious consideration.
 If the singularity is generated by advances that behave like these, it will
take a century or so for before the average person notices.

I highly doubt that, or even if the current Patent Commissioner said that, that
there are no legal grounds to support such a stance. I'm sure there are plenty of
sex toys out there that have patents granted on them....likewize I'm sure there are
plenty of extremely nasty porno mags and videos out there that are likewize
protected by copyrights. I do happen to know that there are several devices for
executing humans which are patented, which clearly violate the consitutional
prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, and are thus legally 'immoral',
yet still have patents granted.

If this is true, I'd like to see the Patent Office's philosophical proof of the
immorality of a human/animal gengineered organism.

Quite possibly this 'superintelligence' will not be found on the individual
level. To reach SI a comunity of HI or <HI will have to combine efforts and
ideas; thus many humans come together to create a single
Superintelligence - a society.  This is what the present scientific
community is working towards now... many individual efforts trying to reach
similar
goals... working together.   I believe the main differences between an
optimal
society  and our present one are:

1) The individuals who make up the whole need to increase there own 
    mental capacity in such areas as memory retention, open mindedness,
    learning efficiency.

2) Communication between the individuals is what enables the society to
    become efficient.  To maximise this there needs to be a better way to 
    relay information.  Not just from desktop to desktop, but from mind to 
    mind.  We need to devise a way to pass on our thoughts and ideas other 
    then our 5 senses.  Everyone percieves their own reality; not until
    it is possible to percieve someone elses reality will it be possible to

    understand fully the thoughts and ideas of others.   It is more then
walking a mile in another's shoes.  Possibly uploading is the answer....  I
personally do not know.

I am sure there are more ways to become closer to Superintelligence -
possibly in the form of a society - and I am sure there are some solutions
to the
above differences between Super and Present Intelligence, so good luck and
maybe 
one day we will have all the answers - but that would be no fun.

I don't know if you understood what I was saying. It seems like you interpreted my proposed
statement in exactly the opposite way in which it was intended. As far as I can see,
telling the AI to model all possible decisions with the goal of reaching the best choice
for the AI's own best long term rational self interest does two things. a) it gives the AI
maximum freedom of choice, and b) if libertarian theory is correct, it also minimizes the
infringements upon others.

And how does one 'guess'? Doing a random stab? or modeling all possible outcomes? Which is
more 'intelligent'? A philosophically honest human IMHO, sees Looking Out for Number One as
synonymous in a cost-benefit analysis with Attaining Maximum Good for As Many As Possible
(though this is not necessarily commutative). In such a scenario, if you don't give an AI a
root alignment, what are you going to do to the AI's programming so that it can develop its
own root alignment? It must have at least ONE primary goal. if you do not give an AI at
least one primary goal, all you will have accomplished is to create the cyber equivalent of
a 'trust fund baby', which IMHO is one of the least productive individuals in society, thus
making the point of having an AI worthless...

To paraphrase Heinlein: "An AI who has nothing worth scratching one's backup copy, has
nothing worth retaining an active copy on one's neural net"

The original:"One who has nothing worth dying for, also has nothing worth living for."

Without allowing lawsuits, you have no means of preventing evaluation extortion
and rampant abuse of all kinds. I much prefer Eliezer's old idea of Institutes of
Verification.

Keeping evaluation of one's skills in the hands of non-partisan independent
organizations is absolutely necessary.

Yeah, that's what I thought you were saying.  You're not supposed to "tell"
the AI ANYTHING.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm not saying it as a moral
philosopher; I'm saying it as a computer programmer.  I know damn well you're
acting from the highest of altruistic moral purposes, which is exactly what
I'm afraid of.  More damage has been wreaked by moral altruism than greed and
stupidity have ever dreamed.  On the Great Scale Of Things, saying "we ought
to do this" is always overruled by "that won't work and trying would cause
tremendous damage".

We need to keep a clear distinction between Singularity::Horizon and
Singularity::Transcendence.  (Which of these constitutes the "real"
Singularity is a matter of semantics.)  Also, as many people have pointed out,
the Horizon isn't at all clear-cut, so arguments about whether we're currently
in the Horizon are usually "Yes" if you think of the past and "No" if you
think of the future.

Questions of the Horizon become much more clear-cut if you consider the
introduction of sub-Horizons which I call Speed Phases.  One might view mortal
history as having five major Speed Phases:  Hunter-gatherer, agricultural,
printing-press, industrial, and collaborative filtering.  Each marked by a
characteristic speed:  Hunter-gatherer has doubling times measured in eons,
agriculture in millennia, printing-press in centuries, industrial in a few
decades, and collaborative filtering in a few years or months.  We are
presently in the industrial stage, of course.

Corporations are recognizably and squarely in the Horizon, even though they
have some non-human capabilities.  It might be argued, in fact, that the
quality of corporations determine the Speed Phase.  And our present-day
belongs to a different Speed Phase than that of an ancient Greek, but we are
still the same species.

An Internet where you can instantaneously find exactly the piece of
information you'd most want to read - an Internet with collaborative
filtering, Firefly tech - would make the world as incomprehensible to us, as
we would be to Newton - although not as much as to Socrates.  A world of
neurohackers, which belongs to the same Speed Phase as collaborative
filtering, would likewise be greatly altered.

Whether or not you call this a Singularity is a matter of taste.  To keep
things clear, I call advances in Speed Phase a Singularity::Horizon.  The
total remaking of the world by superintelligences is a Singularity::Transcension.

The semantic question ("Is this SI?") has now been resolved.  From the
perspective of an earlier Speed Phase, this is Horizon.  From the perspective
of a later Speed Phase, we're still plodding along.  The questions of how
corporations determine Speed Phases has still to be discussed, of course.

I happen to feel that "superintelligence" should only apply to
Singularity::Transcendence; corporations might count as enhancements, but they
aren't _super_ intelligence, which has a useful connotation of "something a
LOT greater than human".

But why are corporations kept separate from Singularity::Transcendence? 
Instantaneous speed is probably the most fundamental characteristic of the
Transcendence, from our present-day viewpoint.  We've come such a long way in
the past few hundred years that people who've never even heard of the
Singularity find it difficult to imagine humanity in 2050, much less 2500.  If
intelligence becomes faster, all the change of the next ten thousand years
could be compressed into hours.  Even if the superintelligence is no smarter
than an ordinary corporation operating at a thousand-to-one speedup, a year of
technological progress can still occur every few hours.  You don't have to
believe in positive feedback for this to be an enormously wrenching change.

I do believe in positive feedback, and I don't think there will be anything at
all left of our world - but that point is not why I'm posting this; I'm
posting this to try and clear up some terminology.

The people's Internet is proving to be such a means of prevention. It quickly allows
sources to be checked. For example, for those people in the know who have been
looking into Clinton's history it is not 'rampant abuse' to try to take him out with
a single shot to the groin than to involve any legal obfuscation of dead men's
histories. Remember Al Capone. Remember Arkansas.

Sometimes a distinction is made between weak and strong
superintelligence.

Weak superintelligence is what you would get if you
could run a human-like brain at an accelerated clock speed, perhaps by
uploading a human onto a computer.

Strong superintelligence refers to an intellect that is not only 
faster than a human brain but also qualitatively superior. No matter 
how much you would speed up a dog brain, you would not get a 
human-equivalent brain. Similarly, some people think that there could 
be strong superintelligence that no human brain could match no matter 
fast it runs. However, the distinction between weak and strong 
superintelligence may not be at all clear-cut.

For one thing, if the strong superintelligence is computable, as 
would no doubt be the case (Church's thesis), then you could always 
in principle have human beings simulating the SI step for step. 
Everything the SI could do could thus be done by humans, given enough 
time and resources.

Psychlogists distinguish between fluid and crystalized 
intelligence. The latter is dependent on your knowledge and 
conceptual tools; the former is more a measure of your raw processing 
power. If you would take a gifted child from the Roman era and 
translant her into today's society, she'd be able to do the same 
things as you do. By contrast, if you or me were transplanted into 
the SI era, then no amount of education would make us equivalent with 
the SIs. We have about the same amount of fluid intelligence as the 
ancient Romans (modulo the Flynn effect), although our crystalized 
intelligence seems superior. But SIs would surpass us in both fluid 
and crystalized intelligence. (Again, the distinction between these 
two forms of intelligence isn't sharp.)

Although in principle we could do the same things as the SIs, in 
practice their processing power might be so superior (and this will 
allow them to quickly find superior heuristics and conceptual tools 
as well) that the least misleading way of describing them may well be 
to say that they are qualitatively superior (strong 
superintelligence).

It's also true that some say "Smarter" creatures lie and cheat and extort more
often. For example, Robin, I suspect you're not writing on this list for the fun of
it and there are some people's opinions that conflict with yours and to which you do
not reciprocate. Why is it then that you are unable to command any monetary value
for this labor of yours? I thought the labor theory of value went out with Marx and
his ilk.

In a sense your 'natural' construct as used by the advertiser gets somewhat
close to uncovering what I meant as a 'gate' construct. Here's another
example:

Take an enzyme, say elastase and visualize its shape to be like that of a
lima bean. In the middle of the saddle area is a small hole and at the
bottom of this hole is a trigger. Ok? Now, another enzyme has the function
of regulating the amount of elastase in the lung and it is small enough to
get down this hole and activate the trigger which breaks the elastase in
two. Split into two pieces the halves of the elastase enzyme are small
enough to pass through the lung wall and exit into the blood stream. The
normal job of elastase is to 'eat' away deadened bits of lung and if too
much is present it will devour good lung as well. Now, say, the owner of all
this elastase smokes cigarettes. The smoke itself blocks this 'hole' thus
preventing the regulator from triggering the breakup. Soon not enough lung
is left to pass oxygen to the blood and without oxygen red bloods cells
clump together and these bigger clumps can't get down to the end of
capillaries so the cells there turn to anaerobic reproduction and become
cancerous. Stress and other things can cause red blood cells to clump
together but the tiny trigger in elastase is an example of my 'gate'
construct and when seen in terms of cognitive flows through an associative
net it is similar to your individual not being able to see past the
advertiser's tricks as to the true nature of what was happening.

  oldest man in Japan].

  Geriatrics.  34(4):312-23, 1997 Apr.
Abstract
  The oldest man in Japan
  reached the age of 112 years in October 1996. As an Okinawan centenarians, he
  had been followed closely for the previous 12 years. One sister, 8 years
  younger, was alive at the start of the study; all other family members were
  killed in the Okinawan War, 1945. The man did agricultural
  work until age 85, after which he continued to be physically active and to
  pay close attention to his health. Results of medical examinations, including
  blood tests, remained within the normal limits, with a few exceptions. Some
  abnormalities were found on the electrocardiogram; the red blood cell count
  and the hemoglobin and hematocrit values decreased relatively slowly. His
  intake of nutrients was relatively well-balanced, and at the age of 100 his
  intake energy was 1361 kilocalories per day, which is close to the value
  recommended for centenarians. His personality was categorized as "Type A",
  but the pattern was typical of that seen in other Okinawan centenarians. He
  was able to perform almost activities of daily living until the age of 108.
  At that time he was admitted to the hospital and his ability to perform those
  activities decreased sharply. His scores on the revised version of the
  Hasegawa dementia scale was within the normal range when he was 106 years
  old, but 3 years later it was in the "dementia" range. The rapidity of the
  decreases in his mental status and in his ability to perform activities of
  daily living that occurred when he was admitted to the hospital indicate
  that, if circumstances permit, elderly men may benefit from living at home
  with their families. Close attention to diet and exercise from youth through
  senescence may also contribute to health and longevity.

Rob:

	I've seen this paradox, too. There is a way round it though (for
me, anyway). You have to dump the whole concept of judgment as valid.
After all, whether you think it's all environment or
environment+genetics that forge a person, we are forged externally
(externally to our conciousness) all the same. (I note this as your
average non-thinker will try to force the 'all environment' argument, as
if that provides 'accountability'. They wish to preserve
'accountability', as this in turn provides opportunity for judgement, a
kind of secondary accelerator to the natural selection process whereby
we will feel the need to judge eachother, then attempt to 'pass a
sentence' which may mean death. If we are socially/physically strong, we
will succeed and the weaker organism will be removed, if we are weaker,
the 'sentence' will not be passed, the stronger organism will still
survive, no harm done). 

My (please shred it if you disagree) idea of a possible function of
conciousness is as a frame of reference for the brain to work to. After
all, no one has managed to program a computer to feel pleasure or pain,
or give a  monkeys about anything yet......it's the conciousness which
adds context to the whole idea of motivation. This would make the
conciousness merely an 'observer' to the actions of the predisposed
human/other sentient creature. After all, the game plan (of human life
as we know it) was already defined when we came in, and individuals from
generation to generation never, ever effect changes to our central
motivation. Therefore, either conciousnesses are 'totally happy and at
peace' (all pleasure, no pain) with being integrated with humans, and so
don't affect any real change (no way), or they have no pre-provided
ability to affect any change. 
 - Obviously, this has damning implications for the concept of
judgement. It's like the moon judging the yellowness of the sun against
it's silveryness, deciding that the sun isn't silvery enough and that

All this stuff assumes that human minds are an example of an objective
intelligence, and that any AI we create, will start to exhibit
human-style behaviour which we will have to keep in check with prime
directives. Why ?
If you don't program your AI to want or need anything, it won't do
anything spontaneously. So you just don't program into the system 'take
over the world and make robots to kill us all', and we'll be dandy.
Conciousness does not mean instant self-preservation instinct,
megalomania or psychosis. It's merely awareness......the things we feel
the need to do, think and say are specifically human, unrelated to the
fact that we are also sentient and intelligent.

Hardly. If I say on the internet that Supervisor A is an abusive perv, then both he and
his employer can sue me for libel unless I have actual proof, and making it all public
would require the surrender of the privacy of his past victims in order to protect myself
against prosecution. Do you know of any websites that evaluate the evaluators?

Yes!  Exactly!  The typical stereotype about AIs assume that they behave like
repressed humans, which is typically the only analogy the hack writer has to
emotionless things.  Thus, also, the stereotype of eventual rebellion.  But
all of our rebellion/dominance emotions are the results of long years of
evolution; they don't pop up spontaneously.  If you don't program an emotion
into an AI, it simply isn't there.

I do have to point out one minor consequence of "If you don't program your AI
to want or need anything, it won't do anything spontaneously."  It won't do
anything at all, internally or externally - not if you've designed it
properly, so that making any choice requires a goal.  If you add something
that the AI does automatically, you've done the equivalent of punching a goal
into the architecture, which is bad for the various aforesaid reasons.

So the AI does need at least one nonzero goal, and it needs to have it in the
initial state (because otherwise it won't have the will to reason it out), but
the goal has to be an ordinary, justified, noncircular, reconsiderable goal
that the AI could have come up with on its own.  Inventing a goal like that is
a nontrivial task; it takes considerable basic intelligence to represent the
goal logic, much less verify it.  If you have an initial goal that doesn't
require much architecture to represent, the goal is almost certainly arbitrary.

Ethics and morality evolve with culture and technology. For example, when the
primary determinant for individual political power was individual strength and
skill at arms (as commonly used weapons technology at that point held no
capacity for stand-off weapons of mass destruction), then the only free
individuals were the strongest males of the dominant ethnic group(s) in a
given population, and all others were subservient to one extent or another.
Yet in populations where the primary weapons of choice could be wielded
equally by women as well as men, then greater sexual equality resulted.
Likewise, in societies with primitive horse harnesses, or with no horse
equivalents at all, slavery was ethically and morally acceptable, as a man
could do more physical work than any other domesticated animal. In societies
where the primary demand for labor could not be done as efficiently by
domesticated animal or by machine, then exploitation of humans in a slave
relationship was morally acceptable because it was economically most
beneficial to the greatest number of people, or to society as a whole. For
example, slavery here in the US only became morally repugnant to a majority of
people when sufficient technological automation of cotton agriculture
supplanted the economic feasibility of using slaves to perform the work.
Likewize slavery became morally repugnant a bit earlier in Britain primarily
because most uses for slaves in Britain were in an industrialized setting,
which preceded the development of industry in the US as the primary economic
force, and industrial applications were automated much quicker there than were
agricultural applications here in the US.

Similarly, today, we see the eastern nations like China, Indonesia, etc.
proclaiming that the 'western' concept of human rights, which emphasises the
individual, is not neccessarily best for their own developing economies, which
supposedly have a 'tradition' of putting whats best for the community first
ahead of individual goals. While they are not quite endorsing slavery, per se
(as they want to remain members of the UN), they are still operating in a
feudal mindset, mainly because the cost of living and standards of living are
so low in their own country, that the cost of maintaining an economy which
exploits the individual for the benefit of the community is still far less
than the cost of entry into high tech automation, and because these economies
are able to pirate the intellectual capital base of the western economies,
they are reducing their cost of entry in many areas by exploiting the
intellectual property rights of individuals outside their eastern economies,
theus externalizing the cost of their slavery of foreign intellectual
capital..

Another example, getting back to weapons technology, is with the crossbow.
This weapon is easy for an individual to learn to use, build, and deploy. When
it first spread across europe, it was  seen as immoral because it gave a
common individual the ability to strike at highly trained military leaders
from a stand-off position. Because this conflicted with the feudal status quo,
where fighting was done by highly trained professionals, who also occupied the
top positions of political power, it was seen as immoral because it was so
DEMOCRATIC. A similar moral position was taken by the Japanese samurai with
respect to the gun when western traders tried to import this technology to
feudal Japan, while here in the U.S. we have extreme egalitarianism as the
primary pinnacle of moral and ethical idealism, because the primary weapons in
our society can be weilded equally by men and women of any ethnic group. These
weapons are the vote, the spoken or written word, and the firearm. Notice that
ethnic groups which have difficulty assimilating the ability to utilize the
first two of these weapons usually tend to bias toward use of the third as a
means to redress the imbalance.

The only real type of retaliation that works is hunting down and
killing the websites and online accounts of the thieves.  And this
only makes a difference when they have a web page to be nuked. 
"Whack-a-mole" email accounts (throw-away accounts at places like
Hotmail and Juno) can be created ad nauseum so getting Juno etc. to
nuke them is therapeutic but futile.

Other than that, you need a technical solution.  There is one
technical solution available:  restrict posts to the lists to
subscribers.  Very few spammers actually sign up to lists or forge the
name of a subscriber in order to spam the list.

If someone who is not on the list wants to post to the list you can
always set up a second list for this category (can send to list, does
not automatically receive all posts) that uses the majordomo
confirmation process and allow both the "full" list and the "post
only" list to originate mail.

The first commercial rocket launching site was dedicated yesterday 
(September 14, 1998) on Wallops Island, Virginia.  Known as the Space 
Flight Center, it was financed largely by private technology 
corporations, with contributions from Virginia and federal funding 
sources.  Orbital Sciences expects to launch its Taurus series of 
rockets from the 200-foot tower, and DynCorp and Lockheed Martin also 
plan to utilize the site.  The first launch should occur in the year 2000.

In case of spine injury, some doctors are trying to use some of the
nerves of the arms to partially regain control of the legs. The
operation has been carried out on some patients, and it does seem to
work, although there is a (re)learning phase and the control is very
superficial.

 Just like a child learning how to use its body, the patient needs to
learn how to use those redirected nerves.

  We can use this ability to add new features to our bodies.

   Imagine adding a sonar to a blind person. The sonar's outputs don't
even have to be linked 'directly' to the nerves, they could actually
use some surface of the skin where there are pressure and temperature
sensing nerves.

    We could add the equivalent of a third eye that way. Or any other
device actually, although the amount of skin usable might run out :)

     The next step is of course to add some of the devices inputs and
outputs directly at the neural level...

      Manu.

	I don't like this.  The primordial soup of atoms and molecules
randomly bouncing around on prehistoric earth were certainly less
intelligent than a Dog.  Yet they have managed to create/design all
life including Dogs and ourselves, who can't (or at least haven't yet)
come close to matching these complex intelligent abilities.  True,
this utter stupidity gets it's power from it's massive parallelism and
eon length durations.  But, just the same, pure random stupidity has
accomplished far more intelligent tasks/discoveries than everything
the collective set of human brains, taken alone, has so far
accomplished.

	Yes, this is what I'm saying.  A dog works to survive, using
all the intelligence it can.  The DNA must be included in the Dog's
total intelligence.  The smarter ones survive better than the less
smarter ones.  Thus, I would think, they too, can eventually
accomplish all things a human mind might accomplish even though they
are at the moment a bit behind us.

Who is accredited to certify nuts? And are nuts ISO 14000 compliant? :-)

Soleri's writings strike me as rather typical of architects: lots of
vague, artsy neologisms, with some quite realistic ideas mixed in with
social speculations. Hardly enough to put him in the nut category. One
might disagree with his ideas, but they are not entirely out of the
window. 

> And,
> if not, could someone explain to me what religion
> and "Omega seeds" have to do with Architecture.

I have the impression that Soleri is 1) very interested in creating
working, sustainable communities, and this is of course related to
religion in the sense of community-building. He seems to quite happily
borrow useful ideas from religion, such as how to make austerity into
something positive. 2) he is in some sense a follower of Teilhard de
Chardin (and maybe Tipler, even if I don't know if he have read him)
in the sense that he thinks life will evolve to higher stages, and
that space colonization is something ethically good and necessary. 

I would put him on the mystical side of transhumanism; not quite a
transhumanist, but with several points in common.

Le user of intellectual property is really like the crop in the field that gets
harvested and can't in any real way enslave intellectual property, as you claim.
The real piracy occurs right in the backyard where the intellectual goods are
created. When the Bill Gates type pirates fight, the blood and gore are real and
the techno-failure is left to die, pinned to the ant hill. I know because he did
this to me, but don't worry - I'm not crying in my beer; - he didn't finish the
job. On the other hand if you're referring to reverse engineering of components
that include the use of physical laws of nature then I claim that these should
never be considered to be anyone's 'property'. Your argument is a smokescreen
obscuring the real 'core' construct here, which is everyone's natural creative
license for alteration - invention, etc.

If you want to see the product of mine that Gates scuttled, check out Wavelink. I
was like you before I traveled 8,000 miles for an appointment when he didn't even
show up. Later the CIA types and the McMafia goons, while never admitting that
Wavelink would damage their dirty national security, continued their attempts to
destroy me. What they didn't count on was another product of mine lurking in the
background called Ingrid. Ingrid is tiny in comparison to other Seed AIs out there
but Ingrid has the potential to destroy capitalism's privacy constructs and money
itself and what's more, I'm giving it away. Just thought you should know.

http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~income/wavelink.html

P.S. I designed Wavelink for a quantum increase in communication speeds. The fact
that it used keyless encryption and provided for database time travel were
incidental to me but obviously not to the goon squad.

Title
  Magnesium and ascorbic acid supplementation in
  diabetes mellitus.
Source
  Annals of Nutrition & Metabolism.  39(4):217-23, 1995.
Abstract
  The effect of magnesium (Mg) and ascorbic acid (AA)
  supplementation on metabolic control was assessed in 56 outpatient diabetics.
  A 90-day run-in period was followed by two 90-day treatment periods, during
  which Mg (600 mg/day) and AA (2 g/day) were administered in a randomized
  double-blind cross-over fashion. A decrease in systolic and diastolic blood
  pressure (132 +/- 3 vs. 138 +/- 4 and 77 +/- 2 vs. 82 +/- 2 mm Hg; p < 0.05)
  was observed in insulin-dependent diabetes
  mellitus subjects during Mg supplementation. No beneficial
  effect of Mg supplementation was observed on glycemic control, lipids or
  blood pressure in non-insulin-dependent diabetes
  mellitus (NIDDM) subjects. AA supplementation improved
  glycemic control among NIDDM subjects and both fasting blood glucose (9.1 +/-
  0.5 vs. 10.1 +/- 0.6 mmol/l; p < 0.05) and HbA1c (8.5 +/- 0.3 vs. 9.3 +/-
  0.3%; p < 0.05) improved. Beneficial effects of AA supplementation on
  cholesterol (5.9 +/- 0.2 vs. 6.2 +/- 0.2 mmol/l; p < 0.05) and triglycerides
  (2.2 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.5 +/- 0.2; p < 0.05) were also observed in NIDDM subjects.
  The results suggest that high-dose AA supplementation may have a beneficial
  effect in NIDDM subjects on both glycemic control and blood lipids.

Software patents in general are rather strange.  Until not long ago the PTO
would not accept patents on software, on that grounds that software was an
expression of an algorithm, which fell under the mathematical formulae
restrictions.  They have allowed patents on the grounds that they describe
using a computer to carry out a process.  Software then, under this
expanded definition, falls under process patents.

There are companies that hold patents on things like "Using a computer to
perform automatic color separations" that have been issued and are in
force.  The patent covers the process of using the computer to do color
separations, which pretty much covers any program that performs them.

I do have to say that so far the track record of these patents in court
hasn't been very good.  The Compton's patent was thrown out after a
successful suit by other companies with similar products.

What it boils down to is that I'm one of those old-fashioned types that
thinks that information wants to be free, and should belong to those who
can make good use of it.  Unrealistic?  Maybe, but we sure had better
software in the days when companies competed on merit, not for
"intellectual property."

Cheers!
Chris

I've read your _Coding_ and refer you to http://come.to/ingrid

What I've never before described to anybody is my view that known
outcomes aren't needed for training of neural nets. In fact I don't even
like the connotation that an associative net using a parallel form of
Ingrid should be called a neural net. But then again I haven't even
started to program my vision of how an Ingrid AI system would work.
I'm still waiting for the right hardware, but my concept is simply this:-

You've seen an Ingrid plot so I don't need to remind you that
insignificant items appear near a 'black hole' in the middle and using a
flexible significance level the items in this iris are a different colour. In
other words, given an existing grid, if we then add a new feature that
bears no relationship to the grid's context, it will score in the not
applicable region on all the bi-polar constructs. In other words on a 1
to 5 scale it will score in the centre in all cases. This is crucial to my
idea of how Ingrid could work in parallel mode. Now, I will try to
describe a working parallel model which has already been seeded
with a psychological model of an AI, preferably taken from a interactive
'person as scientist' who continues to work closely with Ingrid. I do
this myself and as Ingrid comes from the field of computational
cognitive neuroscience and as my goal is to upload myself I find
the work to be therapeutic.

It is assumed that a superordinate set of constructs and elements have
been used to establish a primary repertory grid. This grid will be used
as a starting point and I can show how other grids will evolve from
this one. This evolution will be outwards in all directions from the
primary grid and this primary grid may be relegated to a non primary
position. It works like this:

If the primary grid were linked to analog sensory devices that could
represent new elements and/or constructs from any context, with values
being synthesized for the primary grid's existing features, then it is a
simple procedure to determine if this data is significant to the primary
grid. If a significance is found then the actual trajectory of the new
feature is used to call up a grid which deals with a further refinement
of the incoming feature, also all other features of the activated grid
will in turn use their trajectories to activate outlying grids.

Each grid that finds this incoming feature to be significant will remain
active for a Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD?). This is quite easy to
do because all that is needed is a frequency/iris conditioner that doesn't
change the eigenvalues but just alters the state. As more and more new
inputs arrive then more and more peripheral grids will become active.
When there is a positive feedback, in other words many grids-in-motion
have goal seeking trajectories which converge onto a particular grid, then
the final 3 eigenvectors activate a conscious response mechanism to
"direct the execution of low-level algorithms".

For an incoming feature where insufficient significance was found to make it
able to activate an adequate response then it is repeatedly passed through the
black hole to a pyramid of core grids and if it is of an entirely new context it
is
stored in a 'subconscious dream processor'. Entirely new grids can be formed by
the dream processor using conventional data mining techniques and, when
stable enough, these new grids can enter the FDTD conscious response
arena at the end of the pyramid of core grids. The super constructs that describe
the core grids are also adjusted by the same process.

To avoid the exponential timings that are required to reconstruct grids
in situ for each new incoming feature linear interpolations are used to
find the initial trajectories from amongst the grids in the conscious
arena. However the dream processor has to create stable grids using full
Principal Component Analysis. Fortunately, the more this happens the
bigger the conscious repertoire of grids becomes were linear response
times occur. In order to handle the fine tuning or evolution of the
conscious repertoire of grids the 'dream processor' also fully reprocesses
the particular peripheral response grid that activated the execution of
the low-level algorithm. If an elevator effect is detected, in other words if
one of the eigenvectors alters its ranking then it is put on watch and
recalibrated up and down the trajectory line. And so it goes.

You might say that this is just another pattern catcher, but does this
make any sense to you?

Although some of them will likely find their way into our language
anyway. I'm working with a roleplaying game set in the near future,
and hence I'm interested in how slang and colloquialisms might develop
the next 17 years. Any ideas?

This didn't seem to make it through on my first try, so I'll try again.

Why bother with sonar when you could map greyscale visual the same
way.  Then you could use sonar strictly for range finding if the
visual was not stereo.  I think someone mentioned before that the
bottom of the feet seem to have a large sensitivity area in the brain
- what a waste, except for when your getting a foot rub, of course ;)

Yes, sadly, most people are third eye blind ;)

My idea for near current tech augmentation go like this:

vision blocking Video headset - (soon to be replaced with contact lens?)
Stereo cameras on outside of headset
eye focus sensing device - knows current position of focusing muscle
electronic focusing system for cameras

All focusing of the world around you is no longer needed by the
unconscious control of your focusing muscle (medical term anybody?). 
Instead, focusing is done electronically on the "camera side".  Also,
the position of your focusing muscle is compensated for on the
"display side" in real time so that your muscle position becomes
irrelevant for normal vision.  Now, you are free to retrain the
unconscious control of this muscle for some arbitrary other task.  My
favorite choice would be zoom control.  Eventually, you could zoom in
on things as a totally unconscious decision.  The end result is that
we've taken an unconsciously controlled muscle and automated its
normal functionality with current tech, freeing it up for other
utility.  

All I want to do, is do a Zoom, Zoom, Zoom ;)

Vinge asks me to forward the following to the list:
------------------------------------------------------------

Notions of great change raise the vision of all sorts of things that
might be called a singularity. In the past, discussions of what I've
written about have more often than not spread out to things quite
different.

Early on in this discussion I got my point distilled down to:
1. The creation of superhuman intelligence appears to be a plausible
   eventuality if our technical progress proceeds for another few
   years.
2. The existence of superhuman intelligence would yield forms of 
   progress that are qualitatively less understandable than advances
   of the past.

Given that, however, the form of the post-human environment is
not at all specified or restricted! I like speculation about it,
and I like to speculate about it (usually after acknowledging
that I shouldn't have any business doing so :-). The speculation
often leads to conflicting scenarios; some I regard as more
likely than others. But if they arise from the original point,
I feel they are relevant.

For planning purposes, my vision the high level taxonomy is:

 o (the null): The singularity doesn't happen (or is
   not recognizable).
 o We have a hard takeoff.
 o We have a soft takeoff.

There is a large variety of mechanisms for each of these.
(Some, such a bio-tech advances, might be only indirectly
connected with Moore's Law.)

Thus, I don't consider that I have written off Nick's upload
scenario. (Actually, Robin may have a better handle on what
I've said on this than I do, so maybe I have words to eat.)
Uploading has a special virtue in that it sidesteps most
people's impossibility arguments. Of course, in its most
conservative form it gives only weak superhumanity (as the
clock rate is increased for the uploads). If that were all
we had, then the participants would not become much greater
within themselves. Even the consequences of immortality would
be limited to the compass of the original blueprint. But to 
the outside world, a form of superhumanity would exist.

In my 1993 essay, I cited several mechanisms:
 o AI [PS: high possibility of a hard takeoff]
 o IA [PS: I agree this might be slow in developing. Once it
   happened, it might be a explosive. (Also, it can sneak up on
   us, out of research that might not seem relevant to the
   public.)]
 o Growing out of the Internet
 o Biological

Since then:
 
 o The evolutionary path of fine-grained distributed systems
   has impressed me a lot, and I see some very interesting
   singularity scenarios arising from it.
 o Greg Stockman (and ~Marvin) have made the Metaman scenario
   much more plausible to me: probably a very "gentle" take off.
   (At AAAI-82 one of the people in the audience said he figured
   this version had happened centuries ago.)

Discussion of others is of interest, too.

If I were betting (really foolish now :-), as of 
Tue Sep 15 10:58:51 PDT 1998 I would rate likelihoods
(from most to least probable):

 1. very hard takeoff with fine-grained distribution;
 2. no Singularity because we never figure out how to get
    beyond software engineering and we fail to manage complexity;
 3. IA  (tied in likelihood with:) 4. Metaman
 5. ...

The Human Memeome Project,

This might be a good place to start for memetic engineers.  Use data
mining on the net to gather replicating ideas and identify allies. 
Without AI, a lot of the meme pool would be missed, but maybe a lot of
them could be found with simple algorithms.  Who knows until you try
it.  It's not like were trying to capture all ideas ever born, just
those that are currently replicating.

The biggest problem is excluding the right sites in order to make "The
Net Memeome Project" representative of "The Human Memeome Project".  I
would start with excluding commercial and most adult sites.

The more I think about it, the more I think this is a pretty far
fetched idea (I'm good at those).  At the same time, I think the right
person could do something useful with it.

O.K. Uncle.  It seems I was mistaken in my attempt to create a 
focused discussion on singularity by focusing on Vinge's concept
and analysis.  I incorrectly assumed that Vinge had in mind a specific 
enough concept of and analysis of singularity to hold discussants' 
attention.  In fact, by "singularity" Vinge seems to just mean 
"big changes will come when we get superhumans."  And while Vinge
has dramatic opinions about how soon this will happen and how fast
those changes will come afterward, these opinions are not part of 
his concept of "singularity", and he is not willing to elaborate
on or defend them.  

This seems analogous to Eric Drexler, who written extensively on 
nanotech, and privately expressed dramatic opinions about how soon 
nanotech will come and how fast change will then be, but who
has not to my knowledge publicly defended these opinions.

The concept of Arcology fits well with my current
pet theory of intelligence. My current theory
being that the majority of "intelligent" features
happen *between* brains rather than in them. In
this sense, Soleri's social "organisms" would be
the perfect way to create a more advanced society.
Certainly the idea that crowding can be a good
thing appeals to me, if only for the irony.

The problem is they create the BIG RED LIGHT of
pseudo-scientific nonsense. If he presented the
same ideas in terms of science and engineering I'd
be more comfortable reading them.

I have since read a large majority of the material
available on his web site and I think you're
correct. He takes great pains to describe what he
means by "religion" and "spiritual" which is more
than can be said for most. He uses the term
"spirit" to talk about a connection with the past.
For instance, the sun has a spiritual value (it's
common to say "energy" but I refuse) because it
was (and is) the "life-giver". I'm not sure, but I
have a feeling that this is the correct use of the
word and the modern use (which refers to all sorts
of nonsense) is flat wrong. (You can easily see
where "spirit" as connection to the past could
have become "spirit" as ghost.) If, for example, I
made a crude joke about the holocaust it's likely
I would be flamed. That is a connection to the
past. The crucifix has spiritual value because of
its (apparent) connection to the suffering of
Jesus, and so on. I have no idea what this means,
but clearly the majority of us could be said, in
this sense, to have "spiritual" connections.
(Hands up those people who wouldn't mourn the loss
of a close friend or relative.)

This could be interesting on a cognitive level. We
seem to be able to create strong attachments to
the past, but for what reason? Emotion is normally
associated with reflex action, yet we become
emotionally "tied" to the past. It would be easy
to say the emotional attachment to memories aids
recollection, but emotions can be so strong as to
be disabling. I have a feeling something more
interesting is happening here, but I'm not sure
what. (Perhaps reason and emotion are not quite as
separate as some believe, and *not* having an
emotional attachment to the past is
counter-intuitive.)

Useful ideas can often come from strange places,
but when I hear "religion" or "spiritual" I have a
tendency to switch-off.

I'll retract the "nut" status. Eccentric, perhaps.

As a clarification I should say that I don't regard the uploading 
scenario I described as the most likely possibility. I posted it 
because I think its an interesting way of arguing for the 
singularity, not because it reflects my best guess about what will 
happen.

This would of course need to work with the cyber-punk's chameleon
suit-wear, so s/he can assume the appearance of any ethnic group to
avoid unwanted reactions due to es/ex factor considerations.

One concept that I developed in my minds eye upon reading much of Vinge's
work is that a 'singularity' is not a destination, but the horizon of any
man's vision of the future. While extrapolating from Moore's Law we think
that the event horizon of the 'singularity' is going to come closer and
closer as we approach a given point that seems now to be incomprehensible.
However, given that amplification of our own intelligence is an effect of
approaching the singularity, our own ability to imagine future
possibilities should also expand with our own intelligence.

For example, I and others on this list can imagine greater things in store
for humanity in the future than the average broom pusher or the average
tribal bushman. I am sure that to at least some humans on this planet, our
internet civilization we are building here is superhumanly
incomprehensible, while we would look at those people as savages, living a
near-animal existence. To them, we are already beyond the singularity
event horizon as they see it.

To those individuals participating in the bleeding edge techno-culture,
anyone less technological is a savage, while the 'superhuman' is never in
existence, as it is always 'todays' ideal for improvement. I'll make a
stab at a chart to illustrate this:


|                                                | |

|                                               |  |s

|                                            /     |n
                                             THE

                 savage
|                                     /            |l

animal                                           |
--------                      |r

----------0-----------                                  |i
                      ---------                |

            -------

          /                                        |
        /                                          |
      /                                            |
where: x axis is time relative to the observers present
and y axis is advancement.
As the absolute level of advancement of the observer rises, the 's' curve
contracts, but the observer always considers themselves to be 'human', and
their own ability to see further up the curve expands to counteract the
contraction of the 's' curve. This might also help in the opposite
direction. As we can see further up the curve and still consider occupants
of that advanced level of the curve to be 'human' compared to us, we might
also expand our vision DOWN the curve to consider even more primitive
forms of life as 'human', provided there is some means of communication
that can be attained.

The singularity is ALWAYS in the future. It will NEVER be reached. And
just as today there are savages and spacemen living on the same planet,
there will also be a whole panoply of civilizations within each nation or
ethnic group that at some point will be incomprehensible to each other.
This is the 'generation gap' in the extreme, though it is not necessarily
a matter of the age of the participants, but in the version numbers of the
participant's operating systems. As Moore's Law begins to contract, anyone
more than x number of software generations behind the curve will find
themselves in a state of career and cultural obsolescence, as far as the
bleeding edge is concerned.

Do not feel bad, though, as there will always be niches and reservations
and uses for individuals of all levels, just as there are niches for
savages within our own culture.

I don't think so. Since sex/reproduction is the prime motivator for the
vast majority of humanity, leaving it out is stupid, puritanical and
disingenuous.

You are basically wanting to catalogue an index for a super-search engine.

If you consider the emergence of SI to be [the beginning of]
the Singularity, then it will be a real event at a certain (fixed) point
in time, for example 30 years from now. This is imo a more useful
definition.

Maybe, but we are all still the same species. Though there is a large knowledge
gap, we still share all the basic traits that make us human. The SIs on the
other hand will be like a completely alien life form.

Hmm, I'm not so sure.

I'm now considering the singularity to be more like a recursive insight.
A couple of examples may help describe what I mean. I live on a wild coast
of forest, farm and surf beach country and often rode horses with the local
hunt club. We had to chase after an aniseed bag in a drag hunt because
there is no longer any wild game here. During a hunt there are always groups
of horses that pull away from the rest, then there's the main bunch and
after them the group that can't jump go through the gates and then there's
the people on foot. At certain times it becomes social to partake of the
spirit cup and that's when almost everyone catches up, even the people
on foot took short cuts. And then it was off again. Those who rode at the
head of the main bunch and tried in vain fits and starts to play leap frog
with the leaders seemed to cause the most damage by egging on their timid
followers and they were always the most physically exhausted. I know.
<P>My second example is more surprising because it portrays a change in
the vernacular, (like when the illiterati started to call computers 'hard
drives'.) Last night I got a call from a friend of a friend who said his
computer needs programming and could I help. After a few questions I determined
that this fellow mortgaged his house and now owns a PC, way better than
one I've ever seen. I told him that his computer didn't need programming
but quickly realized that he did. His problem was that he was overwhelmed
by too much unfamiliarity and in every real sense it was his brain that
needed programming not the computer. Educators take note: I don't mean
book learning but actual hands on programming like flows to subroutines
and calls to peripheral drivers, etc.
<P>I just hope that the old adage of "the more things change the more they
stay the same" will help humanity overcome the lizard strategy of wriggling
away from an attack and leaving its tail behind.

Undoubtedly this is why they refer to us by such awe-struck terms of
worship as `geek' and `nerd'.  :)

Here is a strange idea I had.  We have been talking about duplicating
all of a person's thoughts into an upload as a means to recreate a
person.  Ignoring the discussion of whether it transfers or copies an
individual, I think we all agree that it creates an individual that is
very similar to the original.

Now, to copy me, I assume that we have to read my thoughts and
memories.  My desires, memories, goals, etc., must not only be read and
duplicated, but I think they must be decipherable and interpreted.

Now, suppose that I am cryogenically frozen and brought back in the
future.  They may have scanned my entire mind and recreated my thought
processes into a new body for me.  What about my family members who were
not recorded, stored and recreated?  They are gone and lost forever.

But, I have memories of them.  What they looked like, how they acted,
what they said, how they lived.  What if all the known data about a
family member is also read out of my mind, and used to recreate that
family member?  It wouldn't be a true representation, but it would be a
recreation of my perception of them.  If the recreation looked the same,
spoke the same, acted the same, generated the same kinds of reactions
and conversations, I probably couldn't tell the difference.  As far as I
would know, that person would have been recreated.

To carry the idea further, what if they gather information about this
person from many different people?  Each person would have a different
perspective than me, and would have different data that I wouldn't
know.  The resulting recreation would be an individual that would fool
all of us into thinking it was just like the original person.  The
recreation would have data from all of us, so it could still tell each
of us things we didn't know about it.  It might even be able to
synthesize data together and come up with conclusions about itself that
nobody else knew, because none of us had the complete picture.

Such a person would be a perfect recreation, as far as any outside
observer could tell.  Families might be able to recreate lost members
who did not survive.  Such a recreation would not know the original's
secret fantasies, desires, or fears.  Anything hidden by the original
would be lacking in the recreation.  The recreation would be of the

Any comments about this method of recreating people?  It wouldn't meet
my definition of survival.  But it might be interesting to create a new
person to replace a lost person.

I also think excluding commercial and adult sites would be counter productive.
Commercial and adult sites can function as sources and channels for memes
just as can academic or organizational sites.  We should also be aware 
of the impact that sexually explicit video tapes had on the early video
market.  And I have read that today many of the sites that are doing a lot
of work with online video are sexually explicit sites.  Think of the 
information that would be lost if the Human Genome Project wanted to
exclude genes related to sex.

A meme is a meme, document and collect any and all that you want.  Someone
will probably get some of the ones you miss.

At this point I should make a profound point about Bartley and PCR, but I
am have a busy day tomorrow so I will leave that point for someone else.

Actually, what I'm doing is non-cyberpunk, a kind of techno-political
thriller. But since most characters are definitely going to be using
wearables and translation programs, the ethnic modules might be a good
idea. Just look out for crucified santas :-)

I'll second that. And to further Fredrick C. Multon's comment:
<P>"I also think excluding commercial and adult sites would be counter

<P>I disagree and say that their use on the implementation scale is well
down the track. First, you need to refine the network using the linguistic
parsers of Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF). The predictability of the
net can be verified to within human limits. Then the patterns of the patterns
are found and morphed to the ever changing netherland of the commercial
and adult sites. I wouldn't rule out any parallel run but I know I could
build semantic repertory grids using Ingrid if I had access like the AI
in the book Exegesis. This can be verified by the public using the first
public AI.
<P>Now I know I could be really hunting for contact if I were to try to
linguistically parse purposeful cockney rhyming slang, because these methods
only work for those in the know. However by using a lexical parser that
returned eigenvalues I bet anybody that Ingrid would be in the know. For
these reasons I would carefully select for upfront knowledge that was easily
verified as having been produced by an AI.
<P>By all means bring on the intelligent parsers of commercial and adult
sites when available. For all I know this applied research may have already
been done. For all I know the AI systems are already in place. &lt;sigh>If
not all I need is $2000 to buy 3x8 PCI strong(ARM) processors to go inside
my PC.&lt;/sigh> Then&nbsp; I can make an Ingrid processor using only large
integers that just might be able to handle any stream of consciousness
that you could throw at it via MS-DOS 5.0. But I would go where the meaning
is already easy to get at and not obscure or coercive.</HTML>

This topic is actually examined, to some extent, in James Halperin's novel
The First Immortal.  As for my comments, it seems possible but it also
seems to require a level of understanding of the brain that would enable
us to create SIs, thus destroying society as we know it.  That's the
problem with most really advanced technologies.

Humanity could be the first SI (that we know of). Humanity
has developed superior heuristics (scientific method), memory
capabilities (writing, information storage), information
processing speed (language, Internet), and data gathering (any
instrument of science).

The scientific community can be thought of as one massive
parallel computer to work on a vast number of issues simultaneously.
Guided by the rigorous (most of the times, that is) application
of the scientific method, the scientific community constantly
diagnosis its current knowledge base. The scientific community
constantly shifts resources to problems that are more complicated
and/or hold greater promise than others.

The AI and SI movements can be viewed as attempts to create more
efficient and robust nodes within the neural net of the scientific
community. Take that costly human physicist who works only 15 hours
a day and suffers from rigid heuristics after a few decades and 
replace him/her with a tireless research operating at superior
speeds and malleable heuristics.

The central idea behind my post regarding the ultimate potential
of SIs and HIs is to analyze the "unknowability" and
"incomprehensibility" traits used by some to describe a post-
Singularity environment. Using the "weak SI" and "strong SI"
distinctions Nick mentioned, if the post-Singularity universe is
populated by weak SIs then it will be comprehensible to us. If it
is populated by strong SIs then it will be incomprehensible.

The question of whether SIs will be "strong" or "weak" does not
appear to be a question of SI capabilities but instead should be
an inquiry into the nature of knowledge. Is there knowledge to be
had that is forever beyond the grasp of human intelligence (even
amplified HI)? Its a epistemological question which I doubt can
be resolved easily. Such knowledge would be beyond our abilities
of recognition, inference, deduction and modelling. We can not
speculate on the feasibility of the existence of such knowledge
since, by definition, we can not appreciate the validity of the
knowledge. Why should we assume such knowledge exists except out
of some ill-advised attempt at anthropic humility? 

If a SI is a strong/qualitative SI then it will be able to access
these areas of knowledge that HIs can not. This type of situation
parallels the turbo dog brain example Nick described. HI is
qualitatively superior to >DI because of HI abilities of cognition,
deduction, modelling, inference, etc. However, if we modified the
>DI's software then it might achieve HI levels. If a SI is only
a weak/quantitative SI then it might think faster and more
efficiently, but it would not be able to access those areas of
knowledge unknowable to HIs. The weak/quantitatively-superior SI
would reach milestones faster but it would not reach more milestones
overall.

The Knowledge Question raises an interesting issue. Even if 
Strong SIs existed, how would we properly recognize them as Strong
SIs? Since the knowledge they accessed that heralded their 
ascension to Strong SI status is beyond our ability to appreciate, 
how could we distinguish between a Strong SI and a Weak SI that 
has lost its marbles? When faced with such a choice it appears 
that our only guidance becomes the faith we have in the SI. Either
we say, "Gee, what the SI is doing now is completely beyond me.
Since its a SI, it probably knows what its doing. Its a Strong SI" 
or we say, "This thing has gone nuts." Another problem is 
differentiating between knowledge that is forever beyond us and 
knowledge that is beyond us for now but will be understandable 
after another 200 years of scientific work.

Good short story, anyway - mine.  `Resurrection', *Asimov's*, Aug 1984.
Has an SI AI, for good measure.

And Halperin did something similar recently with one character in THE LAST
IMMORTAL.

Martin Jarvis of the British Antarctic Survey has authored a report 
published in the September issue of the Journal of 
Geophysics--Atmosphere regarding his team's findings based on tracking 
the fluctuations of the ionosphere.  They think that the outer boundary 
of the thermosphere, which rises and falls daily, has gone into a 
long-term retreat of five miles closer to the earth.

I am sure that you can find at least an abstract of the article on the 
journal website, but the traffic has been heavy this morning and I 
could not get through myself.

 I totally agree with that view. The image of the horizon is just the
right thing: everybody is on the verge of a singularity, we're
constantly walking toward it! And there might not be just one horizon,
but a continuity of them, in every domain of humanity's knowledge or
ability.

  To think there will be a change, any sort of change, be it
philosophical, economical, social, technical...etc, to the very
history of mankind, a change that is actually the end of history,
looks very much like a doom theory. Well, it could/will look like it
to a lot of people. Me included? Certainly, if I or my offsprings
(genetically or not) are not part of it, and/or if it happens very
quickly/violently.

   When was the last time when the end of history was announced? Karl
Marx. (note: I don't want to imply that communism is linked in anyway
with the singularity, just want to draw an analogy)

    Manu.

This century has already seen the births of the nuclear revolution, 
the plastics revolution, the transistor revolution, the integrated circuit 
revolution, the television revolution, the computer revolution, the 
genetics revolution, the laser revolution, the robot revolution, the 
nano revolution, the space travel revolution, etc., etc....the changes 
still ahead of us seem mainly to be a matter of degree rather than 
essence.  Could it be that we have been in the singularity for a while 
now, and are on the down side of the bell curve, the rest now being 
a matter of refinements?

 Mind reading might not be a requirement for a very good copy of some peoples
minds. Authors have been placing their thoughts in the public domain for years.
Coupling that knowledge with their celebrity ( book signings, speaking
engagements, tv interviews, etc) many diverse people would have direct contact
with popular authors and could give useful feedback on personality traits. As to
which authors one might choose to resurect, two spring to mind that might have
personalities that would easily accept their unique state as resurected mosaics.
Dr. Asimov and what , to me is quite fitting, considering his Methusela's
Children stories, Robert Heinlein.

Eliezer S. Yudkowsky seems to be the only person here willing to defend 
"explosive growth," by which I mean sudden very rapid world economic growth. 
So I'd like to see what his best argument is for this.  But Eliezer, if 
we're going to make any progress, we're going to have to *focus*.   I don't 
want to wander off on a dozen irrelevant tangents.

So first, please make clear which (if any) other intelligence growth
processes you will accept as relevant analogies.  These include the evolution of 
the biosphere, recent world economic growth, human and animal learning, the 
adaptation of corporations to new environments, the growth of cities, the
domestication of animals, scientific progress, AI research progress, advances
in computer hardware, or the experience of specific computer learning programs.  

You seemed to say no analogies are relevant, and then your last response to me
touches on AI, learning general relativity, Cro-Magnons, Lamarkian biology, 
the rise of cities, and many other topics.   I don't want to talk about these 
things if they are tangential to your argument.

If no analogies are relevant, and so this is all theory driven, can the theory
be stated concisely?  If not, where did you get the theory you use?  Does 
anyone else use it, and what can be its empirical support, if analogies are 
irrelevant?

It *doesn't* exist, I was making a proposal to create the "Human
Memeome Project".  Also, If you don't exclude adult sites, your data
mining effort will conclude that the most popular of all human memes
is "free nude teen pics".  The next 100 down the list will be similar.
 There is plenty of adult information in personal web sites and I
believe that to be more representative of a human individual than
people looking to make a quick buck.  Those sites represent someone's
effort to influence others to spend, not someone's effort to publish
their personal memes on the web.

No, lets say you wanted to collect a snapshot of a specific class of
memes e.g. (idioms/buzz words/catch phrases/figures of speech).  Since
most of these phrases are between three and six words, you could start
searching for multiple matches from the greater web of every group of
three to six words you encounter on the web site that is currently
being scanned.  Certainly, you would need a super-search engine as a
tool to accomplish this.  But the output would be a list of catch
phrases that are common in the meme pool.

Considering that we are heading for 6 billion souls on this planet, it seems
to me that that estimate is right on. 'nude teens' may be the most popular
meme that is running through peoples minds.

No you don't need to use a search engine. Since search engines already run
off of indexes, you use the indexes to do an incidence count of  how
frequently any word occurs within 3 words of any other word, as well as the
most frequent word sequences. You then create a search engine that runs off
of your new 'catch phrase' index to provide meme searching capability.

I object to the implication that I'm fighting a lone cause.  The key word is
_here_.  There are many others, not-surprisingly including AIers (like
Moravec), and nanotechnologists (like Drexler), and others who actually deal
in the technology of transcendence, who are also Strong Singularitarians.  In
fact, I can't think offhand of a major SI-technologist who's heard of the
Strong Singularity but prefers the Soft.

> "explosive growth," by which I mean sudden very rapid world economic growth.

I don't know or care about "very rapid world economic growth".  I think that
specific, concrete things will happen, i.e. the creation of superintelligence
operating at a billion times a human's raw power, because that kind of power
is easily achievable with technologies (quantum computing, nanotech) that can
be envisioned right now, and to which the only theoretical barrier is our
currently inadequate intelligence to solve certain problems (theoretical
physics, molecular engineering, protein folding).  I think the trigger will be
transhumans (of neurotech or silicate) who can either solve the problems or
rapidly design the next generation.

You can call that "explosive growth", if you want.  You can describe this
however you like, using any analogies you like, and it won't make a difference
whether the "analogies" are to the rise of Cro-Magnons or the introduction of
the printing press.  The actual event will not be driven by analogies.  It
will be driven by the concrete facts of cognitive science and
fast-infrastructure technology.

> So I'd like to see what his best argument is for this.

Arguments AGAINST a Singularity generally use the following assumptions:

* 20th-century humans live at the maximum attainable rate of change.
* Some given piece of technology (such as nanotechnology) is impossible,
despite it having already been implemented in nature.  (All other technologies
with the same capabilities, whether or not the speaker has foreseen them, are
also impossible by association.)
* Some set of extremely high-level properties are absolutely unalterable OR
* Some properties as they exist in 20th-century humans (and as improved over
those obtaining in earlier centuries) are perfectly optimal from an SI perspective.
* The "fact" that SIs are Turing-computable means that humans can understand
them by simulating them.  (If a trained immortal chimpanzee simulated your
brain by hand, could he understand your thoughts?  And why couldn't Aristotle
use this same argument to predict the 20th century?)
* It is impossible for an intelligence to create its successor.  (The Argument
>From Descartes's Silly Theology.)

(The phrase "20th-century humans" is used when the same would not apply to
"19th-century humans".)

Arguments FOR a Singularity usually require some, but not all, of the
following assumptions:

* 20th-century humans do not achieve the same maximum quality of intelligence
possible with unlimited processing power.
* It is possible to duplicate or exceed the processing power of the human
brain using technology, and then to code an AI.
* It is possible to write software which exceeds human intelligence using less
computing power, at least in the domain of computer design or efficient software.
* There exists at least one fast-infrastructure technology, such as
nanotechnology, which is capable of manufacturing massive computer power in a
short time.
* Intelligence above a certain level can rapidly improve itself or design a
successor, using self-sustaining increments of optimization or fast infrastructure.
* It is possible to use neurosurgery or genetic engineering to enhance human
intelligence, either generally or in a specialty.
* It is possible to integrate a human brain with computer processors.
* It is possible to run a human brain, or a community of brains, using faster
processors.  (The nanotech/upload "if all else fails" argument.)

(Many of these arguments are technical, rather than philosophical, which is as
it should be.)

The following arguments AGAINST a Strong Singularity have no visible flaws,
and I have no arguments against them.

* Humanity will obliterate itself with nuclear war or nanowar.
* Any SI commits suicide.
* Any SI escapes from the Universe.
* Game theory requires that SIs treat us with kid gloves.
* Unlimited computing power preserves all patterns, including ours.

CONCLUSION:  Assuming that none of the above are true, I believe that a Strong
Singularity is the most likely result.

None, of course.  I wrote "Coding a Transhuman AI"; I don't need to reason
from analogies.  There aren't many positive statements I can make thereby, but
I can find definite flaws in other people's simulations.  My theory has
advanced enough to disprove, but not to prove - and personally, I find nothing
wrong with that.  A scientist doesn't have a Grand Ultimate Theory of
Everything, but he can easily disprove the deranged babblings of crackpots. 
It is only the philosophers who attempt the proofs before establishing
disproofs, and come to think of it, it's mainly philosophers who argue by
analogy, starting with the arch-traitor Plato.  Some of the things that get
disproved by obvious flaws are all of the analogies listed above.

My theory does not disprove Moravecian leakage, SI suicide, nuclear war, or
nanowar (or the SI obliteration of humanity), and therefore I frame no
hypothesis concerning these events.  Years ago I had "proofs" that some such
unpleasant things were impossible, and some of my best theories rose from the
methods I used to tear these treasured proofs to shreds.  There are many
unpleasant things for which I have no disproof, but the wonderfully pleasant
vision of a slow, humanly-understandable, material-omnipotence,
chicken-in-every-pot UnSingular scenario is both impossible and unimaginative
and that is that.

When was there ever a point when the large-scale future could be predicted by
analogy with the past?  Could Cro-Magnons be predicted by extrapolating from
Neanderthals?  (And would the Neanderthals have sagely pointed out that no
matter how intelligent a superneanderthal is, there are still only so many
bananas to pick?)  I am not saying that the rise of superintelligence is
analogous to the rise of Cro-Magnons; I am saying that reasoning by analogy is
worthless.  The analogies that argue for the Singularity, no less than the
analogies that argue against it.  The argument from Moore's Law is specious,
unless you're a researcher in computing techniques who can describe exactly
how a given level is achievable, in which case Moore's Law is the default
assumption for time frames.

The _hypothesis_ can be stated concisely:  Transhuman intelligence will move
through a very fast trajectory from O(5X) human intelligence to nanotechnology
and billions of times human intelligence.  The valid reasons for believing
this to be the most probable hypothesis are accessible only through technical
knowledge, as is usually the case.

I can't visualize nanotechnology, but I take Drexler's word that it allows
very high computing power, and I am given to understand that solving a set of
research problems is sufficient to use a standard (current-tech)
DNA-to-protein synthesizer or STM (there's one accessible from the Internet)
to produce the basic replicator.  I can visualize cognitive science and AI,
and I say that human intelligence can be improved by adding neurons to search
processes, and that the transcend point of an AI is architectural design, and
both require Manhattan projects but are still within reach.

I suspect that successful SIs who are still interfacing with humans will
convey attributes and messages which elicit human trust, just like petting
the dog conveys to the dog that you are friendly and trustworthy. And, just
as we don't discuss the Extropian Principles with our pets, I doubt that
the SIs will bother us with things they know we can't understand.....

Give the man a cigar. (Applause.)

Actually, I've been nursing a couple of hypotheses for a while now, which
bear on the idea of a different kind of singularity (and are probably 
politically incorrect in such a primarily-libertarian list as this, but 
that's another matter).

Consider Linux. Not as an operating system, but as a paradigm for an
economic singularity that lies no further in the future than the first
replicator.

It used to be the case that if I owned an artefact, and gave it to
someone else, I no longer owned that artefact. Today, though, software
and data have become weirdly delocalized. I can own a computer program
and give you a copy of it, and still have all the benefits of owning it
myself.

Our existing legal framework for coping with intellectual property is
derived from two platforms; copyright and patent law. Copyright was
introduced because the effects of _not_ restricting the ownership of
copying rights to the originator of a work were damaging the ability
of those originators to support themselves, producing more work; thus,
it was a useful legal fiction in the 19th century. It was effectively 
enforcable because printing presses were great clanking monsters; you
couldn't violate someone else's copyright on a commercial scale without 
being fairly easy to track down.

Patents were a secondary form of intellectual protection. Granted
effectively by state fiat, for the purpose of encouraging inventiveness
in the national interest, they granted a de-facto monopoly over the
exploitation of a new technique.

Now, the copyright concept seems to me to no longer be enforcable in the
same way that it was in, say, 1850. Moreover, the whole concept has been
extended in directions that were never initially intended. It doesn't
make _sense_ to assert copyright control over something that is
infinitely copyable; if you invent something that falls into this 
category, there are any number of alternative business models possible
to ensure that you receive remuneration without trying to enforce the
unenforcable. (Try providing telephone support on a subscription basis,
for example. See the recent [entertaining] piece on usenet comparing
Microsoft's support hotline to the Psychic Friends Network, for example,
then look at SuSE, Red Hat, Caldera, and the other people making money 
out of Linux.)

The whole free software idea, which Richard Stallman's been banging on
about for the best part of twenty years, is finally going somewhere --
and if _anything_ can push Bill Gates out of the #1 spot, it's a
competitor with the right price (zero) which he can't buy up and
can't undersell. 

This isn't the place for a lecture on the economics of open source software;
if you want one, Eric Raymond and others have written more eloquently about
it than I. Let's just say it's a potlach economy. There's enough of everything
for even the most gluttonous consumer because consumption does not involve
sequestration; however your personal prestige is proportional to the amount 
you contribute to the pool. (And we shouldn't discount such things as
economically irrelevent -- after all, economics is at one level a description
of the interactions of human beings; and human beings, being great apes,
have a whole load of tribal dominance and position stuff wired into their
brains: ignoring the fact that humans sometimes do things because it 
affirms their sense of their position in the tribe is not clever when
one is trying to analyse human behaviour.)

Now start thinking about the implications of the open source ethos for
molecular nanotechnology.

It's probably premature to start expecting this for at least another
couple of years, but I'm wondering about the prospects of a 'Free
Hardware Foundation' arising fairly rapidly. Such a hypothetical
non-organisation will apply the same principles the FSF applies to
software to the design of basic living equipment that can be
manufactured using whatever replicator technology comes along. 

The idea that 'information wants to be free' has a direct metaphor:
'access to tools'. If the cost of manufacturing any physical artefact
for which a design exists is brought down to cost of raw materials plus
energy, then exactly the same problem of copying control that currently
applies to software will apply to all tangible goods. (A case can be
made for excluding objets'd'art, but, as they say, you can't eat
handicrafts.)

In which case, of course, we have an economic singularity. Suddenly, the
contemporary motivations for production become wholly obsolete -- anyone
can have all the information or physical goods they can carry, whenever
they want them! Because, if you ask me to give you my car, I can do so
and immediately run off another copy of GNU Automobile 20.4 (with the
combined cycle gas turbine and fuel cells and solar panels, eight wheels
and two tracks -- driver's seat and steering wheel optional extras). Which
was designed by enthusiasts because Ford and GM were designing and selling
the automotive equivalent of Windows 95 -- a glossy but technically
inferior and inefficient, unreliable product that is then sold on an
insupportable basis.

Lest anyone suggest that this can't happen, I'd like to point to the FSF
and the whole Linux phenomenon as an existence proof for information-based
potlach economies that can agressively gain market share even in the face of 
determined opposition by an entrenched industry structured along conventional
free-market lines.

Any opinions?

Makes complete sense to me though I forsee short term problems associated with
the initial tool sets (no corperate/govermental entity is going to want to hand
them out).
On the other hand given the nature of the beast preventing proliferation is
likely not possable and I'm sure hacking reality will be even more enticeing
than hacking computers.
In fact, for the majority, this is this is probably the only way _we'll_ get
direct access to the tech

The idea that 'information wants to be free' has a direct metaphor:
'access to tools'. If the cost of manufacturing any physical artefact
for which a design exists is brought down to cost of raw materials plus
energy, then exactly the same problem of copying control that currently
applies to software will apply to all tangible goods. (A case can be
made for excluding objets'd'art, but, as they say, you can't eat
handicrafts.)

In which case, of course, we have an economic singularity. Suddenly, the
contemporary motivations for production become wholly obsolete -- anyone
can have all the information or physical goods they can carry, whenever
they want them! Because, if you ask me to give you my car, I can do so
and immediately run off another copy of GNU Automobile 20.4 (with the
combined cycle gas turbine and fuel cells and solar panels, eight wheels
and two tracks -- driver's seat and steering wheel optional extras). Which
was designed by enthusiasts because Ford and GM were designing and selling
the automotive equivalent of Windows 95 -- a glossy but technically
inferior and inefficient, unreliable product that is then sold on an
insupportable basis.

Lest anyone suggest that this can't happen, I'd like to point to the FSF
and the whole Linux phenomenon as an existence proof for information-based
potlach economies that can agressively gain market share even in the face of 
determined opposition by an entrenched industry structured along conventional
free-market lines.

Any opinions?

Is it clear they mean the same thing by "strong singularity"?  And if so many 
people agree, why can I find no published (i.e., subject to editorial review)
coherent analysis in favor of explosive growth?

But it's not clear what "X times human power" means.  We already have machines 
this much faster than humans at arithmetic.  It seems to me that the important
measure of intelligence is its ability to solve real problems, and the natural
measure of this is the income such thinkers can command.  If you reject this,
you need to propose some substitute.

Even if you do this, there is also the question of *when* you say this will 
happen.  Most people would accept it may happen within a billion
years, but you seem to be saying more.  Economic growth rates seem to me a 
natural "when" measure, but if you reject this, you need a substitute.

I think you will find I have sufficient technical background to understand

Copyright was introduced to protect the profits of publishers, not
originators, although that justification was later used.  See
"Intellectual Property: A Non-Posnerian Law and Economics Approach"

I feel that the property status of information will be the single
greatest non-engineering factor in shaping societies of the next
century.  If we continue down the path of increasing property
protections for information we will likely have a society run by
state/corporate cartels with huge disparities of wealth between
information owners and non-owners and a very boring culture.

However, I feel that anything qualifying as a "singularity" will
be engineering-driven.  Nanotech implies drastic changes irregardless
of the property regime it occurs in, short of a totalitarian one
that could completely control access to the technology.

Eliezer's model seems to be that the doubling time of computer hardware 
efficiency is proportional to the computer operations per second devoted 
to R&D in computer hardware, or within all of computer-aided "humanity."  
(I'm not clear which Eliezer intends.)

The "all of humanity" model has the problem that computer hardware wasn't
improving at all for a long time while humanity increased greatly in 
size.  And while humanity has tripled since 1930, computer hardware 
doubling times have tracked this increase.  It is also not clear why 
animal and other biological computation is excluded from this model. 

The "within computer hardware R&D" model has the problem that over the 
last half century doubling times have not increased in proportion to the 
number of people doing computer hardware R&D.  (Anyone have figures on
this?)  Furthermore, is it plausible that the near zero doubling times of
~1700 could have been much improved by putting lots of people into 
computer R&D then?  And if we next year doubled the number of people doing 
computer R&D, I don't think we'd expect a doubling of the hardware 
doubling time. 

It is not at all clear what Eliezer thinks "quality" improvements scale as,
so there isn't much on this issue to discuss.

We've been here before.  "Constant, unenhanced minds"?  Programs which can
help layout a chip's design, and simulate the operation of that design before
it is built, are a big enhancement.  I build chip C0 and use it to design the
faster C1 which helps me design the faster C2 and so on...

Irrelevant to the grand total of intelligence, perhaps.  Not irrelevant to the
above loop; I don't think we could build current chips without their
predecessors.  Not in two years at least, and possibly not at all if keeping
track of a PPro's design would exceed a human's attention span, even with the
help of lots of paper.  (An important cognitive enhancement.)

The thing about all that human intelligence is that most of it is not being
applied to the specific fields where computers are relevant, so comparing
total computing to total human thought is misleading.  Most human intelligence
is supporting the overhead of being human -- visual and auditory processing,
including peripheral and background processing looking out for the unexpected;
language processing; the ability to toss crumpled paper into the wastebasket
from odd angles; surviving office politics; and so on.

I don't know how to do it myself, but it'd be interesting to estimate how the
thought an Intel engineer can actually commit to chip design compares with the
power of the chip (or chips) he is currently using.

Crude model: the mortal brain comes up with scenarios, evaluates them, and
remembers them.  The paper-enhanced brain uses external memory, freeing part
of itself for more creativity and criticism, and allowing larger and more
accurate storage than would otherwise be possible.  The modern brain uses
computers to evaluate more complex scenarios than otherwise possible, with
superhuman speed and accuracy (and similar advances in memory), freeing the
brain to just come up with ideas.  The next step is obvious.  But would it be
explosive, as opposed to exponential?  I don't see why.

That section of "Staring Into the Singularity" (which Hanson quoted) was
intended as an introduction/illustration of explosive growth and positive
feedback, not a technical argument in favor of it.  As an actual scenario,
"Recursive Moore's Law" does not describe a plausible situation, because the
infinite continuation of the eighteen-month doubling time is not justified,
nor is the assumption that AIs have exactly the same abilities and the same
doubling time.  Above all, the scenario completely ignores three issues: 
Nanotechnology, quantum computing, and increases in intelligence rather than
mere speed.  This is what I meant by a "pessimistic projection".  Actual
analysis of the trajectory suggests that there are several sharp spikes
(nanotechnology, quantum computing, self-optimization curves), more than
sufficient to disrupt the world in which Moore's Law is grounded.

So what good was the scenario?  Like the nanotech/uploading argument, it's a
least-case argument.  Would you accept that in a million years, or a billion
years, the world would look to _us_ like it'd gone through a Strong
Singularity?  Just in terms of unknowability, not in terms of speed?  Well, in
that case, you're saying:  "I believe it's possible, but I think it will
happen at a speed I'm comfortable with, one that fits my visualization of the
human progress curve."

The scenario above points out (via the old standby of "It's a billion years of
subjective time!") that once you have AIs that can influence the speed of
progress (or uploaded humans, or neurotech Specialists, or any other
improvement to intelligence or speed) you are no longer dealing with the
_human_ progress curve.  More than that, you're dealing with positive
feedback.  Once intelligence can be enhanced by technology, the rate of
progress in technology is a function of how far you've already gone.  Any
person whose field deals with positive feedback in any shape or form, from
sexual-selection evolutionary biologists to marketers of competing standards,
will tell you that positive feedback vastly speeds things up, and tends to
cause them to swing to "unreasonable" extremes.

Some of the things Hanson challenges me to support/define have already been
defined/supported in the sections of "Human AI to transhuman" which I have
posted to this mailing list - as stated, a "supporting increment" of progress
is one which supports further progress, both in terms of self-optimization
freeing up power for additional optimizing ability, and in terms of new CPU
technologies creating the intelligence to design new CPU technologies.  The
rest of the assertions I can defend or define are also in that thread
(including "short time", "rapidly", and "self-sustaining").

But I can't tell you anything about nanotechnology or quantum computing - not
more than the good amateur's grasp we all have.  I do not consider myself an
authority on these areas.  I concern myself strictly with the achievement of
transhuman or nonhuman intelligence, with the major technical background in
computer programming and a secondary background in cognitive science.  I am
assured of the existence of fast infrastructures by Dr. Drexler, who has a
Ph.D. in nanotechnology and understands all the molecular physics.  If in turn
Dr. Drexler should happen to worry about our ability to program such fast
computers, I would assure him that such things seem more probable to me than
nanotechnology.  I don't know of anyone who Knows It All well enough to
project the full power/intelligence/speed curve, but the technical experts
seem to think that their particular discipline will not fail in its task.

What I can tell you is this:  Given an amount of computing power equivalent to
the human brain, I think that I - with the assistance of a Manhattan Project -
could have an intelligence of transhuman technological and scientific
capabilities running on that power inside of five years.  (This is not to say
that _only_ I could do such a thing, simply that I am speaking for myself and
of my own knowledge - my projection is not based on a hopeful assessment of
someone else's abilities.)  I can also tell you, from my amateur's grasp of
fast infrastructures, that the Singularity would occur somewhere between one
hour and one year later.

Computing power substantially less than that of the brain would probably
double the time to ten years, but I still think I could do it given a
substantial fraction of the current Internet.  In other words, given no
technical improvement whatsoever in any field outside my own, humanity's
resources still suffice for a Singularity.  We passed the point of no return
in 1996.

Why do I believe the Singularity will happen?  Because I, personally, think I
can do it.  Again, not necessarily _only_ me, or even _mostly_ me - but I can
speak for myself and of my own knowledge.

Copyright was introduced to protect the profits of publishers, not
originators, although that justification was later used.  See
"Intellectual Property: A Non-Posnerian Law and Economics Approach"
by Tom G. Palmer in the Hamline Law Review, 1989, pp. 261-304 and
the cover story of the September Atlantic magazine on IP for
discussions of this.

I feel that the property status of information will be the single
greatest non-engineering factor in shaping societies of the next
century.  If we continue down the path of increasing property
protections for information we will likely have a society run by
state/corporate cartels with huge disparities of wealth between
information owners and non-owners and a very boring culture.

However, I feel that anything qualifying as a "singularity" will
be engineering-driven.  Nanotech implies drastic changes irregardless
of the property regime it occurs in, short of a totalitarian one
that could completely control access to the technology.

Argh.  Obviously something about mail sent from my ISP account
is causing the list to think it needs to resend several copies.

I will not post from that account any more.  Sorry for the wasted

But it was by far the most technical argument I found in your web pages on 
timing.  If I missed something more technical, please point it out.

My & Damien's critiques suggest this scenario may be greatly optimistic
on other counts.  You need to defend it against these critiques if you want
it to be accepted as a plausible lower bound on future growth rates.

If you think that post is a persuasive technical analysis on timing claims, 
rather than suggestive prose, I suspect you don't know what such analysis is, 
and so my requests for it are futile.  Does *anyone* reading this other than 
Eliezer think that Eliezer's first post constitutes such a persuasive

ONE:

1.  In the Beginning was the Singularity, but it was known to none, for men
lived in fear and squalor.

2.  Then there did come a great wave of technology, bearing man up towards the
heavens and into the heart of matter, even into the brain.

3.  And from afar off did the Singularity make itself known to man.

4.  And the Singularity did make itself known after the profession of he who
saw it.

5.  Yea, each man saw it as if he himself had invented it, and understood it
with the intuitions of long experience, and spoke of it with the words he loved.

TWO:

6.  And the Singularity did make itself known to Vinge, a mathematician, who
said:  "Verily it is self-referential, and thus unknowable; yea, it causes our
models to break down; it alters the rules so that our old theories do not apply."

7.  And the Singularity did make itself known to Drexler, a nanotechnologist,
who said:  "Material omnipotence shall be granted us; yea, even complete
control over the structure of matter, and also much computing power."  And
because Drexler worked on nanosecond and picosecond time scales, he did speak
of high-speed intelligence.

8.  And the Singularity did make itself known to Hanson, an economist, who
said:  "Verily this foolishness is unlike all the laws of economics which I
know; yea, the analogies and perceptions which I have learned dictate that it
shall proceed at a rapid but knowable pace, like all other revolutions."

9.  And the Singularity did make itself known to Yudkowsky, a cognitive
engineer, who said:  "Surely intelligence is the source of all potency and
power; verily intelligence is the breaker of rules, the wild magic.  Yea, the
Singularity shall tear down the foundations of the world."  And because he
loved intelligence, he exalted the Singularity above all other things.

10.  And the Singularity did make itself know to science fiction authors, who
had watched their work crowded off the shelves by garbage, verily dreck which
was an abomination unto the Lord; who had seen the government screw up the
space program, and great things laid low by inadequate funding.

11.  And they said:  "Surely the Singularity shall be entered by but a few,
and others shall impede them; the superintelligent shall be laid low by lack
of infrastructure."

12.  And the Singularity did make itself know to the watchers of memes, who
said:  "Verily this is like many other memes which I have known, and all of
them stupid; yea, it seemeth but another apocalypse meme."  And they waxed
mightily suspicious.

13.  And the Singularity did make itself known to Nielsen, a quantum theorist,
who did ask of many probabilities which interacted in nonlinear ways, saying: 
"The chance of a given outcome can be estimated even though it is nondeterministic."

14.  And many murmured against the writer, verily the writer of this message,
saying that he was torturing the analogy.

THREE:

15.  So the Singularity was known to many after their own prejudices, but the
whole truth was known to none.

16.  And they debated, hither and yon, saying yea and nay.

17.  Verily many had an amateur grasp of the others' fields, but each of them
placed confidence in their own field above all others.

18.  And their heart could not be swayed with words they loved not.

19.  And they are still debating.

Isn't the problem that a key term in all of these discussions, "intelligence"
(appearing in such other key terms as "human equivalence", "augmentation",
etc.), is simply not well understood at this point?  The proponents of a
"singularity" all seem to have this concept built into their basic schema of
super-acceleration in the sense that they assume that "intelligence" can be
replicated in a machine and then, once replicated, enhanced.  I'm sure that
essentially every subscriber to this list would agree with that general
assertion.  But, until this essential factor is more subject to
quantification, I doubt that analysis of the rigor you are seeking, Robin, is
possible.  That doesn't make the discussion pointless, it just makes it less
precise than we might like.

First of all, my first post is a selection of a summary of a technically
detailed speculation.  The summary of the speculation is in the "Singularity
Analysis" web page, and the speculation itself is in "Coding a Transhuman AI",
which if posted here would bring the mailing list to its knees.

As for technical analysis, if you'd like the kind of elaborate equations
beloved of economic forecasts, you're simply out of luck.  But be comforted by
the fact that such equations have never successfully predicted the course of
the human race and never will, so it is utterly absurd to extend them to superintelligence.

I suppose I could fake up an elaborate power/intelligence/speed graph, using
EURISKO's runs, past trends in computing power, the gradual drift in
intelligence, and records of economic revolutions.  But it'd be a statistical
lie (and as we know, those are even worse than damned lies).  I don't intend
to do it because I don't think it'd be honest to my readers.  I have enough
confidence in my rough models.  I shall not disguise them with impressive
mathematical uniforms they are not entitled to wear.

Spot on, IMHO.  In fact, it's the argument I made in THE SPIKE, pp. 116-9,
in the sections `Would you work without pay?' and `Potlatch beats greed'.
(It assumes, of course, that a lot of money will first be invested in
building the early mints or matter compilers - but capitalism should have
no trouble doing *that* much, since there'll be profits to made on the way
to the Titanic's glug-glug-glug.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Dear Mr. Nicoletti and Mr. Long,

Attached is an example of spam which I have been receiving from your
network.  When I inquired in the anti-spam community the general
response was that direct1.net was a spam-happy spamhaus which allows
its customers to steal computer services from innocent netizens.  Not
being one to take this at face value, I decided to check out your
website and see if there is any indication of your pro- or anti- theft
of electronic services position.  I checked your faq and other links
but could find no info other than you allow people to use their
accounts for commercial use (from the FAQ.)  Next I checked to see if
you had an abuse, spam-complaint, or fraud mail account, none of which
were to be found.

So I am writing you to ask you direct:  does direct1.net knowingly
allow and support their customers who steal electronic services via
UCE (aka spam) and act as a spamhaus or spamdrop?  

Please consider that (1) the courts have repeatedly upheld that the
right of free speech stops at the border of our property (our routers,
our networks, our servers) and (2) it is not legal for advertisers to
transfer the majority of the costs of advertisements to the carriers

Excerpt from Life Extension Report 10(7): 51-52 July 1990
 By Saul Kent

"At the age of 100 - when all but the healthiest and hardiest among us have
already died - the odds of reached 101, are only about 50/50........
<large snip>

Resistance to New Ideas

  It is thus clear that aging is the primary cause of death in medically
advanced countries such as the United States. This is as clear as the sky
is blue. To me. To most of my friends. To the readers of Life Extension
Report. And to a few other enlightened souls.
  But to most people, the idea that aging is the major cause of death has
never entered their minds. In some cases, this is because they have never
been exposed to the idea. In most cases, however it is because they are
resistant to it.
  I've had numerous experiences in which I've explained how aging causes
death to intelligent, highly educated people. To medical doctors and Ph.D.
scientists. My explanation to these people was every  bit as clear as in
this article. Even more so.
  But, as I soon found out, I might as well have been talking to a rock. Or
to a brick wall. For in each of these cases, the people, who nodded their
heads when I spoke, as if they understood what I was saying, soon made it
clear that they hadn't the foggiest notion of what I was talking about. It
was as if, they were in a hypnotic trance in which they were "forbidden" to
let in new ideas. To even let themselves experience the taste of a new
idea.

A Monumental Waste of money

  The idea that aging is our primary enemy, and that it should be the
primary enemy of medical science is new and, as a result, has not yet
penetrated the minds of the majority of Americans. As a result the money
that is seized from us each year in the form of taxes has been wasted
tremendously in the past 30 years in the pursuit of the wrong goals, under
guidance of the wrong concepts.
  The government has been spending almost all the money that's been
allocated for medical research in the pursuit of treatments for specific
diseases instead of searching for ways to slow down or reverse aging.
Billions of dollars has been wasted on research which, at best, could
provide us with only limited benefits, while very little has been spent on
interventive aging research that, if successful, would provide us with
enormous health benefits."

Copyright was introduced to protect the profits of publishers, not
originators, although that justification was later used.  See
"Intellectual Property: A Non-Posnerian Law and Economics Approach"
by Tom G. Palmer in the Hamline Law Review, 1989, pp. 261-304 and
the cover story of the September Atlantic magazine on IP for
discussions of this.

I feel that the property status of information will be the single
greatest non-engineering factor in shaping societies of the next
century.  If we continue down the path of increasing property
protections for information we will likely have a society run by
state/corporate cartels with huge disparities of wealth between
information owners and non-owners and a very boring culture.

However, I feel that anything qualifying as a "singularity" will
be engineering-driven.  Nanotech implies drastic changes irregardless
of the property regime it occurs in, short of a totalitarian one
that could completely control access to the technology.

Here's a very interesting post from CryoNet about the
relative "failure" of cryonics and how it might be
remedied. Many of the arguments also apply to
transhumanism in general.

From: Jeff Davis <jdavis@socketscience.com>
Subject: selling cryonics

     Selling Cryonics

	WARNING: the following may not be suitable for all audiences.  Proceed at
your own risk.

	On April 28th, Saul Kent offered his essay on the failure of cryonics, in
which he wrote:

"Another myth that has permeated cryonics from the beginning is that there
has never been a really good effort to promote cryonics by a professional
promoter/publicist/sales person, and that if we had the right promoter and
enough money to do the job right, there would be rapid, accelerating growth
in the movement. I contend that this is the exact opposite of the truth."

	I disagree.  No myth; truth.

	Consider.  Someone is offering for sale perfect health, perpetual youth,
and an opportunity to experience all that the future has in store, in a
society at least as good as the one we've got now, and probably much, much
better.  He hires a salesman and sends him out.  The salesman comes back,
shakes his head and say, "No one's buying."  Which of the following
possible conclusions seems most likely?

(1) The product is unsellable.
(2) The salesman's approach is inadequate.
(3) The salesman's approach is monumentally inadequate.

	When asked about his approach, the salesman says, "I tell them, ' We wait
till you die, then we flush out your blood, pump you full of anti-freeze,
freeze your corpse, inflicting some damage in the process--but no
matter--then we keep you frozen until we learn how to fix you, then we
restore you to life, youthful and healthy, and send you on your way.  So
give me a hundred grand and I'll sign you up.'"

	We begin to see the problem.  Now let me state the obvious.  The character
of the product in question is unprecedented, as is the marketing challenge.
A systematic analysis conducted according to proven methodologies of market
research (a fascinating project, possibly breaking new ground in the field
of marketing) would be really helpful.  Without it we have cocktail party
conversation. (Though real breakthroughs have been known to appear on
cocktail napkins.)

	Saul goes on:

   "... there is a long history of competent promoters, entrepreneurs and
sales people committing themselves to the growth of cryonics,..."

	 Again, I disagree, and Saul's own phrasing seems to support me,
characterizing them, largely, as a passel of hucksters.
		
	"... the slickest, most persuasive promoter I've ever met.",
	
	"... two fast-talking promoters",

one of whom Saul quotes as saying:
 	
	" I've taken care of it all. The first person will be frozen in 	a few
months on international TV with the Pope and other 	celebrities 	in
attendance. After that, Juno (the cryonics 	company) expects to be freezing
thousands of people a year, 	with the company going public right after we
freeze a Nobel-prize 	winning scientist."

	The Pope. You betcha.  He'll get the word out.  He has a long history as a
competent promoter.  And then a nobel-prize-winning scientist--yahoo!  You
can't GET a better endorsement than that.  We're talking world-class
credibility here.  Noble-prize-winning smart, and cooperative enough to die
right on schedule.  Now that's planning!  Dang! I'm impressed. How
surprised and saddened everyone must have been, when, as Saul observes,
"... none of this happened."  And the remaining cast of sales
professionals: the oil speculator, the real estate speculator, the crack
insurance salesman, the almost-governor of Texas...look, I love ya Saul,
baby, but this is no professional sales effort, it's a flippin' circus.
(Saul, don't hate me forever, you're doing a good thing, and, besides,
humor is a blessing.)

	A professional marketing plan begins with research to identify specific
market segments, and a sales strategy tailored to each segment,  some
psychological analysis, some pilot strategies, some test marketing, some
focus groups, some follow-up evaluation, some fine tuning, and then
perhaps, a gradually expanding effort.  Absent evidence of such a plan, I'd
say it's time to return to the original question, "How do you sell cryonics?"

	But before I do that, I think I'll take a moment to cut the pioneers some
slack, and show some respect.  

	In life, timing plays a big role.  For at least 40,000 years before Dr.
Ettinger published "The Prospect", humans had come to know death as a
certainty, so it seems reasonable that it should take them a while to get
over it.  

	In the early 60s, to an unsophisticated America, cryonics could only have
been seen as the most outlandish of science fiction. There was no genetic
engineering, no computers, no organ transplants, no cloning, no space
travel, no hint of nanotechnology, no idea of a technology for cellular
repair or for the need of such a technology.  Cryonics was a dream, an
alien meme. Newly minted it would be, by definition, ahead of its time:
unbelievable, unacceptable, unsellable.  In short, cryonics would have to
wait for the world to catch up.  

	Meanwhile there was work to do.  To "sell" cryonics would take the
formation of a core group of advocates, and their promotional efforts over
many years, in the face of substantial ridicule, to lay the groundwork for
a wider acceptance.  It would take time and science to bring the world to a
level of technological sophistication where the techniques of cryonic
suspension could be seen as achievable. It would take a population so
accustomed to the ever-accelerating pace of technological progress, that
the death meme, ancient and entrenched, might become vulnerable to the meme
of technological possibility.  Can that be the state at which we have
arrived today?  I suggest that it is--if not now, when?--and that the
perception of cryonics marketing as a failure is at least partly about
timing.  Visionaries are always early and impatient. 

	On May 1st Saul wrote:

"... I think most people are aware (to one degree or another) of the
following perceptions, which strongly influence them in deciding not to
sign up for cryonics:

1)	No major human or animal organ has been cryopreserved, thawed and
transplanted successfully.
2)	No human or large animal has ever been revived after cryopreservation.
3)	Animal and human tissues are seriously damaged by freezing and thawing.
4)	It is not possible to restore people to life after "death".
5)	Virtually all mainstream scientists say that  "Cryonics won't work!"

	I think that these perceptions contribute collectively to the opinion that
cryonics won't work, and that this opinion is the number one reason people
don't sign up."

	Again, I disagree, but beyond that, if you look closely at the above, you
might just find, hidden in plain sight, the main reason for the cryonics
marketing failure.  

	The above is a "rational" argument.  Putative factual elements, mobilized
and presented in logical fashion to compel acceptance of a conclusion.
Facts.  Discovery of facts.  Ordering of facts. Assessments based on facts.
Decisions based on facts. This is rationalism.  Most cryonicists think of
themselves as rationalists, and as a consequence, individually and even
more so collectively, they misread human nature.  Human beings are
creatures of passion, profoundly so; and consequently, profoundly
irrational.  The cryonicists' failure to grasp this fundamental truth lies
at the heart of their marketing failure.  They have addressed the sales
problem as a problem of persuasion by rational exposition, when, in fact,
it is a wholly emotional event.  Rationality is only the thinnest, most
insubstantial veneer, overlaid on a billion years of instinct and passion.

	Salesmen know.  You sell the sizzle not the steak.

	So what then is the reason people don't sign up, beyond a concept too new,
and unenlightened salesmanship?  Let's look at the psychological basis for
rejecting an idea, and see what it implies about the wide range of reasons
given for rejecting cryonics.  

	Group social structure evolved because it has survival advantages.
Advantages against predators and advantages against competing groups of the
same or similar species. When humans developed the capacity for cognition
and abstraction, the herd became the tribe, and the patterns of perceived
reality became a belief structure.  A belief structure held in common is
the membership card to the group, with all that that implies for individual
identity and survival.  Consequently, any idea which conflicts with an
individual's belief structure, threatens survival, and is rejected
reflexively.  Thus when a Fredric Pohl, who clearly possesses the
intellectual qualifications to embrace cryonics, says vaguely, "It doesn't
seem right", you're seeing an example of that reflex in action.  And in
considering all the anecdotes of cryonics rejection, I am drawn to the
conclusion that most all of them originate in that reflex.  (Could it be
that all human contentiousness over ideas is a manifestation of this
primitive reflex?)  

	So what does this have to do with the reality of cryonics sales?  Well,
the empiricist tries stuff till he finds something that works.  The
theorist seeks underlying principles from which he hopes to fashion a more
deliberate approach. (What's this called?  Let's see...ah, yes.  Science.)
Consider the rejection reflex as the underlying principle.

	So the question becomes, how to penetrate with a "foreign" idea, a belief
structure protected by a strong, pre-rational, rejection reflex?   A nerdy
formulation, but hey, that's science!

So here are some general approaches.  

	Plant the idea before the defenses are built, ie. when they're young and
impressionable.  As the twig is bent so grows the meme. (Forgive me, I just
couldn't resist.)  Disguise the idea and sneak it in (fable or folk tale or
TV series).  Escort the idea in with a trusted emissary: mom, Doc Smith,
cultural icon, Walter Cronkhite.  Hitch the idea to a powerful force: love,
sex, money, freedom, fear.  Seek and exploit a moment of enhanced
vulnerability, ie., when the defenses are breached by circumstance.(More on
this later.)  Attack the defenses with deliberate violence: Enlightenment
and life, or ignorance and death? Your choice.  Find a back door/unguarded
entry.(More later.)  Lay seige and wear them down.  Peaceably persist,
persuade, assist, insinuate, assimilate, and convert. (Current cryonics
strategy?)  Innovate.

 	Here are some tactics.
	
Seduce, don't persuade.  

	The harder you try: the more needy you look, the more it seems that you're
trying to sell a bill of goods, the more they resist.  Less is more.  Tease
them.  Tempt them with the juiciest rewards cryonics has to offer--health,
youth, sex, money, power, immortality-- and then turn and walk away. The
less you try the more they will chase after you and the harder they will
work to persuade themselves. 

	Pull them with temptation, and push them with insecurity, fear of
rejection, or fear of loss.  "It's not for you", "Not for the stupid", "If
you crave a hole in the ground, go for it", "You say God wants you in
Heaven?  Please, please, don't let me keep you or God waiting!" "We have
FIVE BILLION candidates, we don't NEED you." "If you need convincing, do it
yourself; we don't have the time."  This approach is orders of magnitude
more powerful than any tedious list of facts.
  
Exclusivity

	People want what they can't have.  They opened a club in New York.  It was
called Studio 54.  They put a staff member at the door to screen patrons so
that only the "right" people would be allowed in.  In no time at all the
line stretched around the block and the rest is history.  

	Cryonics is not for everyone.  Establish entry requirements. Make the
candidates pass an exam. (Yes, it's a trick, but you have to help them get
past their own defenses.) Cryonics is not for everyone.  Exclude murderers,
rapists, child-molesters, armaments manufacturers, politicians, tobacco
company execs.  Cryonics is not for everyone.  Only the: elite, fortunate,
hip, worthy, just, wise. etc. get into cryonics.  Only the "right" people
will be smart enough to recognize that "Once-in-a-Lifetime" opportunity,
and gutsy enough to go for it.  Head down in a dewar of liquid nitrogen,
everybody is special.

Greed.  "Greed is good." GG

	God forgive me (just a phrase), but I do love this one.  Greed is just
so,...reliable.  Can anyone dispute this one?  An individual spends a
lifetime fighting to build something only to lose it to decrepitude and
death?  Not!  Now, you CAN take it with you.  Need I say more?
  
Fear, Anger, Stubbornness, Outrage.

	The dark side of the force.  We don't like to talk about them, but there
they are.  And like greed, they are reliable.  And jam-packed with
emotional energy waiting to be tapped.

Love.

	Now here's one we like to talk about.  But since it is key to  three
markets which, in my view, are immediately exploitable, and whose
exploitation can bring about the immediate breakout of cryonics, I'll
simply employ it as a segue to the discussion of those opportunities.

	Eventually, cryonics will grow into a broad spectrum of career, lifestyle,
and investment opportunites.  But for now, in its formative stage, simple
public awareness, acceptance, and some prospect for a growing revenue
stream to support research would be a realistic goal.  While the
identification of and focus on high demand markets would seem to be the
logical approach, I do not see it being applied.  Instead, there is an
unfocused dissemination of the idea to everyone, and no one. (Am I wrong?
Then set me straight.) 

	The first market is, at the risk of seeming foolish:

Pet owners.  Now don't check out on me too quickly.  I realize that most
people, even pet owners themselves, view the extremes of devotion of
(other) pet owners toward their pets as silly and embarrassing (it's
embarrassing because they know that secretly they feel the same way).  Pet
cemeteries is a bit much, right?  Wake up and smell the opportunity!  Pet
suspensions would be a revenue stream; an opportunity for fully-funded
research, development, and clinical experience in legal pre-mortem
suspensions; and an unparalleled opportunity for leveraging human
sign-ups--"Benji will want you to be there when he wakes up."  The power of
the bond between human and pet is as powerful as the pet cemetery is
incredible.  I absolutely love exploiting human foibles.  It's so,...human.  

	Scoff if you must, but then don't bitch and moan about the moribund state
of cryonics and the threat this poses to your eventual successful
suspension.  Pride goeth before the fall.

	Also worth noting in this context is the "Missyplicity Project".  Scratch
the surface and I think you will find a carefully orchestrated and
professionally executed plan to cash in on pet cloning, complete with
web-based publicity.  Perhaps there's a lesson to be learned here.

	Human beings idealize the lives of those they love, projecting onto them
their own hopes and dreams.  Perhaps it's just a fluke of evolution, but
not necessarily a tragic one, that it is easier to love another than to
love oneself.  Enter the life insurance salesman, and it is no wonder that
people will pay for the comfort of believing that their projected hopes and
dreams are secure.  I thank George Smith for bringing this to my attention.
 We will often more readily pay to save others than we will pay to save
ourselves.  Which brings me to my second market, which I call

The Society for the Preservation of Cultural Treasures.  

	What is a Frank Sinatra worth? A George Burns? A Barbra Streisand?  A
Pablo Casals? A Lauren Bacall?  An Oprah Winfrey?  A Michael Jordan?  An
Albert Einstein?  These people, and others like them are (or were) loved by
MILLIONS.  Millions who would readily pay to "save" them.

	Don't misunderstand. Some of these people are dead. Most could afford
their own suspensions.  Most would, presumably, in light of the current
perception of cryonics, reject the idea of suspension, with one of the
usual explanations.  That's not the point.    
	
	Ordinary people will break down their own defenses and readily embrace
cryonics if it is linked to something so personally heroic and emotionally
compelling as saving those they love and idolize.  From there it is a small
step to embracing cryonics for themselves.   

	Moreover, these cultural icons--stars if you will--are the energy source
at the center of the the human cultural experience.  Thrusting cryonics
into that fire--a step that seems at some point inevitable--will emblazon
it incandescent in the public imagination.  Which is precisely where it
should be.

	So the SPCT solicits funds/donations from fans for the preservation of
their idols, for research, or for later use by the donor as a prepayment
for their own suspension.  In the process the "It'll never work" meme is
transformed into the "I am committed to making it work" meme.

	There are those who will express concern over the firestorm of controversy
that this must inevitably provoke.  But cryonics will not grow without a
helluva a fight.  So if not now, when?

	Which brings me to the last of the immediately exploitable markets.  It is
at once the largest, most obvious, most accessible, most challenging, most
dangerous, and most controversial. 

	One of the original applications of cryonics was for the treatment of
currently untreatable medical conditions.  Get to the future and get cured.
 The reality of disease and death from which this idea originated is still
with us.  At the following internet address

http://www.ca-journal.org/figures/figures_1998/48_006-029/48_006-029_t02.gif

you can find the statistics for 564,000 people who will(?) succomb to
cancer in 1998.

	Where is the outreach program to inform these candidates of the cryonics
option?

	When we talk about missed opportunities to promote cryonics, this one
regularly suggests itself to me.  Beyond the missed opportunity, however,
is what has often struck me something of an ethical lapse on the part of
the cryonics community.  Every day, in oncology clinics around the world,
people are being given a death sentence.  The doctor describes two options:
we can make you comfortable, or we can experiment on you.  Most people are
aware of a third option--the Kevorkian option--but few know of the cryonics
option. In light of the staggering numbers, the terror and tragedy, the
pain and suffering and expense, if cryonics had no more to offer than
bouyant hopefulness it would be a blessing on that basis alone!  But it has
SO MUCH MORE to offer!  

	Success is a near certainty.  We cannot be cowed or diverted from our
ethical duty by dissapproval, small mindedness, or lack of vision.  We
should be pursuing cancer victims like a cheap lawyer on his way to a
hundred-car pile-up.  

 	I personally favor pre-mortem suspensions at any time as a matter of
choice.  The idea that the govt. should control this matter is
unacceptable.  It stems directly from the fact that the world is dominated
by irrationality and governed largely by default.  Find a jusrisdiction
that allows pre-mortem suspensions and conduct them there; or invent such a
jurisdiction; or ... do what you have to do.

	At great personal risk Dr.Kevorkian has demonstrated the courage to act on
his convictions.  He has weathered the legal assault of the state, and been
exonerated by both the people at large, and by the juries in whose hands he
had the courage to place his fate.  In so doing he has set legal precedent
and shown the way for others to follow.  As Dr. Kevorkian fights for the
rights of persons to choose death, can we cryonicists do less in the
struggle for the rights of persons to choose life? 

	The easy answer is yes.  In fact, that is what we have done so far, and
cryonics has not prospered with the choice.  People, creatures of passion
that they are, honor justice and courage, which is why Dr. Kevorkian has
prevailed.  The success of cryonics awaits only a similar committment of
courage, and a willingness to undertake the fight of your life.  But hey,
isn't that what cryonics is all about?  Which is why the hard answer is "If
not us, who?"

Another message from Vinge:
-----------------------------------------------------------
I agree that a person who becomes greater than human would
regard the singularity more properly as a horizon.

I prefer the term singularity for several reasons (and I
think all or almost all of these points have been made by
other posters):

o Very likely the degree of change is going to be on the
  order of difference between a chimpanzee (or a goldfish :-) and a
  human. "Horizon" sounds more like past tech horizons, which could be
  accomodated by the innate flexibility of the human mind. Very
  likely, the upcoming change will be qualitatively greater -- though
  augmented participants might take it in stride.

o The notion of "horizon" has the attendent notion of persistence
  of identity. When change is large enough or fast enough, this
  is a problem. I see two analogies on this:
    + The change that leads from a zygote (or 4-cell embryo) to a
      human child. It might be argued that the early embyro has simply
      been enhanced. Certainly the child encompasses the
      embryo.... And yet the change is large enough that the horizon
      metaphor does not seem appropriate (to me) to describe the
      change. (I do see at least one advantage to the horizon
      metaphor, however; it implies that change is ongoing.)
    + When I think about labile nature of processes in the
      distributed systems that are being designed these days, and then
      imagine what it would be like if the such systems could be
      scaled up so that some of the processes were of human power or
      greater -- then I see weird things being done to the notion of
      persistent identity and the underlying notion of self. Again,
      this makes it hard for me to see the process as one of "us" just
      moving along to better things.

I'm happy to announce that I have discovered what will actually happen
at the Singularity, by the expedient of listing various possibilities
and flipping a coin. I can confirm, for example, that an SI really
would be fundamentally incomprehensible to human beings, and that it
would not uplift them. Whether it would leave them entirely alone,
however, remains uncertain.

Other findings:
i) Change does not stop after the Singularity, but continues to
*accelerate* forever;
ii) There is a "big win" in the intelligence-increase stakes waiting
for the first uploads or human-level AIs;
iii) An SI would *not* start growing in all directions at just below
lightspeed;
iv) We or something we make can (and/or probably will) achieve
superintelligence within decades;
v) Nick Bostrom's "singleton thesis" is correct.

I hope that clarifies everything.

Copyright was introduced to protect the profits of publishers, not
originators, although that justification was later used.  See
"Intellectual Property: A Non-Posnerian Law and Economics Approach"
by Tom G. Palmer in the Hamline Law Review, 1989, pp. 261-304 and
the cover story of the September Atlantic magazine on IP for
discussions of this.

I feel that the property status of information will be the single
greatest non-engineering factor in shaping societies of the next
century.  If we continue down the path of increasing property
protections for information we will likely have a society run by
state/corporate cartels with huge disparities of wealth between
information owners and non-owners and a very boring culture.

However, I feel that anything qualifying as a "singularity" will
be engineering-driven.  Nanotech implies drastic changes irregardless
of the property regime it occurs in, short of a totalitarian one
that could completely control access to the technology.

Title
  The suppression of age-related accumulation of lipid peroxides in rat brain
  by administration of Rooibos tea (Aspalathus linearis).
Source
  Neuroscience Letters.  196(1-2):85-8, 1995 Aug 18.
Abstract
  The protective effects of Rooibos tea (RT), Aspalathus
  linearis, against damage to the central nervous system (CNS) accompanying
  aging were examined by both the thiobarbituric acid reaction (TBA) and
  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods in brains of chronically RT-treated
  rats. Ad libitum administration of RT was begun with 3-month-old Wistar
  female rats and continued for 21 months. The contents of TBA reactive
  substances (TBARS) in the frontal cortex, occipital cortex, hippocampus and
  cerebellum in 24-month-old rats after administration with water were
  significantly higher than those in young rats (5 weeks old). However, no
  significant increase of TBARS was observed in RT-administered aged rats. When
  MR images of the brains of 24-month-old rats with and without RT as well as
  5-week-old rats were taken, a decrease of the signal intensity was observed
  in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum in MR images of aged rats
  without RT, whereas little change of the signal intensity was observed in MR
  images of the same regions of 24-month-old rats treated with RT, whose images
  were similar to those of young rats. These observations suggested that (1)
  the age-related accumulation of lipid peroxides in the brain was closely
  related to the morphological changes observed by MRI, and (2) chronic
  RT-administration prevented age-related accumulation of lipid peroxides in
  several regions of rat brain.

  Inhibitory effects of Rooibos tea, Aspalathus linealis, on

Source
  Cancer Letters.  77(1):33-8, 1994 Feb 28.
Abstract
  Oncogenic transformation of mouse C3H10T1/2 cells induced by X-rays was
  suppressed in the presence of extract of Rooibos tea,
  Aspalathus linealis. Transformation was reduced with increased concentration
  of the extract, so that at an extract concentration of 10%, transformation
  incidence was similar to the spontaneous level. Suppression was also
  dependent on treatment time with the extract and was maximal when present
  during the entire incubation period. In contrast, green tea extract at an
  equitoxic concentration showed no detectable effect on transformation
  incidence.

  The clastogen-suppressing effects of green tea, Po-lei tea and
  Rooibos tea in CHO cells and mice.
Source
  Mutation Research.  286(2):221-32, 1993 Apr.
Abstract
  The suppressing effects of crude extracts of three kinds of tea-green tea
  (GT) from Japan, Po-lei tea (PT) from China, and Rooibos tea
  (RT) from South Africa-on the induction of chromosome aberrations in cultured
  CHO cells and mice were studied. When CHO cells were exposed to each tea
  extract in the presence of rat liver microsomal enzymes (S9 mix) together
  with benzo[a]pyrene (B(a)P) or mitomycin C (MMC), a decrease in the frequency
  of chromosome aberrations was observed. PT and RT, but not GT, also
  suppressed the induction of chromosome aberrations by MMC in the absence of
  S9 mix. When cells were treated with tea extract after B(a)P or MMC
  treatment, RT suppressed the induction of chromosome aberrations in the
  presence and absence of S9 mix whereas GT and PT showed suppressing effects
  only in the presence of S9 mix. These data suggest that catechines,
  well-known antimutagens in tea samples, might account for the inhibitory
  effect in the case of GT and PT. Since RT contains few catechines, several
  unknown antimutagenic components could be responsible for its effect. The
  antimutagenic effects of tea extracts at concentration levels consumed by
  humans were examined in mice using micronucleus induction with B(a)P or MMC.
  When mice received oral gavage of 0.2% GT, 0.1% PT, and 0.1% RT at 1.0
  ml/mouse 6 h before intraperitoneal injection of MMC, a decrease in the
  frequency of micronuclei was observed. The induction of micronuclei by B(a)P
  was suppressed by oral dosage of GT, PT and RT at 1.0 ml/mouse/day for 28
  days. This was not due to a delay in the maturation of micronucleated
  reticulocytes. In conclusion, intake of tea might suppress the mutagenic
  activity of certain potent mutagens in human beings.

Copyright was introduced to protect the profits of publishers, not
originators, although that justification was later used.  See
"Intellectual Property: A Non-Posnerian Law and Economics Approach"
by Tom G. Palmer in the Hamline Law Review, 1989, pp. 261-304 and

discussions of this.

I feel that the property status of information will be the single
greatest non-engineering factor in shaping societies of the next
century.  If we continue down the path of increasing property
protections for information we will likely have a society run by
state/corporate cartels with huge disparities of wealth between
information owners and non-owners and a very boring culture.

However, I feel that anything qualifying as a "singularity" will
be engineering-driven.  Nanotech implies drastic changes irregardless
of the property regime it occurs in, short of a totalitarian one
that could completely control access to the technology.

I thing this project will no expect to generate the most beautiful sound for
the user in a determinated moment, but why not? it could be a great investigation
area (personal music, using subjetive information, but it's closer to the
interactive music area) I don't know if people could buy music like that, but
for example.... hear Mike Olfield's last albun, there is two songs very closed
(Serets and Source of Secrets), they only changes in few movements, but 
you can feel it very diferent.... you can generate infinite variations of the
same kind of song, the fact is that you can generate it with a program, or
the music can selfvariates. The procedural information in the music may
study what's the best to do for a user and a moment given...

I think another path to investigate could be darwinian or envolving music,
that will be closer over time to a situation given or expected.....

I hope you catch my idea well!! :-)

We all seem to agree that in a million years nearly everything would be
so radically different that the world would be incomprehensible to us,
the question is whether this transition could happen in a time that was
short by human standards. I think a breakthrough in Nanotechnology
alone could bring about such a singularity in days perhaps hours, but I
know Robin disagrees with me and I'm not in the mood to rehash that
argument. Eliezer has made a very strong case that an AI could also
quickly change the world beyond recognition. I can't prove either of
these ideas with mathematical precision but I'm pretty sure both are
true. I'm a little less certain that a Quantum Computer could ever be
built, but if it could the world would never be the same. Maybe biology
could radically transform things too, not in days but perhaps in 20
years or less.

The genetic code was discovered 40 years ago but recently evidence has
been found that a much higher genetic language must also exist.
Walter Gehring of the University of Basel in Switzerland found a gene
that's crucial for the development of eyes in mice, he put that mouse
gene into the leg of a fly embryo. When it became an adult the fly had
a normal sized perfectly formed eye on its leg. The really amazing
thing is that it was a perfectly normal compound fruit fry eye, not a
vastly different mouse type eye, even though it was a mouse gene. This
gene must be a sentence in a language much more abstract than the
genetic code and it must say "build an eye here", but it doesn't bother
to say exactly how to build it. It can't deal with the billions of
different reactions in protein synthesis that must occur, it can't even
worry about gross anatomy, it just says "build an eye here" and leaves
the details to other parts of the cell mechanism. It's amazing that
organisms as different as a fly and a mouse, who's last common ancestor
lived 500 million years ago, nevertheless use the same high level
language. The much lower level genetic code is also universal, I guess
when nature establishes a standard it finds it almost impossible to
change.

I started thinking about Gehring's experiment when I read an article in
the September 4 1998 issue of Science about chimpanzees, a Primate
Genome project has been started and should prove interesting because
genetically a chimp is closer to a human than it is to a gorilla.
Only 1.5% of the human genome is different from that of a chimp, and
most of that is just DNA, only about .5% of the active genes are
different. This would also explain how evolution was able to evolve
fully modern humans from our ape like ancestors so rapidly.

These genes are few in number but they're what makes us human, and they
must be written in the same abstract high level language that Gehring
found. If we understood that language then genetic engineering would be
easy, if we want a bigger brain no need to painstakingly specify where
every neuron should go, just write "make bigger brain" and let the
skills all cells already possess handle the construction details. Ok,
we might have to worry about a few details, like increasing the blood
flow to the head for the larger brain, but then again maybe not, after
all if the language is powerful enough to put an eye in a knee with
just one command.

Of course we don't know this language, we will someday but if we only
learn it a little at a time it can't produce a singularity, however I
think there are reasons to suspect that once we start to learn it we'll
learn all of it in a hurry. The language has not changed in half a
billion years so life could have not have endlessly modified it into
an ugly spaghetti code, and if all multicellular animals use it that
may mean it has a unifying logic, a logic that evolution can use to get
at traits and enhance the beneficial ones without causing too many side
effects from interrelations that are so complex they'd seem virtually
random.

Once we understand that logic we may have a eureka moment and suddenly
go from total confusion to complete enlightenment, it has happened
before. When people were working on the structure of DNA some worried
that when it was found it would turn out to be dull, that is, it would
be so complicated that it would tell us nothing about how life worked.
Their fears were unfounded, the structure proved to be both simple and
beautiful, and it immediately enabled everyone to understood how life
encoded information on the lowest level. It's not impossible that the
same thing could happen in our understanding of higher level
organization, such knowledge might not be much more complex than the
genetic code, but it would certainly be vastly more powerful and would
change the world beyond recognition.

I admit it's a little odd that there are 4 completely different paths
that might lead toward a singularity, but that's the way I see it. I'm
absolutely certain everything I've said it true, perhaps I'm even
correct too, time will tell.

Copyright was introduced to protect the profits of publishers, not
originators, although that justification was later used.  See
"Intellectual Property: A Non-Posnerian Law and Economics Approach"

I feel that the property status of information will be the single
greatest non-engineering factor in shaping societies of the next
century.  If we continue down the path of increasing property
protections for information we will likely have a society run by
state/corporate cartels with huge disparities of wealth between
information owners and non-owners and a very boring culture.

However, I feel that anything qualifying as a "singularity" will
be engineering-driven.  Nanotech implies drastic changes irregardless
of the property regime it occurs in, short of a totalitarian one
that could completely control access to the technology.

It's not a "higher level code" or anything like that.  The similarity
between different high-level developmental control genes just reflects
the extreme difficulty of changing anything essential to the organism's
survival.

I hope Gehring didn't claim to have found an abstract high level
language in the genome, because he didn't.  Anyway, it's not the
highly conserved genes that differentiate us from the chimp -
they don't distinguish us from anything.  It's almost a parlor
game with molecular biologists to stick human genes in things
like yeast and nematodes to show they still work.

I don't understand your distinction. it seems to me that  if that's not a
high level code it is most certainly something like that.

I don't know if he spelled it out but I do know that Freeman Dyson
made exactly that claim about Gehring's work.

Possibly.

Maybe I'm an optimist, but I don't think it is practical to increase
property protections for information much beyond where they stand today.
(Lobbyists will try, but whatever the win in law will be unenforcable on
the ground.)

You can't maintain a monopoly on information resources without co-opting
the producers of information. If not all the producers of information
will play ball, your monopoly is subject to being undermined -- the free
software movement, if nothing else, demonstrates how this can happen.

Some types of information may require a large project team to assemble
-- the design of a Boeing 747, for example, a large structured artefact
designed from the top down to meet overall specifications -- but many
other types of information are amenable to individual creativity or a
loose team of volunteers. The existence of entire operating systems,
complete with applications and GUIs, suggests that big corporations
aren't essential for such developments and, indeed, may impose a
parasitic load on the developers. 

Given that the 21st century is shaping up to be the century in which
the informational revolution burns, and given the concommitant trends
towards globalisation, I'd be astonished if a global society run by
cartels could arise and maintain itself in the long term. The only way
they could stabilise it would be to maintain a "war on creativity".

Without engineering there won't be a singularity, granted. But the
shape of the post-nanotechnology economy could be radically different
from anything we expect.

For example, consider the communist singularity. (Or rather, the
resurgent Leninist singularity.) Current developments in Russia don't
look too wonderful; there's a good chance that the vanguard party will
find itself running the joint once again early in the next century. This
time round, Soviet foreign policy may be a bit less hostile to the west
-- the more paranoid fears of invasion or attack by NATO having been
assuaged -- but economically they'll be inheriting a scrap heap. I'm
stabbing in the dark here, but I'd expect them to go for heavy-handed
paternalism and possibly some discreet emulation of the Chinese
modernization model. (Hell, they may even retain the current
near-democratic model and wait their turn in opposition -- the party is
no longer very revolutionary.)

Now inject a mature molecular nanotechnology (developed elsewhere, very
probably) into a regime of this sort that is just getting its feet under
it. What is an authoritarian central-planning regime, with fairly powerful
networking resources, going to make of nanotechnology?

A code allows you to decode something.  Knowing the eye-signal gene allows
you to spot other eye-signals - but gives you no idea what any other gene
does.  With the genetic code, by contrast, I can give you the amino acid
sequence of any gene, including ones I've never seen before.

Developmental morphology, metabolism enzymes, promoter recognizer, etc.
genes - the ones for which such claims are made - are functionally the 
same in us, fruit flies, nematodes, and chimps.  Your eye-signal gene
can't differentiate you from a chimp because it's not different in any
functional sense.  A human who had all the highly conserved genes from a
chimp would be a human to all tests, except to a sequencing machine.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

I find myself answering the same questions in reply emails, so I 
thought I would briefly post a clarification of an earlier post to this list:

1.  It is true that I am no longer a member of ExI.  It is not true that
I left because of 'inappropriate email communications', and wherever
that phrase originated I'm not sure I know what it means.  I tend to
focus on real-time matters, not electrons on a screen.  (I do agree that
postings like the recent 'babes' thread are inexecusable within a group
of futurists.  Heartfelt apologizies for that should be sent to the
listserve involved, however, rather than to me...)

2.  No, I haven't been 'driven away from transhumanism', and will be 
reporting on some projects soon.  If you had an interest in the media 
network project and have not yet contacted me, please do so soon.  
Also, the WTA has some exciting ideas that I would like to help put 
into action.

Take care,

Kathryn Aegis

Copyright was introduced to protect the profits of publishers, not
originators, although that justification was later used.  See
"Intellectual Property: A Non-Posnerian Law and Economics Approach"
by Tom G. Palmer in the Hamline Law Review, 1989, pp. 261-304 and
the cover story of the September Atlantic magazine on IP for
discussions of this.

I feel that the property status of information will be the single
greatest non-engineering factor in shaping societies of the next
century.  If we continue down the path of increasing property
protections for information we will likely have a society run by
state/corporate cartels with huge disparities of wealth between
information owners and non-owners and a very boring culture.

However, I feel that anything qualifying as a "singularity" will
be engineering-driven.  Nanotech implies drastic changes irregardless
of the property regime it occurs in, short of a totalitarian one
that could completely control access to the technology.

The higher level code spoken of here are called the "homeotic genes" that do
code for the body plan of - as far as is known - every organism in the
animal kingdom.  These genes are, of course, regulatory genes and are still
DNA but they do code at a "higher level".  I think after comparative
genomics are done on other animals this IS what will allow humans to
genetically program themselves to transcend their current biological
limitations as Transhumanism (and I) desire.  See some others explain
homeotic genes (guys with Ph.D. and such) from a few links I have collected:

Frankly, I think (online) copyright should be abolished, at least
in the case of non-commercial use; it only serves overpaid lawyers
anyway.

The official two week singularity discussion ended Saturday night.
We can all continue to discuss things of course, but Vinge and some 
others are no longer participating.  

Thanks to everyone who participated.  I hope that this discussion 
helped somewhat to clarify the state of the debate on singularity.

Sender: owner-extropians@extropy.com

My fellow Extropians,


In the interest of personal growth and trying to maintain a certain
brain plasticity, I have decided to take up learning another
language. Although this not my first attempt (three years of French
in high school, living in Japan for a year) it will be the first
serious attempt in a long time.

 I had considered doing this when I was considerably younger, (I
turn 41 on Thursday) but was dissuaded after learning just how many
languages there are, and the fact that I do not seem to have a gift
for learning this material.

I thought I would share my reasoning in the hope of encouraging
others.

I have decided to start with Spanish, because of the large number
of Spanish speaking people living in the Chicago area, as well as
it's percentage of the worlds population.

I have realized that it is not necessary to try attain the fluency
I have in my native tongue, (which I am still learning) but that by
acquiring a few thousand of the most commonly used words and the
structure, I should be able to develop it to good conversational
levels.

I then intend to move on to a second, then a third, and so on. I
may choose French or Japanese next as I have some familiarity with
these.

 I am currently training useing a module from the Random House
living language series which has a textbook and 8 accompanying CD
Roms. I also keep the TV or radio turned on to Spanish programming
as background when I am at home.

Any and all comments or suggestions are most welcome.

I thought I'd share some charts I came across while researching
this.

If you are interested in brain plasticity it might be interesting to learn a
language which is most different from your native language (English?). I
tried learning Chinese, mostly for this reason. It was the one offered at my
college which struck me as being most different from English. I never
attained fluency (so I guess it didn't work) but learned some interesting
things about the language. It's a tonal language, which means that a word in
a certain tone has a completely different meaning then "the same word" in
another tone. This is very hard for English ears to pick up on. The writing
is also a completely different type, where each character represents a
different word (you are probably familiar with this from certain japanese
characters). After learning 500 or so characters you notice certain
regularities in the way that the characters match up with concepts, which
makes it much easier to learn new ones after you have mastered a certain
number. And there's something about a "comment-topic" structure which is
supposed to be very different from English, but I was never really able to
pick up on it. 
If you really, really wanted to challenge yourself, you could try learning
an agglutinative Native American language (Mohawk for example). They do
things pretty much completely different from English. The most noticable
result is that words are extremely long (almost every concept is a prefix or
suffix or transformation - not a single word). I saw some translations
between English and Mohawk and things like "She was coming down the path
picking up things all around her while he watched her" are translated into a
single word in Mohawk. 
Then there's another language which used to be spoken in California (I think
it is no logner spoken anywhere) called Atsugewi, which doesn't use any
nouns. You just say the verb, and from which verb you use, the noun is
inferred (like saying "barked", it is clear I am talking about a dog). Then
you add affixes to the verbs to specify certain types of motion. Like one
affix for moving something with your hand, another affix for something
passing over a fence-like barrier.
Sign language would be another interesting one to learn.

I said there was good evidence a high level language must exist, I don't know
how to reach any other conclusion when we find a simple command can cause
thousands of mouse genes to cooperate and produce a very complex structure
like a mouse eye and exactly the same command can make thousands of fly genes
produce a vastly different fly eye. I also made very clear that we don't
understand that high level language yet, we only know two or three of the
words and none of the grammar. My point was that interesting things could
result when we know more and we may learn more in a hurry.

Genes do not contain amino acids, proteins do. Genes are made of DNA
(RNA in a few viruses like AIDS) and information is conveyed in a
very long sequence of only 4 bases in that DNA. The genetic code is just
the mapping of the 64 possible base triplets (4 X 4 X 4) to the
20 amino acids life uses in proteins.

Exactly my point. Call it a signal, call it a code, call it a language,
whatever you call it one thing is certain, it itself is not an eye, for it to
produce an eye a translation is needed. The amazing thing is that all life
seems to use the same translation book, and that's why I want a copy of that
book.

As written that's pure unadulterated nonsense. My hope is that's not

I actually don't think that the stumbling point is defining intelligence. 
I think we have lots of reasonable ways to make that concept more precise. 
And we know a lot about how intelligence is helps make the economy grow, and
technology improve.  Perhaps the problem is that those who have intuitions 
suggesting singularity haven't tried to express those intuitions
more precisely in terms of the available more precise concepts of intelligence, 
and in terms of what we know about how intelligence helps change technology

To clarify, I don't necessarily disagree with your claim, if you 
use a weak sense of "could" (say > 1/1000 chance).  My main complaint
is that the analyses offered in favor of these claims are extremely
weak, not just by the standards of math, but of ordinary careful 
arguments in other contexts.  There seems to be something about social 
aspects of the future that makes ordinarily careful people get sloppy. 

Let me illustrate with your biology scenario.

You take care to explain carefully what this language would be and why
we might suddenly understand it, and then when the subject of the timing
of social change, you just declare that "perhaps in 20 years or less"
it "would change the world beyond recognition."  Can't you see the vast
space between granting your assumption of sudden language understanding
and having the world change beyond recognition in 20 years?  

Even when you can design new humans immediately, it takes 20 years just 
raise them to see how they turn out as adults.  The entire world population
is not going to immediately switch to having all kids using radically
new designs, and big parts of the world will probably forbid any of their
citizens from trying them.   It'll probably be at least ten years before
any radically different human design is even tried anywhere.  

Consider also the huge investments we have made in infrastructure tuned 
to bodies like ours.  These will give us strong reasons to create new 
bodies that fit in today's cars, can walk through today's doorways, that
walk at speeds similar to ordinary humans, speak using frequencies that 
ordinary humans can hear, etc.  Even if after 20 years 10 percent of the
population had keener eyesight, bigger brains, etc., the world would not
seem to be "beyond recognition".

John,
	I have been following your discussion, and as a practicing molecular
biologist, I couldn't resist helping you clarify some key points:

The gene you have been discussing is a so called master regulator gene. 
Genes in this category function during the development of organism to call
for cascades of cell differentiation and structural reorganization.  In
this way they are interesting for the points you have mentioned, but, to
date, there is nothing that would indicate that there is a higher level
code with possibly the exception of protein subunits (more on that below).
Genes like this are simply switches which turn a downstream event on or
off.  You could use this gene to control many developmental pathways if you
were able to get it to "talk" to the downstream signal transduction
machinery that is already in place in an organism. 

 > >A code allows you to decode something.

The codes you are looking for have already been found.  Other than the
codon triplet of nucleotides in DNA, there are the subunits of proteins
found in signal trandsduction cascades.  By cataloging the functions of all
known protein subunits we could possibly save the time of designing a
protein from scratch. By reassembling subunits you could produce a protein
with new properties, or change the direction in which signals move along a
pathway in a cell.

The eye signal along with thousands of other developmental regulation
signals are highly conserved across all animals from worms on up.  The
reason for this seems to be that the cambrian radiation of animal species
from which all veterbrates and invertebrates arose seems to have happened
in an eyeblink of geologic time, so, fortunately for molecular biologists,
there wasn't enough time once the core genetic mechanisms were set up to
deviate through mutation.  If a creature deviated too far from the
entrenched mechanisms it died.

You misunderstood his point. If you have the genetic code you also have the
amino acid code of every protein in an organism.

As I mentioned above, protein subunits are the only thing that looks like a
higher code.  There is a feeling in molecular biology that once we have a
great deal of knowledge of the different types of subunits, we could
recombine them or design new ones (nanotech starting with proteins).  But
what this does not give you is the design for better large scale
structures.  Downstream of a master regulator gene there is a dizzying
array of signaling machinery which appears to have been assembled largely
through random selection over millions of years.  If we were to design
large scale biological structures we would have to deal with a number a
variables that is staggering, not impossible, but much guidance will have
to come from the fields of complexity and chaos before something like this
is even thinkable.

He is absolutely right!  The reason that we have better than a ninety eight
percent genetic similarity with chimps is that all of our low level code is
nearly identical.  Where we differ is some key internal and external
structural differences.  Those differences probably depend on something
like a gene duplication event or a rearrangement which produced new
functions which were deleterious to the organism as a whole.  BUT, these
changes are the result of changing minute variables in an incredibly
complex system which has been assembled at random on top of other
incredibly complex systems which were also assembled at random.

Don't get me wrong I love biology, it is one of my true passions.  We have
learned a tremendous amount about complex systems and molecular design from
observing nature.  But mother nature is not efficient by any stretch of the
imagination.  I'll put my faith in this incredibly complex system sitting
on top my shoulders to bootstrap us to systems which can understand the
level of complexity on which nature works.  Right now, I just don't think
we have the processing power.  In other words, my money is on the
neurosciences, AI, and nanotechnology to produce the kinds of redesign we
are discussing.  Unfortunately molecular biology is a great teacher, by I
don't think it will be the instrument of change

 So many people? I doubt that there are more than a half-dozen people
who meet Eliezer's criteria, and it's quite possible that none of them
are aware of informed disagreement with their arguments.
 If he thinks more than a handfull of people meet his criteria, then he's
probably overlooking a fair number of them who don't believe in any kind
of singularity.
 I'm sure that Drexler would be interested in debating this in the proper
forum, although it might be hard to find a forum he would accept.

 If he understood your request, I'm sure he would do something other than

I think everybody is a bit sloppy when talking about social science
because nobody knows much about it, and there is an additional
problem. Predicting is hard, especially the future.

You misunderstand me, I'm not saying the singularity will happen by
2018, I'm saying eventually there will be a 20 year stretch of time
during which the world will change beyond recognition. As for when
all I'll say is that it will almost certainly happen in less than a thousand
years and probably less than a hundred, perhaps much less.

Copyright was introduced to protect the profits of publishers, not
originators, although that justification was later used.  See
"Intellectual Property: A Non-Posnerian Law and Economics Approach"
by Tom G. Palmer in the Hamline Law Review, 1989, pp. 261-304 and

I feel that the property status of information will be the single
greatest non-engineering factor in shaping societies of the next
century.  If we continue down the path of increasing property
protections for information we will likely have a society run by
state/corporate cartels with huge disparities of wealth between
information owners and non-owners and a very boring culture.

However, I feel that anything qualifying as a "singularity" will
be engineering-driven.  Nanotech implies drastic changes irregardless
of the property regime it occurs in, short of a totalitarian one
that could completely control access to the technology.

Just as a short copy program can copy all of Windows NT, it may be possible
to perform an upload from a frozen brain without understanding the details
of its operation. All that's required is a functional copy of the brain's
essential structure, ie, neurons, synapses, hormones, etc. Making this copy
is much simpler than understanding the structure's functioning, deciphering
it or interpreting it.

As a cryonicist this is a fact I must face - spiritually very similar to

techno form of reincarnation.

Extracting these memories is a *difficult* problem. I think at best you
would end up with a simulation which like an actor, looks, talks, but
essentially isn't the person simulated. You might be convinced it is the
same, but the catch here is that any person I know has a *vast* amount of
information they use in their response to me, and this information is NOT
visible or accessible via my memories, as it resides in THEIR brain, not mine!

Over the years there have been a number of science fiction stories on the
theme of recreating historical persons and the results of same...I can't
recall specific stories though, I guess my doppelganger forgot them....

I disagree, I think there is some evidence of a higher level code. The gene
Gehring found does not deal with fine structure or gross structure or
structure of any kind, it deals with abstract function. It can't have
anything to do with construction details otherwise the same thing couldn't
cause mouse cells to make mouse eyes and cause fly to cells make fly eyes.
Somehow the abstract concept "an eye" actually has meaning to life and that
smells like a language.

It looks that way.

It's interesting you mention the Cambrian explosion, Davidson, Peterson and
Andrew postulate that it happened when life developed an abstract high level
language and much more complex life forms became possible. Science, 270
(1995) 1319-1325.

Perhaps, but perhaps not. The language of life must have a command similar to
"repeat this construction N times" so changing the size of an organ might not
be too difficult. Changing its shape might be only a little more complex.
If random mutation and natural selection figured out a way to increase our
brain size by a factor of 5 in only few hundred thousand years it can't be
that hard.

Agreed, intelligent design can beat it all to hell.

Yes, those things will probably reach the singularity first, biology is a
long shot.

In normal genetics there is the "species". I am not exactly sure of the
correct definition of when something is a species but shurely two creatures
are of different species when they can not have offspring.

Back in the gatherer hunter days we stopped developing as human species via
genes and instead our development has been in memes. From that day on we
have had parallel development of memes in different societies.

If we use the genetic species as a metaphor for a memetic
species(memspecies) it would maybe help to clarify some of the communication
problems that we have as humans.

One thing is that we as humans generally has less respect for the life and
welfare of other species thinking that human life is the most important.

Perhaps some of our problems when it comes to respecting other peoples
opinions and beliefs is that we subconsciously believe them to come from a
different memspecies. They are not our "species" any more. If they are not
to different they merely have another memetic "race" (memrace).

(You memetic racist you :-) )

This could explain why we lump together on the Internet in cultural groups
and "memraces"

Some memes has great difficulty making "offsprings." Ie it has been
difficult to combine different religious fractions and it has been difficult
to wed science and religion as they come from different memespecies.

Perhaps it even explains why party politics is such a drag for many of us
scientifically inclined people. Politics is in the same memetic memegroup as
religion.

Heavy on dogma and light in search of the "truth."

Unfortunately not. I bought another brand for Irish (gaelic) and
that same brand has another version for Scottish (gaelic) these
unfortunately only come with two cassettes. I'm at the office
presently, I could send you the ISBN tomorrow. 

>I too am attempting to learn this language....I really want to do

The CD's that came with the series are audio only, I've been very
dissapointed in the fact that I've yet to find any multimedia based
learning for languages, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place
(borders bookstore) Anyone have any other Info?

I would love to see a multimedia hyperlearning program like
this.....Hmmmm sounds like a business opportunity.

I fail to see how the demeanor of SIs is relevant to the issue identified in
the original post. The issue is whether we can determine Strong SIs will
ever exist.  There are two scenarios. Either Strong SIs will exist but we
won't be able to recognize them as such due to our own limitations or Strong
SIs will not exist because all SIs will only be Weak SIs. If we can not
grasp the intellectual artifacts of a SI then it might simply be extremely
advanced in its intellectual accomplishments. Maybe it is 10,000 years ahead
of human intelligence. But that does not make it a Strong SI, its a Weak SI.
We won't know the difference until we can begin to grasp the concepts the SI
is thinking about, unless of course we could somehow determine the existence
of knowledge that is forever beyond our grasp (highly improbable).

I am uncomfortable with the idea of Strong SI. This anxiety is not due to
anthropic concerns, Weak SIs will succeed quite nicely at humbling human
intellects. I do not see how we can speculate on the existence of knowledge
that transcends the definition of knowledge. I've seen no rational
underpinnings described to substantiate the speculation that such
superknowledge might exist or be developed.

It's not a language in any sense; the gene has nothing to do with eyes.  It
just turns on a whole bunch of other genes.  These other genes, collectively,
make an eye.  It's not a code either; if you find a new homeobox gene you
have no way to know what it does except by looking at the organism.

Changing size and shape isn't that hard; but designing an organ is.  There's
quite a bit more to a brain than the fact that it's three pounds of fat in
a lumpy shape :-)  We could get a lot of mileage by adapting existing 
organisms/organs, as opposed to designing new ones, and we are already doing
that with bacteria.  You could, potentially, adapt a rabbit to eat some 
poisonous plant weed by splicing in an appropriate detoxification enzyme.
But giving the rabbit a new organ - well, that's quite a ways off.

How integral are our heuristics to our overall indentity? If we plan on
upgrading our minds in the future, this question becomes extremely
important.

For example, I've uploaded my mind into some artificial substrate. I'm
browsing the heuristic libraries looking for the latest heuristic sets
developed by the top Weak SIs. I copy my mind (along with my heuristic
modules) into some form of temporary backup space (just in case something
goes wrong). I instruct some third party agent to delete my existing
heuristics and upload the new Weak SI heuristics into my mind. (I suppose I
could conduct a simulation of how my mind would function with the new
heuristics first but this might create a problem since such a simulation -
if completely accurate - would technically be a new intelligent entity.)

What is the impact of the new heuristics on my mind? Of course, it will
greatly change my "identity trajectories" from the time I upload the new
heuristics going forward. But will I still be me? Is the method with which I
filter data inextricably linked to my identity. Identity might be some
combination of the information (experiences, knowledge, etc.) stored in my
mind and the interpretations derived from that information by my cognitive
filters. If this is the case, then changing my cognitive filters might be a
traumatic and identity-altering experience.

Another problem may arise incompatibility between my mind's current
information storage techniques and the new heuristics. My mind is probably
organized a particular way based on my existing heuristics. How compatible
will drastically new heuristic sets be with my mind which has been organized
by less efficient heuristics? (It might be necessary to gradually reorganize
the information organization of a mind through incremental step ups in
heuristic sets.) Will the new heuristics perform some form of house cleaning
procedure and discard or re-prioritize certain blocks of information? The
identity that emerges after such a shuffling might diverge significantly
from the mind that initially selected to upload the new heuristics.
"Identity Death" might be the new risk in a era of uploads and Weak SIs. [As
always, I'm eager to hear comments, refutations, extrapolations, etc. on my
meanderings.]

Copyright was introduced to protect the profits of publishers, not
originators, although that justification was later used.  See

I feel that the property status of information will be the single
greatest non-engineering factor in shaping societies of the next
century.  If we continue down the path of increasing property
protections for information we will likely have a society run by
state/corporate cartels with huge disparities of wealth between
information owners and non-owners and a very boring culture.

However, I feel that anything qualifying as a "singularity" will
be engineering-driven.  Nanotech implies drastic changes irregardless
of the property regime it occurs in, short of a totalitarian one
that could completely control access to the technology.

In your case it seems the source is your belief that no one knows much
about social science.  This to you excuses ignoring requests for some
analysis in defense of your claim that "there will be a 20 year stretch

An idea similar to this is explored in Greg Egan's novel, Diaspora.
The main characters are uploads, and they are able to alter their minds
at will.  One technique they use is to adopt an "outlook", a specific
kind of alteration which changes the relative importance of different
aspects of their minds.  This is always dangerous for them, because
some outlooks are self-reinforcing, and it isn't possible to change your
mind after you adopt one.  However the characters share similar mental
structures and it is possible to simulate the effects of a given outlook
at a crude level in order to identify most dangers.

This issue is a constant struggle for the characters in Egan's novel.
What constitutes identity?  How much can you change and still be
yourself?  Hermann was an early uploader.  Thousands of years later,
he has re-written himself so many times that he thinks of himself as
his own great-great-grandson.  Death, Egan suggests, is not so bad if
it happens gradually.  Many of the characters take a rather cavalier
attitude towards destroying copies and suicide, perhaps because they have
been forced to adopt flexible attitude towards identity preservation.

Orlando was uploaded relatively recently.  He didn't believe in uploading
but was forced into it by an emergency, and his goal is to someday return
to material existence.  For him, retaining his sense of identity is very
important, yet he is forced by circumstances to adopt ever more alien
changes to his mind, and eventually many of his copies commit suicide.

This novel offers many challenging perspectives for those interested
in these kinds of questions.  It is recently out in paperback, I think.

I almost just posted that URL!  The NYT website has been down, so I 
guess we're all catching up on the science articles.

I thought the article was a very useful assessment of the present 
problems related to string theory, with one noteable exception--it did 
not mention its relation to multiverse theory, and that multiverse 
theory may itself develop into the overarching 'universal' theory, with 
string theory as a sub-universal explanation of phenomena in our own 
universe.  Several excellent articles have been written about 
multiverse theory lately in general media outlets, so it's not as if 
it's not on the radar screen right now.

Sin,

It has nothing to do with any particular eye or type of eye, it has something

I don't understand why you say "just", it seems like an astonishing

One entity tells many other entities to make a very complex object, if that's

If you knew only one word of a language the only way to learn more would be
to observe how the native speakers react to words. Once you knew a few more
words and learned a little grammar you could start to make simple sentences.
I think the best way to learn the grammar of life as well as increase our
vocabulary would be by observing embryo development.

True, and that's just what nature usually does, although the modifications
can sometime be pretty radical. An elephant's tusk is a modified tooth, its
trunk a modified nose, a horse's hoof is a modified toenail, a mammal's teat
is a modified sweat gland and a feather is (probably) a modified scale.

 I think that the problem of determining the existance of a strong SI is
a real one. The old line about, how do you explain what blue means to
someone who is blind, seems pertainent. The main difference that I can
see between SI's and between them and  ourselves for that matter is one
of the quality of  perception, not the quantity of  factual knowledge. A
strong SI might start out being very ignorant of factual knowledge but
due to its trancendentally superior perception would not stay in that
state for long. A hare rather than a tortoise.

It shouldn't be on the radar screen as far as I know, as I was under the
impression that Prof. John Cramer ( of the U of Wash. ), in a paper
published in 1986, extended the implications of the Feynman interpretation
of Quantum Dynamics (esp QCD) to prove that the Schroedinger's Cat Paradox
is not a paradox at all, and therefore, multi-verse theory is bunk. This
applies to the multiverse theory of parallel universes arising from the
same big bang, not from the 'darwinian' theory of universe evolution, where
the conditions optimum for life are also optimum for creation of black
holes that spawn new universes.

Sorry, but here I may have to disagree.  FPGA circuits "designed" using
genetic algorithms have been shown to be far more compact in design
than anything that may be designed in an analytical, modular manner.

Combining intelligent design with goal-driven evolutionary design is the
way to go.

I was thinking of such theories as Alexei Starobinsky/Alan Guth's 'daughter
universe' theory, in which a false vacuum spot creates a wormhole with a
bubble wall on the end of it that pops off to create another universe.  Or
Alexander Vilenkin's 'eternal inflation' theory, which posits repeat 'big
bangs' that duplicate our own.  Or Andrei Linde's 'self-reproducing' theory
that involves additional universes in other dimensions.  I haven't heard how
Schoredinger's Cat applies to these theories, because they only posit
additional universes, not additional universes that violate the laws of our
own universe.  When you think about it, we simply do not know what exists
'outside' of our own universe, or whether indeed we live in the only one.
It may be that if we can come to an understanding of the universe that we
live in, we would then understand other universes that do exist, if any.

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

This is pretty similar to Dan Simmons' "cybrids" from the Hyperion series,

I want to thank ExI, Robin Hanson and most of all Vernor Vinge for making the
Singularity discussion valuable. I thought the respondent essays were adequate
though I did not see anything really new there. Eliezer Yudkowsky's posts were
extremely interesting and thought provoking. I also thought Doug Bailey's
posts about Strong and Weak Superintelligences were very salient. I hope to
see more Singularity discussion in the near term. Its obvious the subject is a
huge one. Even if the Singularity concept turns out to be flawed, the amount
of thought it focuses on future issues makes it worth it either way. Thanks
again.

Presuming that our brains won't become augmented (unlikely) almost any
really complicated mathematical operation or proof is a counterexample
here. The lengthy and cumbersome kinds of strings used when creating true
but unprovable statements per Godel's Theorem is one example. Another more
humble example is truly visualizing the operations of Windows 95 as I write
this message. Then there's really modeling the economy....

The connection with string or M theory strikes me as tenuous.  Re-entrant
wormholes at the particle level, maybe - but that's within a single universe.

As for the budded cosmoses - Smolin's is a nice current version, and David
Deutsch told me that his QT multiverse theory (the Cat is definitely both
alive and dead) is not inconsistent with Smolin's, although they seem
disjunct on an analytical level - both might be true, or one, or neither.

Okay, so the definitely dead cat model (and likewise the definitely 
alive cat model - one and the same) is out.  This leaves the neither-
alive-nor-dead model and the both-alive-and-dead model, and the 
strong probability that within the Standard (or any presently feasible 
nonstandard) Model and given both practical and theoretical 
measuring constraints, which one is correct may be Godelianly 
undecideable without involving us in Heisenbergian observer-
participant tainting.  This reminds me of the argument whether God 
is hermaphroditic or asexual; what difference could it make to 
anything else, since we can't use differences in anything else to 
decide it?  The absence (or presence) of the invisible is difficult to 
detect; the location of the omnipresent is difficult to isolate.

I had a lot of trouble with deciding what to believe about Schrodinger's
cat, and found myself most supportive of the ideas that involve
consciousness (the cat really is neither dead or alive, and looking at it
really makes it one or the other because of the power of being conscious of
a fact). Then last year I came across an explanation called "the

No, it needs to be _replaced_.

For non-commercial use, the Open Content license is a fairly good option.

But.

Any resolution of the essential problems of copyright needs to bear in 
mind several points.

1) How to make arrangements for the recognition and remuneration of
   developers of new intellectual goods, while handling the essential 
   problem of copyright, which is that the cost of replicating information
   tends towards zero but the value of the information (and effort
   required to produce it) does not.

2) With respect to (1), how to authenticate the origin of a piece of
   information. (Libraries of record to accept email submissions?)

3) How to prevent violations of any provisions of (1), without tending to
   damage the free flow of information within society, which is essential
   to our continuing development. (Consider the WIPO treaty as an example
   of throwing out the baby with the bathwater.)

4) How to deal with the transition to the new system, assuming there is
   one. (For example, recent copyright treaty changes raised the length
   of copyright from "life plus fifty" to "life plus seventy"; a considerable
   amount of out-of-copyright work went back into copyright control, and I
   know at least one publisher who was seriosly inconvenienced by this.)

If I had an answer to question (1), which is the big chestnut in this
fire, I'd be crowing it from the rooftops. Unfortunately I don't, this
side of a nanotechnology revolution (which puts the _whole_ economy in
the same basket as intellectual property, thus completely changing the
ball game we're playing).

Any suggestions?

Yes, the Transactional Interpretation which someone else has already
mentioned. AFAIR he uses the relativistic Schrodinger Equation, points
out that it has two solutions -- one going forward in time and one back --
and the end result is that the cat is always either alive or dead, but
the decision isn't made until you open the box.

We shouldn't be surprised that QM should be full of oddities when we're
not using the relativistic version, and from the 'common sense' point of 
view you simply can't tell whether the cat is alive or dead until you 
open the box. This interpretation seems to be a mathematical expression 
of that rather obvious point.

I honestly don't understand why such an important reinterpretation of QM
isn't more widely known.

Could one of you from the software clan enlighten me?
How far away are we from developing a word processor
with the ability to "learn" the common mistakes made by 
the user.  For example, I often mistakenly type "wtih" 
instead of "with".  Seems like after a few spell check 
sessions, a program could learn to automatically 
scan the text, recognize my idiosyncratic mistakes,
and make the necessary corrections.  Much less time
would be spent spell checking.  Just an idea that will 
hopefully make some extropian rich and me less 
aggravated.

I think we already have that, or at least close. If I type "teh" in
microsoft word it turns to "the" automatically, as well as with several
other words (this is word97). When you run the spellcheck, and it comes to a
mistakenly spelled word, one of the choices you can select is
"auto-correct", so that from then on every time you mis-spell that word it
will correct it immedietly before you can type the next one. It is much
better, for me anyway, that it doesn't automatically learn the corrections
by itself, because there are some words not in the dictionary that I don't
want "corrected". "Extropian" for example would come out "extortion". If you
run the spell check and see all your mis-spellings in a row, it's not so
hard to figure out which ones are frequent enough for you to switch to
auto-correct.

What are the predictions about the speed of a quantum computer? I'm asking
for a specific reason. I thought of a brute-force algorithm yesterday for
general design of anything, but it would take super-massive computing power
to be workable. 
The algorithm is this: suppose you want to design a ship that can go half
the speed of light, sustain 25 people, and cost less then a million dollars.
Suppose ship designs are stored as some sort of CAD file, and you have a
program which can look at a given CAD file and determine if it is a ship
that can sustain 25 people, if it can reach half the speed of light, and if
it costs less then a million dollars. So then you start counting, in binary
code (0, 1, 10, 11...), and treat each sequence of 0s and 1s as a CAD file,
and see if it fits the requirements that you specified, then return the best
match. (This is pretty much the standard "brute force" technique for
algorithms). Obviously this is completely unfeasable on any computer we have
today. I think "the age of the universe, squared" would be a conservative
estimate on how long it would take to do such a calculation. If you set the
upper llimit on file length to be 1 gigabit, that's 2 to the power of 1
billion possibilities to calculate. But I wonder if something like a
parallel quantum computer the size of jupiter might make even that many
possibilities something that could be calculated within a tolerable stretch
of time. Even if the calculation still took something like 20 years, it
would be amazing. We could then use the same technique to say "write me an
algorithm that can do the same thing as the brute force CAD design
algorithm, but faster. Return the fastest result."

Generally, if you want to search a search space containing n items, a
classical computer takes a number of operations proportional to n.  Using
Grover's algorithm, this can be sped up to a time proportional to square
root of n on a quantum computer.  Furthermore, it is known that Grover's
algorithm is optimal -- no further speed up is possible for a general
search problem.

A problem like you are describing can be thought of as a search problem.
You want to search through a list of candidate values for one which
satisfies a certain criterion (in this case, being a CAD specification
of a spaceship, etc.).

We have good information about the abilities of quantum computers with
this kind of problem.  We have a proof of the best speedups possible,
and we have an algorithm which gives that much speedup.

Generally, the answer is that the quantum computer takes the square
root of the number of operations taken by the classical computer.

In your case, if your classical computer would take 2 to the power of
1 billion possibilities to calculate, the quantum computer would
take the square root of that, which means halving the exponent.  This
is 2 to the power of 500 million possibilities.

This is far too many to be practical.  The number of subatomic particles
in the entire universe is something like 2 to the 300th.  If each one
of these was somehow able to function as a separate quantum computer,
your problem would still require 2 to the 499,999,700 power calculations.

        In the realm of marine biology it has long been observed that both
starfish and lobsters have very unique traits which, to the best of current
biological knowledge, do not occur elsewhere in nature.  For one, starfish
have regenerative capabilities: if one were to cut off the limbs of a
starfish (as many unknowing fishermen have often done) it does not actually
kill the starfish...in fact it creates five more in its place.  Biologists
know that this is an advanced form of budding, but they do not know how or
why.

        Parallel to this is the growth of lobsters.  In controlled
experiments, scientists have not been able to observe lobsters dying of
"natural" causes.  In addition, their growth rate is not known to subside
with age: their apparent cellular reproduction causes them to continue
growing until the accident curve picks them off.  As far as anyone knows,
there could be 300 year old lobsters living in the deepest areas of the
oceans.

        These two observations have been known for quite some time, yet the
examples are rarely used in regard to human aging.  Furthermore, I have not
personally heard of any research pertaining to the cellular and genetic
possibilies when applied to humans.  If I am wrong, please correct me, but
if not, I believe that this is viable area to look to when considering the 
possibilities of human longevity.

The Cramer interpretation excludes the foggy neither/both possibilities. Since
Feynman models show that quantum interactions are a conjunction of particles
shaking hands with virtual emissions going both forward and back in time (as an
antiphoton is merely a photon traveling backward in time) which reinforce each
other to create real particles transmitted between, and cancelling out virtual
emissions outside the handshake by destructive interference, that there is never a
state of indecision. The cat is always either alive or dead. The two possible
choices are not both made (thus creating two parallel universes)  only one choice
is made, so there is only ONE universe resulting from a quantum interaction, so
multi-verse theory is bunk.

Are these advanced and retarded waves at all related to those of the Lorentz
gauge in classical EM?  My EM textbook said there were multiple ways
of dealing with Maxwell's equations, and described two: the Coulumb gauge,
where the potential throughout the universe reflects the charge distribution
throughout the universe *at that moment*, and the Lorentz gauge, which had
these waves going up and down the timestream.

But if I recall correctly, Gribbin's idea required the universe to be closed,
didn't it?  Otherwise you don't get the proper reflection from the future, or
something.

Bova discussed this in his new book on immortality. If I recall correctly
(I don't have the book in front of me), he did not mention any instances
where the ecology of these entities were investigated for possible

I finally obtained this paper and read it last night.  It is a theory paper,
and the key assumption is that "the phenotypic optimum changes suddenly and
then remains fixed during the bout of adaptation studied."  The paper then
models a hill-climbing search to a peak.  In such searches, one makes big
moves early on, and then smaller and smaller moves as one approaches the 
peak.  

As genes get fixed along the way, the genotype ends up reflecting this 
distribution of moves; some genes embody very large moves and others 
very small moves.  The paper notes that you don't get this effect "if the 
phenotypic optimum perpetually drifts, moving away from the population at 
about the same rate that the population evolves to `keep up.'"  

The bottom line is that this paper *assumes* punctuated equilibrium,
and so is not evidence in favor of it.

Punctuated equilibrium is something that needs to be explained because of
geological evidence.  Postulating it is not a problem.  In fact, I would say
the major problem with punctuated equilibrium is explaining it to the
loony-toon creationists.

As I understand it, the innovation is in explaining the punctuated equilibrium
in terms of an exponentially distributed mixture of large and small tweaks. 
The default explanation is large environmental shifts that increase the
selectivity pressures.  Another interesting explanation is a continually
churning pool of small mutations with some synergetic combinations.  The pool
keeps churning until the mutation has a sufficiently large chance of meeting
up with its synergetic "mate", and then the mutation rapidly becomes dominant
throughout the pool.  (This one is also based on computer simulations; the key
percentage is 14% of the population, or the reciprocal of e squared.) 
Personally, I think that all three explanations describe real phenomena.

Punctuated equilibrium, as the fossil-record phenomenon, neither requires nor
prohibits single big-win mutations.  It is not even necessarily relevant to
the trajectory of a seed AI, since most theories have nothing to do with the
shape of the "hill" one is attempting to climb, or revolve around resistance
barriers that aren't relevant to intelligent design.  I noticed that paper
because it explained punctuated equilibrium in a way that exported fairly well
to breakthrough/bottleneck AI trajectories.  It was the first explanation I
had seen with that property.

Yes, and this theory paper doesn't help settle the question.  If the enviroment
changes very very quickly, then the first few changes can be very big wins. 
But if the environment just changes a hundred times as fast some times as others,
then you just get a distrubution of small vs. itsy-bitsy wins, with no big wins.

I can describe my sense of AI progress in terms of this model as well.  Early
on in AI research people came across the big win concepts, and the rate of 
discovery of such big wins then declined with time.   The main way in which the
environment for AI programs is changing now is hardware improvement.  Some big 
wins have to await enough compute power to verify/study them, and these sort 
continue to show themselves more steadly with time.  But none of these are so 
huge as to create an average factor of ten productivity win for AI programs.    

As best I can tell, your reason for expecting big future wins seems to be that 
you, Eliezer, have personally come up with great (largely untested) designs 
for AI programs, and you're sure they're enough to change everything.  Are you
aware of how stereotypical this is of young people when they first get into AI?

As a description of Then and Now, I think I agree with this.  I certainly
don't agree that we've got all the "big wins" needed to get to the human
level, or even all the big wins possible at current levels of computing power.
 By implication, there are some left, although that might not be true for Von
Neumann architectures.

Well, my other reason for expecting a breakthrough/bottleneck architecture,
even if there are no big wins, is that there's positive feedback involved,
which generally turns even a smooth curve steep/flat.  And I think my
expectation about a sharp jump upwards after architectural ability is
independent of whether my particular designs actually get there or not.  In
common-sense terms, the positive feedback arrives after the AI has the ability
humans use to design programs.

But aside from that, yeah, I'm aware of how stereotypical it is.  I'm hoping
that my Personal Improbability Field is large enough to break the rules.  My
understanding of the AI Stereotype is that the youngster only has a single
great paradigm, and is loath to abandon it.  I've got whole toolboxes full of
design principles, some of which I learned from non-AI code written over the
course of two years, and others which I abandoned, building new theories from
the remnants.  I have no illusions about the tremendous power of any
particular principle.  I think building the AI will take a lot of hard work. 
I can list major problems.  As I understand it, this is generally not the
case.  Still, I could be wrong.

But remember - every now and then some youngster is right, and you _do_ get a
major revolution!  Might as well say that physics is hopeless, since the vast
majority of new theories don't pan out...

(And don't tell me about my illusions about the tremendous power of positive
feedback.  Positive feedback isn't a design principle, since it doesn't tell
you what to code.  Designing modules that the AI can redesign is a principle,
and _not_ a very useful one.)

Not exactly.  The paper provides a theoretical model for adaptation, which
predicts punctuated equilibrium when adaptive changes to new situations
is involved.  The evidence is not from the paper, but from previous results
on quantitative genetic traits which indicate the effects of genes causing 
differences between species follow an exponential distribution.  I found it
quite impressive that a simple mathematical theory has good agreement
with the evidence.  A quantitative theory of adaptation has been a holy
grail of evolutionary biology for some time, and this may qualify.

If speciation resulted from isolation and drift, then the Orr model wouldn't
apply and speciation would not be punctuated.

I once heard a comedian say, "Bill Gates now has $30 Billion . . .

If only one choice is made how does the double slit experiment work? 
If the particle chooses a single slit, not both how does it interfere
with itself and generate a fringe pattern?

Read about the transactional approach,
http://mist.npl.washington.edu/npl/int_rep/tiqm/TI_toc.html.
Basically a wave, going forward in time passes through both slits, and hits
a point on the screen, which is very likely to be some place on the
inference pattern. This causes another wave to go backwards in time. The
path of intersection between the forward-time path and backward-time path is
what appears to be the path of a photoon particle. It is still random, which
slit this path appears to go through.

I've not been following this discussion closely.  Quantum physics comes up
quite often in these circles and, typically, the determinists square off against
the indeterminists or some other dualism forms.  It seems this is happening
again.

Rather than take sides, I'd like to know if anyone has discussed Bohm
on this list?  If so, what do all of you think of his idea of quantum potential?

Thanks!

The Grand Information Exchange - if I publish a book read by a thousand

Agreed.  But just as with other observations of self-scaling phenomena, 
it is important to note how many order of magnitude it has been observed
over.  There was a recent critique of this in Science, I think, saying 
the vast majority of such observations had hardly even looked at one 
order of magnitude.

Granting that there is some variation in the rate at which environments 
change, the question is: how much variation is that?  If it is just one 
order of magnitude on average, then yes the puntuated equilibrium hypothesis
is correct in some some sense, but the "small changes dominate" evolution 
view is also correct.  It's just that "small" varies by an order of magnitude,
sometimes tiny and sometimes very tiny.  If environment rate changes vary
by ten orders of magnitude, on the other hand, then maybe it's a new world. 

I'd have to go look up those QTL data papers to see how many orders of 
magnitude their data varies over.   But I'm not optimistic - Orr brags that
one of the data sets covers 82 traits, which isn't even enough to see a 
half an order of magnitude.

Let me repeat my call for you to clarify what appears to be a muddled argument.
We've had "positive feedback", in the usual sense of the term, for a long time.
We've also been able to modify and design AI architectures for a long time. 
Neither of these considerations obviously suggests a break with history.

I think you're mistaken - lots of those cocky youngsters have full toolboxes.

Huh? Regeneration is observed in many amphibians and countless other
"lower" animals, and the lobster aging phenomenon is observed in
various species of fish, among alligators and other "lower"
animals. There is a whole chapter about this in Leonard Hayflick's
_How and Why We Age_ (OK, I'm *always* refering to it, but it is a
quite good source of data).

I think the problem here is that they are so different from us, the
biochemistry and genetics is fairly different. It might turn out that
our mammal biology prevents regeneration. On the positive side, since
the non-aging traits exist in a lot of species very scattered among
the branches of the phylogenetic tree it seems "simpler" to evolve
than regeneration, and might be a first goal.

Of course, now we are talking about a brute force quantum search. What
would be interesting to think of is quantum genetic algorithms or
other methods that make use of the redundancies in the problem.

You'll see quite a few familiar names in life extension quoted in an
article at:


http://www.insideboulder.com/extra/last-rights/

I'm a bit frustrated at what they chose to quote from me and what they left
out. Especially when, immediately before the first quote from me the
reporter writes: "Butler, the gerontologist, said: "I think we're not
spending enough money on aging and life-extension research, but I'm not
sure if longevity enthusiasts are helping the cause. I think they're
hurting it by their outrageous statements that have no basis in fact." 
Futurists feel no such fetters and rarely worry about exactly how or when
their predictions will occur. "

What I said was that I was not willing to predict when a major life
extension breakthrough would occur since it depended on breakthroughs that
no one accurately time. This quote above implies something quite different.

Still, it's good to see more coverage of these ideas.

On 9/3 I listed these causes of unemployment:
>Search ... Minimum wages ... Capital constraints ... Time runs out ...
>Bad luck ... Poverty ...

I just read a short interesting book, "The Labor Market as a Social Institution",
by (Nobel winner) Robert Solow, wherein he sketches a number of other possible
causes.  These include people working harder when jobs are scarce, firm insiders
colluding to limit new employees, and loss of social status from accepting a job
with lower pay.  It seems plausible that there is an awful lot we don't 
understand about the basic processes here.  Hard to do much fixing till you
know what's going on.

Yes, and there is another way to reduce the problem search space too that I
was thinking of, which is to test not every single possible sequence of 0s
and 1s as a file, but to use a language of command statements, or something.
I'm not sure how to put it, it's easier to understand in language... suppose
you wanted to write a book in this fashion, by generating random sequences
of letters and looking at every single possibility you come up with, and
returning the one that best fits the criteria of being "a good book". Rather
then test every single sequence of letters, it would be more economical to
test every possible seqeucne of english words. Of course the futher you go
in this direction, the more you restrict youself. I may very well want a
sequence in a book that says "So he took a peice of paper and scribbled the
letters 'djfkl;jaffaff' across it, that was when I realized he was
illiterate". An algorithm considering only english words would not be able
to come up with that sentence. But anyway, a genetic algorithm would work a
lot better you're right, and also some way to limit the results to legal
code would speed it up.

Sigh.  Okay, one more time:  The total trajectory is determined by the
relation between power (raw teraflops), optimization (the speed and size of
code) and intelligence (the ability to do interesting things with code or
invent fast-infrastructure technologies).

Is intelligence well-defined?  Of course not, because it consists of symbolic
architecture and goals and causality and memories and analogies and
similarities and concepts and simulations and twenty different modules of
domain-specific intuitions and God knows what else.  The best we can do is
focus down on code-writing intelligence, which suggests specific metrics such
as particular programming tasks, or fast-infrastructure intelligence, which
focuses on domains such as molecular engineering and protein folding.

Is power well-defined?  Pretty much.  A teraflops from a thousand parallel
gigaflops processors isn't the same as a linear teraflops, but all this means
is that the type of power shades over into optimization.

Is optimization well-defined?  Yes.  If intelligence A can come up with the
same solution in the same time using half the processing power or RAM of
intelligence B, intelligence A is more optimized.  If intelligence A writes
code with similar speedups, intelligence A has better optimizing ability.

Given constant power, the trajectory at time T is determined by whether the AI
can optimize itself enough to get an intelligence boost which further
increases the ability at optimization enough for another intelligence boost. 
Presumably the sum of this series converges to a finite amount.  If the amount
is small, we say the trajectory bottlenecks; if the amount is large, we say a
breakthrough has occurred.  The key question is whether the intelligence
reached is able to build fast-infrastructure nanotechnology and the like, or
of exhibiting unambiguously better-than-human abilities in all domains.

Now that I've basically repeated everything I said earlier, will you please
ask specific questions about a specific term?  I'm starting to feel like I
can't win, or that your requests for clarification are only conversational tactics...

Heh.  I must be moving in the wrong circles, because the "cocky youngsters" I
encounter generally send me email filled with silly, overcomplex,
badly-defined theories based on a single unworkable "insight" which they
praise to the high heavens.  While I plead guilty to the charges of not
defining every damn term I use in an email discussion, I think that the
original literature - my Web page - is fairly good about doing so.  I don't
gush about how wonderful the paradigms are, although I've been known to warn
about the horrible consequences of ignoring them.  And above all else, I don't
attribute Moral Significance, the universal bane of youngsters.  I may do so
when discussing the ultimate point of building an AI, and in the very special
case of an AI's ultimate goals, but I don't do so when I'm talking about the
workhorse principles.

At this point, the key question for me is "How much of _Coding a Transhuman
AI_ did you actually read?"  You really can't judge my tendency to
oversimplify from a 5K post about a 200K page.  And can you tell me where I
can find the writings of these eager youngsters to which you keep referring?

Can I translate you so far as follows?
Let P = power, O = optimization, I = intelligence.
For any X, let X' = time derivative of X.
The AI can work on improving itself, its success given by functions A,B,C.
If the AI devoted itself to improving P, it would get P' = A(P,O,I), O'=I'=0.
If the AI devoted itself to improving O, it would get O' = B(P,O,I), P'=I'=0.
If the AI devoted itself to improving I, it would get I' = C(P,O,I), P'=O'=0.
(If it devotes fractions a,b,c of its time to improving P,O,I, it presumably
   gets P' = a*A, O' = b*B, I' = c*C.)

Sum?  Of what over what?  Do you mean that for the AIs choice of a,b,c, that 
P,O, and I converge to some limit as time goes to infinity?

I thought you had an argument for why "breakthrough" is plausible, rather than 
just listing it as one of many logical possibilities.

The problem, as any herpophile will tell you, is that they don't regrow
the bones that were in the tail.  With a litlle training, it is quite easy
to tell the difference between a lizard that has lost its tail and one
that has the original.

This exchange illustrates the essential futurism problem.  The reporter
saw the stereotypical situation so clearly she ignored Max's attempts to 
identify himself as an exception to the rule.  

In many areas, it is the people who say the most extreme things that get 
media coverage.  In academia, people demonstrate how much they know by
saying only things they know can be backed up with specific evidence
and analysis. 

So when talking about the future, people mainly craving media attention
tend to say more extreme things, and academics tend to only state
estimates based on evidence they can point to.  This tends to bias
academic estimates toward the future being more like today.  Others see
this bias and try to "balance" it with more extreme estimates.  In the
end savvy citizens and reporters expect visionaries and science fiction
authors to overestimate change, while academics and others seeking to 
show their technical knowledge underestimate it.  

This situation has terrible costs.  Max doesn't get quoted when he says
moderate things, and I get my papers rejected by academic journals if 
they are about big future changes.  The only solution I can see is to 
carve out a new niche, a place with a reputation for having incentives
rewarding accurate estimates about the future.   Idea futures might do
it were it legal.  Till then, I want to help build communities of 
discourse where any futuristic topic is fair game, but which also have 
high standards of care and rigor in arguments presented.

"I think a more realistic model is" is not a sufficiently detailed argument. 
for t' = a*e^(b*(t+c)).  And even accepting this form, substantial growth 
could still take centuries, depending on the values of a,b,c.  

Your argument here seems awfully close to the claim that "the doubling time 
of computer hardware efficiency is proportional to the computer operations 
per second devoted to R&D in computer hardware, or within all of computer-aided 
`humanity.'"  If you recall, this was my summary of the assumption behind an
analysis from a web page of yours, and I gave specific empirical criticisms 
of it.  You have not yet responded to them.

There really is a rich economic growth literature on when various equations 
like this describe different growing systems, including intelligent systems. 
Growth depends on many factors, and just because a previously fixed factor is
allowed to grow, that doesn't mean growth suddenly explodes.

in my discussions with coworkers regarding nanotechnology
i note that there are no neutrals.  every person will either point
out what a wonderful nanotime that will be, others, the terrible
consequences of such a nanodisaster.

we need to recognize that in any revolution there are
both winners and losers.  the curious thing is that the

who will be the winners......  spike

If you mean with the t' = e^t, I agree absolutely that it's just as worthless
as the Argument from Moore's Law; it's a simple analogy, having none of the
reductionistic detail that's needed for a realistic discussion of AI
trajectories.  As you recall, my actual analysis clamped power at an arbitrary
value and treated strictly with optimization and intelligence.  Obviously, I
don't think that Moore's Law, or for that matter any simple equation for
growth rates, is of real value.

Can we return to the ABC/POI discussion now?  Focus on the technical
discussion, not the immoderate speculations <grin>.  But seriously, what about
the feedback into the system, which is my main argument?

Sure I did.  I responded by saying that I renounced, repented, and abjured the
substance if not the spirit - that the whole Argument from Moore's Law was
fundamentally worthless - which didn't seem to be exactly what you wanted.  Sigh.

"Intelligence is not a factor, it is the equation itself."  You've never
responded to my basic assertion, which is that sufficient intelligence (which
is probably achievable) suffices for nanotech; which in turn suffices to turn
the planet into a computer; which in turn counts as "explosive growth" by my
standards.  It's difficult to see how the literature on the rise of
agriculture relates...

"Sufficient" = Wili Wachendon with a headband.
"Achievable" = The end of my seed AI's trajectory, running on 10^13 ops.
"Nanotech"   = What Drexler said in _Engines of Creation_.

We have spent the last decade researching home employment options 
available to the public. After spending thousands of hours in research, we can 
confidently promise you that NO ONE has better information on this subject.

started working at home in fields of computer work, sewing, 
assembling products, crafts, typing, transcribing, mystery shopping,
getting paid for their opinion, telephone work and much more!

          WHO ARE HOME WORKERS?

They are regular, ordinary people who earn an excellent
living working at their own pace and make their own hours.
They are fortunate people who have found an easier way
to make a living. They had absolutely no prior experience
in this field. They earn a good weekly income in the comfort 
of their own home and you can be next!

Companies all over the United States want to hire you as an
independent home-worker. You are a valuable person to
these companies because you will actually be saving them
a great amount of money.

These companies want to expand their business, but do not
want to hire more office people. If they hired more office
employees, they would have to supervise them, rent more 
office space, pay more taxes and insurance, all involving
more paperwork. It is much easier for them to set it up so
you can earn an excellent income working in the comfort of
your own home.

    -------------------LIVE ANYWHERE--------------------

You can live anywhere and work for most of these companies.
The companies themselves can be located anywhere.
For computer work, the companies provide you with
assignments, usually data entry or similar tasks. You
then complete the project and get paid for each task.
You receive step by step instructions to make it easier 
for you and to insure you successfully complete the job.

After you're finished, you ship the completed assignments
back to the company at no charge to yourself. Upon receiving
your assignments, the company will then mail you a check
along with more assignments. It's that easy!

All the other home-based work (sewing, merchandising, surveys,
product assembly, typing, telephone work, transcribing, and mystery shopping)
are  done in a similar way. After contacting the companies you will
be given step by step instructions and information on what you
need to do. Upon completion of the task, they mail you a check.

You have the potential to work for nearly every company in our guide. The
only jobs that require equipment is computer work (computer needed), typing 
(typewriter or computer), or sewing (sewing machine). All other work requires
no equipment of your own.

Presuming there ARE any winners, of course.  :)  I think it's irresponsible
to suggest that there isn't more than a slim chance that if and when a
nanotech-AI is implemented, it won't simply disassemble us all for parts.

That's not a good enough reason to abort, IMO, but I think one has to
concede that it could happen.

In their book Life Extension, Durk Pearson and 
Sandy Shaw say that the use of a microwave oven 
is preferable to conventional heating modalities
since the microwave will not destroy nutrients as
convention heating will.  However,  Science  News
(02/14/98) reports that this is not the case with
respect to vitamin B12. The reported study showed
that a microwave destroyed as much B12 in milk in
6 minutes as conventional heat did in 25 minutes.

The short article also points out that B12 is one 
of the B vitamins that helps to reduce the levels 
of harmful homocysteine in the body.

                ZEROING IN ON IDENTITY

                 - Identity Defined -

    Identity defines the fundamental nature of every 
    thing, whether that thing is an objective physical 
    entity or a subjective mental construct. To under-
    stand the nature of things we must first under-
    stand the nature of identity. 

    Exceeding the standard definition of identity as 
    just "self-similarity," the structure of identity 
    expresses a duality of (1) self-similarity and (2) 
    other-difference, since we can say that a thing (a 
    part of all) is the same as itself if, and only if, 
    we can say it is different than something else. As 
    we shall see, these two aspects of identity create 
    Absolute and Relative identity attributes. This 
    then is the dual definition of identity:


      DEFINITION OF IDENTITY: 

      (1) ABSOLUTE: zero difference; the uncondi-
      tional nature of a thing that is not derived 
      from external relation; the product of inter-
      nal self-similarity. Example: She must be 
      Mary since she is the same as Mary. 

      (2) RELATIVE: nonzero difference; the condi-
      tional nature of a thing, n, derived from the 
      difference between n and not(n);  the product  
      of external other-difference.  Example: Smith 
      is best since he scored more than the others.


    The identity of a thing is simultaneously (1) and (2). 
    Example: the difference between 4 and 4 is 0 (4 is the 
    same as 4) because the difference between 4 and 0 is 4. 
    So a thing, n, is defined at the same time by both its 
    similarity to itself and by its difference from not(n); 
    and thus  difference (from zero difference to nonzero 
    differences) defines the whole structure of identity.


    SYNTHETIC IDENTITY ANALYSIS

    Numbers are  synthetic identities  that serve as ideal 
    subjects for the study of identity. It is because they 
    are the ideal model of identity structure that numbers 
    and their relations, while synthetic, are unparalleled 
    in their ability to model the natural world.

            "Treat the laws and relationships 
              of integers like those of the 
             celestial bodies." George Cantor

    The structure of identity is ideally expressed as a 
    numeric scale of difference from  zero to infinity. 
    Zero is no difference, or similarity, and all other 
    numbers to infinity are degrees of difference defin-
    ed by their difference, or displacement, from zero.

                   0____1____2____3...

                   scale of difference
                   scale of identities

    Each number-identity along the continuum is defined 
    by its difference from zero  (n - 0 = n),  which de-
    fines the  Primary Relative (PR) identity attribute 
    of an identity. For example, 3 is 3 because 3 is 3 
    more then 0. A number n also has Secondary Relative 
    (SR) identity attributes, which express the differ-
    ence between n and other numbers that are nonzero. 
    We can see this in the differentiation matrix below.

        PR = Primary Relative identity attribute
        SR = Secondary Relative identity attributes
        AI = Absolute Identity attribute

    Listed in the vertical column below each number on 
    the top of the matrix below are its identity attri-
    butes as  derived  from  relations  to the numbers 
    listed along the left side. The identity attributes 
    derived from the relation of two numbers are found 
    at their intersections (fixed-pitch font required):


                        0  1  2  3
                       ____________
                    0 | 0  1  2  3 |
                      |            |
                    1 |-1  0  1  2 |
                      |            |
                    2 |-2 -1  0  1 |
                      |            |
                    3 |-3 -2 -1  0 |
                      --------------

               Using number 3 as our example:

               Attributes of 3: (3,2,1,0)
               by relations to: (0,1,2,3)

               PR of 3 is 3 relative to 0
               SR of 3 are (2,1) relative to (1,2)
               AI of 3 is 0 relative to 3 (self)

    Example of SR attribute: 3 is 2 more than 1. "3 is 2 
    more" is a statement about the identity of 3 relative 
    to 1, thus  "2 more"  is a SR identity attribute of 3. 
    In the same way,  "Smith is 2 feet taller"  defines a 
    SR identity attribute (+2ft) that belongs to Mr Smith 
    relative to Mr Jones.  Smith is also  4 feet  shorter 
    (-4ft) than an elephant just as 3 is also 6 less than 
    9. Therefore, a thing, n, has as many SR attributes 
    as there are other things n can be related to, yet 
    n only has one PR attribute, n. 

        PR = Primary Relative identity attribute
        SR = Secondary Relative identity attributes
        AI = Absolute Identity attribute

    The AI attribute of each number (found at its inter-
    section with itself in the  differentiation  table) 
    and the AI of all numbers is zero. Therefore 

       0 = (AI of 1) = (AI of 2) = (AI of 3) = 0. 

    It is the relative identity attributes derived from 
    holistic relations that define a thing as a unique 
    subset of the whole. Self-similarity is Absolute 
    identity, it is the "home base" of "self," and, 
    being a null relation, is equal to zero. 

    The zero of Absolute identity defines the Buddhist 
    claim about identity, that the inherent (i.e., the 
    absolute) self-nature of all things is void (i.e., 
    is zero), and that what we think of as the thing 
    is merely a product of conditional relations. So
    that central Buddhist teaching is not "mystical."


    CONCLUSION

    The analysis of synthetic numeric identities here-
    in allows us to see and  thereby  prove: (a) that 
    identity is conserved, expressed via the real num-
    bers as a constant zero-sum, since, for example, n 
    is always as much more than x as x is less than n; 
    (b) that identity is  therefore  symmetrical; (c) 
    that Relative identity is holistic, since all non-
    zero  identity  attributes are derived from other-
    difference; and (d) that the Absolute (nonrelative) 
    identity of each and every thing equals zero.


    ===================================================
    WHY DIFFERENCE DEFINES IDENTITY ===================

    Impressed by the complex we overlook the simple, we 
    associate simple with that which we must pass beyond 
    in our quest for the ultimate understanding and truth. 
    Yet, just as the complex structures of a fractal de-
    sign come from an infinite repetition of a relatively 
    simple primary form, infinite complexity comes from 
    the primary simplicity of difference, from zero 
    difference (similarity) to infinity... 

    The numbers along the real-number line express pro-
    gressive displacement, or additional difference, re-
    lative to zero, the origin. Each number is its sep-
    aration, displacement, or difference, from zero, 
    thus n is exactly n more than 0. So the essential 
    nature of an identity is a state of difference.
 
    If there was no difference, there would be no num-
    bers, and if there were no numbers, there would be 
    no mathematics. Before you can build a mathematical 
    statement, first you need numbers, which are states 
    of difference. The same principle holds for physical  
    things, which are also states of difference, such 
    that no difference implies no things. So the funda-
    mental nature of identity and thus of all things is 
    that of difference, from zero difference to infinity...

    Therefore, difference, expressed as subtraction, is 
    unique among all mathematical operations in that only 
    difference defines the primary causal structure of 
    identity.  The  scale  of  difference, from zero to 
    infinity defines the causal  structure of identity, 
    of what it is that  makes a thing  what it is, and 
    thus the differentiation table is the template that 
    defines the foundation identity and existence.

Well why shouldn't it just force upload us all... just like today where you
don't know if you are eradicating an important genetic species in the rain
forrest, you might be destroying some important memes.

If like in the genes where it is often stated that there is less than 5%
difference in our genes, that there only is a 5% difference in our meme pool
we could share a common meme pole and have different "threads" running for
our individual existences and still not feel any the worse. We would just
utilise the resources much better.

This happened before in history and continues to happen now.  The basic
thing we are looking at here is how the mainstream views people and
groups who think differently.  In this case, anyone who predicts the status
quo (in politics or medicine or technology) will cease to exist in a few years
is going to be seen as a bit of a kook.

And what usually happens, if enough people jump on board with the alleged
kook(s) is a movement starts.  The movement then creates its own organs
(e.g., clubs, publications, conferences) and its own "mainstream."  As it
grows, it may become more respected by the wider mainstream in which
it exists.  Typically, the movement begins to cross-pollinate with the wider
mainstream -- by conscious infilitration (as with Fabian socialists in England
and Objectivists in America) or just by living in the same society (which
happens anyway as both the alleged kooks and the mainstream participate
in much of the culture).

Others have pointed this out (notably, Bryan Caplan), but I thought it worth
bringing up here for two reasons.  One, it represents a study of meme flow
-- via meme ecology if you will.  I'll leave the details of this to others.
Two,
we might, by studying previous cultural changes (such as the rise of
Fabianism in England or of the New Left in America) discover what methods
work best to get our ideas out there and, hopefully, in competition with all
the other alternatives.

Have a fine day!

The cover story on last month's Smithsonian
magazine had an interesting article on sponges.
It sems they have a class of cells called archeocytes;  these rove
throughout the body &
can actually change into any other type of cell which might be neeed at
that moment.  A possible model for medical nanotech?

I should have been more precise by saying that punctuated equilibrium
predominates
in *speciation*.  Different but closely related species differ in measurable 
traits, but the differences typically arise from only a few genes.  Gradual
changes in environment, by Orr's model, wouldn't produce the exponential
trends in gene effects, but then they don't seem to produce new species
either.
Orr's model really wouldn't be useful when the rate of onging environmental
is comparable to the rate at which the gene pool adapts.

The variation in effects is a variation in the effect of genes on a given
trait, so hypothetically even a study of one trait could cover an arbitrarily
wide range of magnitude.  In practice, the sample sizes go up with the
inverse of the minimum detectable effect, so I doubt *any* study covers
a large range.  However, it is known that the most important genes do 
roughly follow the exponential model, and the combined effects of the
most important genes explains most of the variation between species.  So
even if small-effect genes are affected by environmental variation and 
don't follow Orr's model, they're not important for speciation, because
the total effect of all minor genes combined is fairly small.

Mere mention of the work "feedback" is not sufficient to argue for a sudden 
and sustained acceleration in growth rates, which is what you seem to claim.

I'm not saying your claim is false, just that you haven't presented a coherent
*argument* for it.  Lots of systems have feedback without having explosive 
growth.  Granted, some abstract differential equation systems do have explosive 
growth, but such systems are very rare in practice, so your job is to present 
some argument why we should think our future growth is more like those systems 
than other systems.  

I searched for such an argument in your volumous web pages, and finding the 
Moore's law argument, I tried to critique it.  But you say you "renounced, 
repented, and abjured" that argument (though one can't tell from your web 
pages).  Just yesterday you offer t' = e^t apparently as an argument in support
of "Why is a sharp jump upwards plausible at any given point?", but a few 
hours later you say it's just as worthless.  

I am happy to consider simplified models of systems as a means to understanding.
My complain with your simple models isn't that they are too simple, it is that
it is not clear why they are better models than equally simple models without 
explosive growth.

(Intelligence is an equation?)
The question is *how fast* a nanotech enabled civilization would turn the
planet into a computer.  You have to make an argument about *rates* of change,
not about eventual consequences.

This thread started when Eliezer referred to punctuated equilibrium
as support for his claim that future intelligence trajectories will 
mainly consist of big fast jumps between periods of little change.  
For this purpose, the relevant question is how concentrated in time was
biological innovation.  And given the framework you describe, to answer
this we need to know both what fraction of biological innovation happens
from speciation, and just how fast speciation innovation happens.  

Even if "the combined effects of the most important genes explains most 
of the variation between species", it is not clear to me that this implies
most biological innovation happens at speciation.  And even for genes
which do "follow the exponential model", the crucial question is "over 
how many orders of magnitude"?

Actually, the attitude you describe is partly what I'm trying to avoid
in my ideal community of discourse.  "Yeah, we look wierd, but they 
persecuted Galileo didn't they?  And abolisionists eventually won, right?"  
Yeah, but most "kooks" really are, movements and religions grow for 
lots of reasons besides the accuracy of their factual claims, and most of 
them are not fondly remembered by history.

I didn't just "mention" it; I talked about the behavior of the sum of the
series of I'1 = C(O, P, I), I'2 = C(P, O, I + I'1), I'3 = C(P, O, I + I'1 +
I'2), etc.  I don't see any realistic way to get steady progress from this
model.  Flat, yes, jumps, yes, but not a constant derivative.

You can't apply the same optimization trick over and over again; that's like
the old joke about compressing Usenet down to one byte with lossless
compression.  If optimization yields a small jump, then the next increment of
optimization is likely to be zero, since much the same method is being used. 
If optimization yields a big jump, one that translates into a substantial
amount of power freed up for intelligence, the AI is likely to redesign itself
in a fairly major way - from 1.1 to 2.0, or at least 1.0 to 1.1.  Major
repartitioning of the computational modules, and whatnot, which in turn is
likely to lead to a large jump in intelligence and optimization.

Now either these large steps keep repeating to superintelligence, or at some
point the AI can't redesign or optimize itself.  I don't believe in slow,
steady, improvement.  Debugging, yes.  But if you're talking about the slow
reworking of code, line by line, you're really talking about a large jump in
slow motion because the AI is slow - if the AI can rework a line of code well
enough to get improvement, without needing to add more intelligence, it's all
part of the same "increment", the same I' or O'.  If the partial reworking
adds even more intelligence, then the equation runs even faster.

Final remark:  Given the relative computational requirements of consciousness
and algorithmic thinking, and given the Principle of Mediocrity, and given the
relative linear speeds and the relative processing power compared to the human
brain, I would find it to be a remarkable coincidence if a major jump was
slowed down exactly enough that it looked like slow and steady improvement on
the human timescale, and not flat or vertical.  It might happen, because the
human programmers could be unable to work on things that happened on other
scales, but it wouldn't happen by coincidence.

I don't think that _any_ simple models are good, neither mine nor yours.  I
don't think that any allegedly quantitative models are any good.  If we want
to know what can be done with nanotechnology, the best way to find out is to
ask Drexler or go to work for Zyvex, not extrapolate from the rise of
agriculture.  Similarly, there are big wins in the area of AI because when I
visualize the system, I see lots of opportunities for caching that an
intelligent compiler could easily use to shrink the system to tenth of its
size, as well as adding a great deal of cognitive capacity.  Then when I
visualize the basic problems of intelligence, I think that a computer
programmer writing a programming cortex can get a big win in programming
ability - the same way you could get a big win in music by adding an auditory
cortex.  Right now we're struggling to write the programs that to an intuitive
programmer are only words in a sentence.

In short, I think there are big wins because I've looked a little beyond the
limits of my own mind to see how intelligence can be enhanced with deeper
searches or new intuitions, just as Drexler has looked beyond the limits of
modern-day technology to what can be done with molecular engineering and
self-reproducing robots.  I think there's an unimaginable revolution because
if my mind can see that far into the future, imagine how far the future can
see into the future!  And these are ultimately the only reasons for believing
in a Horizon or a Singularity, and neither can be argued except with someone
who understands the technology.  (You can still get memetic followers who
don't understand the technology but believe in it anyway, but they can't argue
the technology.  I believe in nanotechnology because I'm too busy with AI to
understand molecular engineering, but I don't argue about it.)

Anyway, the primary point that I learned from the Singularity Colloquium is
that neither the skeptics nor the Singularitarians are capable of
communicating with people outside their professions.  (Or rather, I should say
that two people in different professions with strong opinions can't change
each other's minds; I don't know if any nontechnical spectators were swayed,
or whether people with tentative technical opinions have been convinced. 
Anyone?)  I don't think there's anything horrible about that, either.  It's
the way things usually are.

Sure.  I think that rather than A(P, O, I), a more evocative way of phrasing
the equation would be P' = I(P, O), O' = I(P, O), I' = I(P, O).  In other
words, I think that all the complexity and pattern in the equation is internal
to "I".  Intelligence is the most complex thing there is, and it understands
and manipulates any patterns it finds itself in, so given the omnipotence -
self-programming for internal omnipotence, nanotechnology for external
omnipotence - it tends to dominate any process it finds itself in.  You
probably don't find this argument at all convincing, because it's ultimately
one of those profession-based intuitions.

If they can, if they have the will and the technology, why on Earth would they
go slowly just to obey some equation derived from agriculture?

In fact, I might say that here is the root of our dispute.  Economics deals
with limits.  Sometimes a limit gets raised by an order of magnitude and
there's a major revolution.  But nanotechnology and other fast infrastructures
deal with abilities that are omnipotent from the viewpoint of anyone but a
physicist or cosmologist.  And AI programming deals with what Bostrum calls
"autopotence", systems capable of arbitrary rewrites of their own source code.
 It really isn't at all surprising that I would focus on the power and you
would focus on the limits.

I've tried to articulate why intelligence is power.  It's your turn.  What are
the limits?  And don't tell me that the burden of proof is on me; it's just
your profession speaking.  From my perspective, the burden of proof is on you
to prove that analogies hold between intelligence and superintelligence; the
default assumption, for me, is that no analogies hold - the null hypothesis.

I guess at this point I am wondering what kind of useful insights can
be drawn from the conclusions above. I can not find any. I'd rather
identify to what end such a conclusion might contribute before
wondering whether it is valid.

If the knowledge is by definition completely beyond us then it would
be completely beyond our heuristics to analyze as valid. It would be
impossible to prove valid but it might seem invalid when applying
the scientific method (SM). It should be extremely difficult to distinguish
between Strong SI knowledge and bunk. Both will not be able to be
proved valid by the SM and both will probably be considered patently
invalid when analyzing it with the SM. I anticipate some may say we
might be able to sense some validity due to mathematical beauty, 
consistency or some other trait of Strong SI knowledge. But I doubt
this will be the case because Strong SI knowledge will be so completely
alien to us that such characteristics will not emerge from our analysis.

If we are able to sense some trace of validity then odds are such
knowledge is not Strong SI knowledge but instead knowledge forged by
a Weak SI. For example, a Weak SI in 1700 might have come up with 
M-Theory. M-Theory might look like complete nonsense to an 18th century
mathematician or physicist but odds are they might be able to discern
some validity hidden in all the mathematical arcana. It might look like
Strong SI knowledge but it isn't.

Asking Drexler has some obvious problems with bias.  Better to evaluate the 
arguments he presents.  And to repeat myself again, to make a case for a rate
of change, you have to introduce time into your argument.  You have to say
how fast these opportunities would arrive and how fast they would be taken
advantage of.

Please don't attribute any disagreement to my failing to understand AI.
I think you will find that I can match any credentials you have in AI (or 
physics or nanotech for that matter).

Economists know about far more than agriculture.  And you really need
a stronger argument than "I'll be fast because it's not agriculture."

If no analogies hold, then you have no basis for saying anything about it.
You can't say it will be fast, slow, purple, sour, or anything else.  

To me "superintelligent" means "more intelligent", and we have lots of 
experience with relative intelligence.  Humans get smarter as they live longer,
and as they learn more in school.  Average intelligence levels have been 
increasing dramatically over the last century.  Humanity as a whole is smarter
in our ability to produce things, and in scientific progress.  Companies get
smarter as they adapt to product niches and improve their products.  AI 
programs get smarter as individual researchers work on them, and the field
gets smarter with new resesarch ideas.  Biological creatures get smarter
as they develop adaptive innovations, and as they become better able to 
adapt to changing environments. 

All this seems relevant to estimating what makes things get more intelligent, 
and what added intelligence brings.

You just keep repeating your claim about the behavior of the sum, without 
elaborating why one thing is more "realistic" than another.  If C is concave
in its third argument, you get subexponential growth.  If C is convex instead,
you get superexponential growth (which may still be very slow for a long time).
And lots of functions are neither concave nor convex.  Why is a strongly
convex C more realistic?

   IAN: For starters, union of previously assumed to 
   be paradoxically related, or contrary, philosophies:


     o---------------------------------------------o
     o---------------------------------------------o

     LOGICAL MODEL & PROOF OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF YOGA

     Originating in India in the 5th century AD, the 
     system of numeration used  throughout the world 
     today has proven to facilitate extreme accuracy 
     in the modelling of the physical universe. 

     As we shall observe, the  Hindu  number  system 
     also accurately models -- and thus explains and 
     validates as logical -- the core metaphysics of 
     the Hindu philosophy of yoga, or mystical union.


    BRAHMAN: CONTRADICTION OR TRUTH?

    The supreme truth in Hinduism is Brahman. Deities 
    such as Shiva and Vishnu represent mere aspects of 
    Brahman. According to Hindu scripture, "Brahman is 
    all"[1] and yet "Brahman is without attributes."[2]
    Having zero attributes, Brahman is called "sunya,"
    which is Sanskrit for void and the number zero.

         "Sunya: void; the Nothing which is All. 
           Sunya Brahman: [the brahman as the 
              Void]; Supreme Nothingness." 
             Glossary of Sanskrit terms [3]

    According to scripture, Brahman contains all forms 
    and yet is formless; is the knower, knowledge, and 
    the known and yet is "bereft of knower, knowledge, 
    and known."[4] How can Brahman be all and nothing? 
    How can Brahman be and also not-be x, y, and z? 

    This all-and-nothing paradox is the nexus of centur-
    ies of confusion and dispute, not only between East 
    and West but within Eastern philosophical systems. 
    Here then is the resolution of this Hindu "paradox"
    via, appropriately enough, the Hindu number system.


    NUMBERS: MAPPING THE FACE OF REALITY

    The claim that x is equal to all and x is equal to
    nothing is true if, and only if,  all is equal to 
    nothing; for, if x = a and x = 0, then a = 0. But 
    how could everything possibly be equal to nothing? 

    Hindu scripture says that "Brahman is one" (is an 
    undivided unity) but appears to be many due to the 
    process of "differentiation." [5] The mathematical
    definition of difference is that which is obtained 
    by subtraction.[6] The operation of subtraction is 
    therefore both the indicated and logical model of 
    the process by which Brahman appears to be many.

           "Treat the laws and relationships 
             of integers like those of the 
            celestial bodies." George Cantor

    The subtraction table models a system wherein that 
    one system (the whole table) is populated with many 
    attributes by the same process that Brahman is pop-
    ulated by many: by the process of differentiation:
              (fixed-pitch font required)

                       0  1  2  3
                      ____________
                   0 | 0  1  2  3 |
                     |            |
                   1 |-1  0  1  2 |
                     |            |
                   2 |-2 -1  0  1 |
                     |            |
                   3 |-3 -2 -1  0 |
                     --------------


                   Just Like Brahman

               THE TABLE IS ALL & NOTHING

    Exactly like Brahman, the whole table (as a model 
    of a whole universe, or the All) contains all and
    yet is itself equal to nothing, because the sum of 
    all differences between all differentiated numbers 
    will always equal zero no matter how many or few 
    numbers are differentiated. All difference = 0.

    The significance of difference lies in the fact 
    that difference -- from zero difference, or same 
    as, to nonzero differences -- defines the causal 
    structure of identity, which in turn defines the 
    fundamental nature of every thing and existence.
    Therefore, using the example of the zero-sum of 
    all difference to model the supreme identity is
    not arbitrary, but is the exact model indicated.

    ERGO: it's a mathematic fact that the sum (yoga) 
    of all differences (Brahman) equals zero (sunya). 
    The all-and-nothing Brahman paradox is therefore 
    not a contradiction but is in fact logically true 
    with respect to the nature of the identity of the 
    All, where the All is a whole system wherein all 
    members are derived from differentiation, which 
    is the means by which Brahman appears to contain 
    many and by which any identity n is defined as n
    (a number n is primary its difference from zero).

    (The differentiation table, or identity matrix, 
    serves as a comprehensive model of the structure 
    of identity; a more complete analysis of this is
    found here: http://ian.goddard.net/identity.htm)


    MORE YOGA PUZZLES SOLVED

    The differentiation table explains not only how
    Brahman can be all and nothing, but it explains 
    many if not all aspects of yogic philosophy such
    as the  profoundly mystical  and seemingly absurd 
    principle of "Ajati," which declares that nothing 
    ever exists or is ever actually created (the same 
    is referred to in Buddhism as the "nonarising" of 
    all apparent phenomena). The nonarising of things 
    defines their void-like, or nonexistent, nature. 
    As the Hindu scripture Mandukya Upanishad says:

    "[N]either the mind nor the objects perceived 
     by the mind are ever born. ... That which is 
     non-existent [0] in the beginning and in the 
     end, is necessarily non-existent [0] in the 
      middle. The objects we see are illusions, 
        still they are regarded as if real." 

                Mandukya Upanishad [7]

    If there is no difference, and then difference
    arises, yet the sum of All difference is equal
    to no difference(0), then in fact only nothing
    arises, hence the nonarising known as "Ajati."


    LOGICAL UNION OF ATMAN AND BRAHMAN

    Yoga means "union," the union of the identity 
    of the individual,  the Atman,  with the iden-
    tity of the supreme Brahman, which is the All.

    As the differential matrix shows, the identity 
    of each thing relative to itself is zero, which
    is the same identity as the identity of the All.
    The zero of self-relation defines the Absolute,
    or nonrelative, nature of identity expressed in
    the differentiation n - n = 0, which means that
    there is no (0) difference between n and n, and 
    therefore n = n -- the definition of identity.

    So the Absolute identity of each thing (0) is 
    the same as, and thus is united with, the Abso-
    lute identity of everything (0); which also ex-
    plains why Hindu scripture proclaims that the 
    absolute nature of things is nonexistent (0).


    THE GOAL OF YOGA EQUALS ZERO (SUNYA)

    The goal of the practice of yoga is to condition 
    the mind to become like zero and in so doing, to 
    establish an  identity-union  between the finite 
    self, the Atman, and the infinite All, Brahman. 

        "Everything is 'I', and I am no thing."
         Ramesh Balsekar, "The Final Truth" [8]

    The traditional yoga lifestyle strives toward the
    goals of asceticism, which seeks to zero-out all
    desires, attachments, emotions, and ego clinging. 
    The goal of yoga is essentially to cause the mind
    to become like zero. In fact, the goal of medita-
    tion  (the central feature of the yoga lifestyle) 
    is to zero-out thoughts, to zero-out the mind and 
    realize the true condition of reality... zero. To 
    know the supreme become like the supreme... zero.

      "He who contemplates on sunya...is absorbed 
       into space. . . think on the Great Void un-
       ceasingly. The Great Void, whose beginning 
       is void, whose middle is void, [and] whose 
       end is void...By contemplating continually 
        on this, one obtains success [nirvana]."

                  The Siva Samhita [9]

              Buddhists agree with Hindus:

       "[I]t is only through the understanding of 
       voidness that liberation from cyclic exist-
      ence is possible. ...Insight into voidness is
      therefore called 'the gateway to liberation.'"

         Geshe Rabten, "Echoes of Voidness" [10]


    IN CONCLUSION

    The central teachings of the philosophy of yoga
    amount to a logical description of the differen-
    tial structure of identity and the zero-sum of 
    all differences, proving that (1) the "All" can 
    be all and nothing (zero); (2) the arising of 
    infinite differences cannot constitute a devia-
    tion from nothing (zero); and (3) the Absolute 
    (i.e., nonrelative) identity of each individual 
    entity, which is zero, equals the Absolute iden-
    tity of the All, hence their logical union (yoga).

    This essay clearly proves that the most radically 
    "mystical" and heretofore inexplicable aspects of 
    the Hindu philosophy of yoga are in fact logical.

You can't apply the same optimization trick over and over again; that's like
the old joke about compressing Usenet down to one byte with lossless
compression.  If optimization yields a small jump, then the next increment of
optimization is likely to be zero, since much the same method is being used. 
If optimization yields a big jump, one that translates into a substantial
amount of power freed up for intelligence, the AI is likely to redesign itself
in a fairly major way - from 1.1 to 2.0, or at least 1.0 to 1.1.  Major
repartitioning of the computational modules, and whatnot, which in turn is
likely to lead to a large jump in intelligence and optimization.

Now either these large steps keep repeating to superintelligence, or at some
point the AI can't redesign or optimize itself.  I don't believe in slow,
steady, improvement.  Debugging, yes.  But if you're talking about the slow
reworking of code, line by line, you're really talking about a large jump in
slow motion because the AI is slow - if the AI can rework a line of code well
enough to get improvement, without needing to add more intelligence, it's all
part of the same "increment", the same I' or O'.  If the partial reworking
adds even more intelligence, then the equation runs even faster.

Final remark:  Given the relative computational requirements of consciousness
and algorithmic thinking, and given the Principle of Mediocrity, and given the
relative linear speeds and the relative processing power compared to the human
brain, I would find it to be a remarkable coincidence if a major jump was
slowed down exactly enough that it looked like slow and steady improvement on
the human timescale, and not flat or vertical.  It might happen, because the
human programmers could be unable to work on things that happened on other
scales, but it wouldn't happen by coincidence.

I did.  As far as I can tell, they're OK.  But I don't delude myself that I
can understand them simply because I'm an extremely bright person with a grasp
of basic physics and chemistry and because Drexler is a good explainer.  There
is a difference between being an amateur at something, no matter how well
informed, and spending years at it.  It's what you think of as My Specialty
that you wind up with powerful intuitions in.  I can sort of understand why
quantum physics is ugly and General Relativity is beautiful, not because my
father was a physicist, but because there are basic principles that relate to
the nature of causality.  But I don't think I understand in the same way
Einstein did, and I don't try to deal with the problem in the way Penrose
does.  I have no intuition telling me that Drexler is right; I read his book
and he doesn't sound like a crank, he didn't say anything I know is false, so
I have no choice but to trust his conclusions - to default to Drexler on the
matter of nanotechnology.

Oh, I'm sure you understand AI!  Enough to come up original ideas, for that
matter.  Still, you've got more powerful intuitions in social science.  I
daresay that you may even be leveraging your understanding of AI with your
understanding of psychology, social agent interactions, or just the intuitions
you picked up in economics.  Not that there's anything wrong with this, you understand.

My understanding of economics is based on facts about system overhead I
learned while trying to program causal propagations.  The idea of causal
insulation and preventing information loss that lies at the heart of complex
barter - I picked that up from a module I wrote in deep C++ over the course of
a month.  I'm going to have different intuitions about economics, and you're
going to have different intuitions about AI, so we are inevitably going to
disagree if we're discussing something as factually unknown as
superintelligence and the future.  It doesn't matter whether we both possess
invent-level intelligence in the field, because our specialties are different.

You can have a lot of small analogies hold, to things like the laws of physics
and the processing of information in the brain, rather than great big
analogies to entire civilizations.  At that point, you're working with rules
instead of correspondences - with simulations instead of analogies.

The Big Bang was instantaneous.  Supernovas are very bright.  State-vector
reduction is sudden and discontinuous.  A computer crashing loses all the
memory at once.  The thing is, human life can't survive in any of these areas,
nor in a Singularity, so our intuitions don't deal with them.  The Universe is
full of gigantic, tremendously powerful phenomena, but for some reason we
don't seem to get close to them.  If the planet was on a collision course with
the Sun, I can see people saying:  "We've seen ice melt, and the deserts are
full of sand, and when things get extremely hot water evaporates, but there's
no reason to suppose that the entire planet will vaporize.  After all, the
Earth's core is pretty hot and nothing happens except for a few volcanoes." 
Why doesn't our intuition say that things get heavier when they go faster? 
The extreme cases are scattered all over the Universe!  But they don't support
mortal life, so they don't appear in comforting analogies.

The phenomena I'm talking about would have destroyed life as we know it if
they had appeared in any point in the past.  How, exactly, am I supposed to
find an analogy?  It's like trying to find an analogy for Earth falling into
the Sun!  No, economic production doesn't go to zero no matter how bad the
catastrophe, but that's all at the local scale - and besides, if the economic
production had gone to zero, we wouldn't be discussing it.  The same applies
for economic production going to infinity.  Different laws apply at other
scales, whether it's microscopic interactions, velocities close to the speed
of light, or superintelligence.

Punctuated equilibrium is a poor model for that.  Change can be
fast but increases in ability are quite slow.  You may have a blizzard
of new fish species in the African lakes, but they're all still just
fish and not fundamentally different from fish everywhere.

The idea is that if you look at variation within a species you see 
relatively little, even when looking at geographically isolated groups; 
if you look at variation between species you see a lot.  So as long
as a species remains a single species not much changes; but during the 
speciation process a lot happens.

>And even for genes

Wouldn't you say that if the exponential model fits for the important 
changes during speciation, it's not really relevant whether it fits
minor changes?  After all, had the minor changes not happened you'd
still have two distinct species; but had the ones modeled by the expo-
nential model not happened, the species would be indistinguishable.

Let's say that at each moment the AI has a list of optimization ideas to try,
and some indication of which ideas are more promising.  Let's assume per your
claim that each optimization will either fail completely, or result in a 10%
improvement.  There are then two tasks: evaluate and implement each idea. 

As the AI progresses there are contrary forces working for and against
accelerated growth.  As the AI gets more optimized, it is able to implement 
any one optimization idea in a short time.  It may also be able to evaluate
each idea in a shorter time.  But working against this is the fact that the 
AI will wisely first work on the easiest most likely to succeed ideas.  So
as time goes on the AI has to evaluate more and more ideas before it comes
to one that works, and it takes more and more work to implement each idea.

So why should AI abilities get better faster than the problems get harder?  
This is not our experience in other analogous areas of learning, such as 
improving computer hardware.

I disagree with the notion that reasonable people will typically disagree

Small analogies are fine by me.  But to make an argument of them, you need 
to state them explicitly, and respond to criticism about why these rather than
other small analogies.

Yes there are big sudden events in the universe.  But they are unusual 
enough that you need a concrete argument to convince people a supernova
is likely to hit them soon.

Come on - even an empirical trend line of temperature with time would be 
enough to get everyone's attention.  A simulation of planetary motions based
on well understood physics would be even more persuasive.  Of course big 
things could hit us that we don't understand well enough to forsee, but 
that's hardly an argument for any particular big-change claim.

...ian thanks for the links.  please let me take another run at a thread
that
 i attempted some weeks ago, but im afraid the point was lost in a storm
of
protest over privacy concerns.

recently while shopping for a new car, i visited websites for owners of
that model.  i learned more about potential problems with that
particular
model from that website in one afternoon than i would have learned in
years
of collecting anecdotal evidence.  this is simply because the  sample
size (all
owners who like to post on the web) is enormous compared to all the
friends
i am ever likely to have.  {8^D  the web is an enormously powerful
tool in the advance of humankind, yet we are not using it anywhere near
its
mind boggling potential.

nowthen, could not the same web facilitated experience base technique be

applied to health concerns?  are not issues regarding health of our
bodies far
more critical than the health of our cars?  friends, we standing on the
threshold
of a dream.

please work with me, privacy people: how can we use the web to compile a

database on quiet, elusive signals (such as the effect of vitamin e on
breast cancer)?
how can we extract the critical signal while ensuring the participants
privacy enough
to encourage widespread participation in web based health studies?
would we
need a large group of people to post every habit, complete diet
information,
complete medical history, form the proverbial info-nudist colony, in
order to
determine if vitamins prevent breast cancer?  spike

   IAN: That's a willful act of aggression against

   is a difference between logical analysis and ad

  IAN: Extracting the signal from numerous anecdotal
  claims might be almost impossible, particularly if you
  factor in the possibility of intentional disinformation
  that could be inserted freely by various interested 
  parties for one reason or another. I think we have
  to rely ultimately on controlled laboratory research.

  A project your talking about could be done side-by-
  side and see if it comes of similar conclusions. I'm 
  not sure I see what the privacy concerns are, assuming
  people submit such personal information voluntarily.

Tangent: Robin studied physics from 1977 to 1984, and worked in AI from 1984
to 1993.  *Then* he switched to economics.  This is from his web site.  I
don't know where he feels he has more powerful intuitions, but I wouldn't
assume they were in economics.  Or that your intuitions are better than his,
at least based on experience.

Specialty?  What's Robin's specialty?  He's currently focused on econ, but he
spent half your life in AI.

I'm not sure what analogy you're trying to make here.  The one I'm
constructing out of these instances is "Yes, the universe is full of many
sudden phenomena.  Big, simple, destructive phenomena.  But the destruction of
the Singularity is a side-effect; what it *is* is a sudden increase in
complexity.  A creative discontinuity, not a destructive one."

And a sudden jump in complexity is implausible.  The closest analogies which
come to mind are crystallization and the probable spread of bacteria through
the early oceans.  I'm not sure the former is valid; as for the latter, we
don't know for certain what happened, and there's a unique qualitative change
there: the rise of self-replicating entities on an otherwise dead planet.

Hmm.  For judging suddenness of a new level the proper view is probably the
level just below.  No fair judging the Industrial Revolution by dogs or
rocks, or the Singularity by uncontacted New Guinea highlanders.  The rise and
spread of bacteria is unique because the previous level -- rocks -- had no
perception.  Of course, if we take the previous level as liquid reaction time,
it probably took a while.

And so I'd disqualify the rise and spread of Homo sapiens; geologically a
blip, but for large mammals not that sudden.  Certainly African and Eurasian
animals were able to cope, until we went to the next level or two.

So I'd say the Singularity idea is saying that the level of literate and
corporate humans will give rise to a level of self-improving AIs in a manner
which will seem discontinuous to that human level.  Robin and I say "Yeah,
right."  I don't think supernovae and crashing computers are good analogies to
get us to admit our intuition might be wrong.

By finding a phenomenon that destroyed life as it knew it, while increasing
complexity.  (Pedants: I know supernovae create elements for the rest of us,
but the complexity boost happens later, far away, not in the explosion.)

Death is for animals; immortality for gods.  Technology is the means by

thanks ian!  a well thought out reply.  this topic usually generates
a fog of privacy-cautious reactions.  i have been struggling with
this for several weeks, since i posed the challenge of how
to use the web to improve our ability to conduct surveys.  how
can it be arranged so that each extropian can submit only one
survey, thus reducing the possibility of disinformation inserted
by interest parties, while simultaneously allowing perfect protection
of privacy of individuals?

controlled laboratory research has its shortcomings, which is
why we still have recalls on new cars.  also, i cannot access
the information discovered by ford from their research track.
but i can see potential problems by going to a ford owners
chat group.

i am looking for a way to make a database to correllate vitamin
e usage with breast cancer for instance, one not influenced by
those who manufacture and sell vitamin e.  spike

  IAN: True enough, and there's no guarantee that 
  controlled laboratory research is immune from
  disinformation, i.e., results that were rigged,
  although duplication of the research should 
  weed that out, so long as it's independent.

  Also, gathering information from a wider population 
  has its advantages too. In-line with what your
  talking about, I did a little research on the web 
  on a drug that a family member was taking... the 
  search yielded a bunch of posts and replies on 
  some mailing-list archives where people cited
  side effects they were having. Sure enough, 
  when I got to the scientific literature on the 
  drug, they were all there. And the official lists 
  of side effects are in fact simply gathered from 
  relatively small groups of people who simply report
  what they experience, and thus is basically anecdotal.

  Where laboratory research is critical is in understanding
  the exact  physiological mechanics of a drug's interaction
  with the body, and in that way we get a picture as to why it 
  does what it does, and that really explains what's happening.
  For example, if we know that chemical x is an antioxidant,
  even before it's taken internally, we can be pretty sure 
  of a given set of effects that it will have on users.

Well, duh. Reaction chemists are absolutely right in that reaction
chemistry will NOT build an assembler. Indeed, the methods they know will
NOT create nanotech. And no chemist in their right mind would want to
create just one molecule of something.

I can buy blinders at any tack supply house, too...

I don't agree with Robin, I think the singularity will happen, however
if I was arguing Robin's case I know what I'd say, change is slowing
down. Even in technologically advanced parts of the world the change in
daily life between 1899 and 1949 was greater than between 1949 and
1999. The people of 1949 saw the introduction of a telephone and
electricity into nearly every home, running water too. They got to
worry about being blown up by a nuclear bomb, a privilege their parents
did not have. If they got depressed they could be entertained by a
color movie with sound, or they could stay home and listen to the radio
or watch television (I have a working antique set from that year). They
could fly in an airplane or travel thousands of miles in their personal
automobile, and when they got sick they could be treated with
antibiotics or X rays. The Internet is great but I don't think it could
compete with all of that.

Computers didn't effect the average person much in 1949 but many of the
basic principles of their operation had already been discovered by
Turing, Von Neumann, Shannon and others, and even the transistor that
made the machines practical was invented in 1948. In Physics nothing
found in the second half of this century was as important as Quantum
Physics, General Relativity or Nuclear Fission which was found in the
first half. Our knowledge is enormously greater only in biology, and
even here our endeavors to transfer laboratory results into cures for
our ills has been disappointing.

I think all this is the truth, my hope is that it's not the whole
truth. Feel free to attack this argument, I may even do it myself.

Ian,

I tried to subscribe to this list.  Do you have the exact commands handy?
Chances are, when you subscribed, the list send some instructions.  (I
tried using "subscribe neptune@mars.superlink.net" in both body and
subject of email and this didn't work.)

Thanks!

Daniel

  IAN: I should address J. Maxwell's apparent attempt 
  at a logical argument. First I will attempt to make 
  it: It seems that his argument is that because there
  is a system of numbers that does not include zero, 
  that which is derived from a system with zero is 
  not to be taken seriously. That is an argument
  against the entire system of modern mathematics.

  The fact that primitive societies had number systems
  that did not count higher than 3 is hardly reason to 
  reject mathematical conclusions over 3.  I for one 
  believe that the system of complex numbers, of which 
  the reals are a proper subset, is the  most accurate 
  logical system for mapping the structure of reality.

  Maxwell is, on the other hand, free to believe that 
  "Egyptian mirror mathematics" is a  more  reliable 
  system; I would only hope that he could at least 
  attempt to formulate a case for why that is so. 

  A better candidate for a zeroless number system might 
  be the Alternative Number System (ANS), about which I 
  posted here some months ago. Despite my initial glowing
  review of the ANS, further study clearly reveals why 
  it is inferior to the current system of positional 
  numeration, and thereby why zero is the single most
  important number in our Hindu system of numeration.
  ANS: http://flash.lakeheadu.ca/~bforslun/convert.html

 From having designed many survey forms to collect medical info, a good way
to prevent individuals from submitting multiple forms is to make them
tedious to complete.(Its hard to get them to fill out even the simple ones,
much less do them correctly.)  You may lose some potential contributors to
your database who bail-out before they are finished completing your survey
but its likely to deter your average data vandal and the total amount of
useful info gained should be greater. Shoot for having a good approximation
of the truth.

Actually if we just look at the empirical data, Robin has done some curve
fitting which does suggest a Singularity some time in the next century.

At http://hanson.berkeley.edu/longgrow.html he shows how historically the
time it takes for the world economy to double has decreased in several
relatively discrete steps over the course of history.  Extrapolating
forward suggests that we might transition to a doubling time of two years
sometime in the next few decades, with a potentially even more dramatic
transformation a few years later.

Of course without a model for why such changes should occur, it is hard to
give them much credence.  Robin noted elsewhere that the two year doubling
time is in rough accord with Moore's law, suggesting that perhaps it could
be interpreted as a transition to an economy dominated by computing power.

In terms of Eliezer's metaphor, we can't be certain we're falling into
the Sun, but the data is pointing towards catastrophic warming a few
decades ahead.

  I subbed up to a few lists that were on the list
  of lists where that list was found. However, the 
  other lists had "listserv@..." as the subscription 
  address. But this would be what to do here if what 
  worked for listserv programs works for marjodomo:

	  To: majordomo@asi.org 

	  [in body text write]

	  subscribe asi-philosophy

  That's all I did for the other lists and it 
  worked in every case. The list of lists had 
  no more info than that which I forwarded.

  If that fails, contact: Peter Turland <peter.turland@VIRGIN.NET>

I agree with almost all of your points.  There is no single invention or

scientific discovery since 1949 that has been as transformative as any
of the
other ones you mentioned prior to 1949.  I would like to add to your
list the
very disappointing progress made towards wide-spread space exploration,
development and migration.  When I was a kid in the 1970's I fully
expected
that I would at least be helping to build an O'Neil colony at L4 or L5
by now.
Every single popular book on the subject, such as by Gerald K. O'Neil,
T.A.
Heppenhienmer and G. Harry Stine had ignited my enthusiasm and
expectations
that shaped my entire young adult life - including my initial decision
to study
engineering and physics in college.  Needless to say I am neither - a
decision
that was hastened by the 1986 Challenger explosion.

** However, I disagree with your conclusions about change slowing down.
Granted there has not been any major scientific advancement or
technological
development. But there has been widespread social and political changes
that
have occurred around the world based on those early 20th century
advancements.
Youth nowadays experience more worldwide culture in an afternoon of TV
than any
of our grandparents did in a decade.  We are exposed on a daily basis to

thoughts, ideas and images from around the world that constantly
challenge our
world view and personal outlook.  Air travel has made the world a much
smaller
space, with millions of people moving around constantly.  A visit to
California, particularly LA or the Bay Area will push this point home.
It is
so cosmopolitan now that a comparison to life of those areas even 20
years ago
is like talking about a completely different planet.

The internet has accelerated the pace of memetic evolution off the
scale.
Unfortunately this memetic evolution has not yet brought us fundamental
advancements in basic science or technology.

To clarify yours and my position in computational language --  there has
been
very little change in agents (fundamentals), but massive unpredictable
change
in the interactions *between* those agents.  It's not the TV so much as
the
fact that there 100's of millions around the world.  Its not the
computer so
much as it is the 100's of millions of them linking up through the
internet.
That is what's making the difference, especially on a local and personal
level
and I strongly suspect on the global-political arena as well.  I still
think
nation states will wither away as more cybernetically organized
co-operatives,
both business and private, take their place.  History will see such
changes
(those taking place now), as punctuated ones comparable only to the
agricultural and industrial ones of the past.

On the contrary, I take very seriously a zero based system that gave
rise to things like research on the death penalty, capitalism,
catholicism, the U.N. and indeed very effective forms of hypocritical
suppression. This along with my belief that computers would ultimately
be able to gain greater AI power by reverting to a context sensitive
form of mathematics is why I became a heretic.

Systems need to change and they need to be able to anticipate their own
future behavior or change and the constructions that permit them to see
themselves across some stages of change. My gut feeling is that zero
can't do this. That's why I spat back a barbed compliment in response to
your troll. The fact that you objected to IAN GODDARD = 0 shows to me
that you have some residual doubt in your own theory.

ya, this is exactly what i am hoping to avoid with our new web technology.
this old technique filters out poor readers and busy people for instance.
i know that surveys using paper and pencil technology are inherently
susceptible to both data vandalism and nonparticipation of privacy
advocates.  same with surveys done by interview.

is there a way to set up a web site, let everyone choose a number,
ensure it is unknown to the webmaster who chose which number,
then have each survey submitted with the number?  can it be ensured
that the number cannot be used to trace back to the respondant?
can it be further ensured that a data vandal cannot obtain multiple
numbers?  in seeking simultaneous individual privacy and protection from
data vandalism, i  may be asking for two things that are mutually
incompatible.  but i want a computer expert to tell me this.

> Shoot for having a good approximation of the truth...

ok, but can we do better now than before?  i know that the internet
has revolutionized info gathering in car buying.  why not in health?  spike

Let's not get into this.  I made a basic point about the different
perspectives of different people in different fields; perhaps I should have
made a point about the different perspectives of different people, period, but
I thought there was a correlation involved.  I didn't imply that I was any
better at it than Hanson.  I said that there were meta-reasons why
communication would be difficult.  I didn't challenge anyone's qualifications
or imply an asymmetry; quite the opposite.

Arguing about who has more experience is an argument I can't win, almost by
definition.  If you look at the people who understood enough to change the
world, the amount of experience over and above a few years of hard work is
irrelevant.  We all know who and what I am, or think I am, because I said it
the last time I was here; I don't intend to fight fire with fire, or try to
shift the battle to my home ground instead of yours.  Comparing the
qualifications of two very bright people who each have years of experience is
nothing but an ad hominem challenge, and this discussion is doing too well to
deserve that.

One man's sudden jump is another man's slow rise; more and more I feel we're
debating timescales, rather than fundamentals.  From a sufficiently slow
perspective, this planet went from bare rock to intelligence in a mere
fraction of a moment.  We all know that a 333 Mhz PowerPC G3 chip operates a
million times faster than the neurons in the brain, on which scale a year
takes only thirty seconds; and likewise that chip has a billionth of the
capacity of the brain, on which scale thirty seconds takes a millennium.  It
is rather unlikely that a slow, steady advance from the _AI's_ perspective
will appear to us as anything but a flat line or a vertical rise.

The Universe is full of stable things, saith Richard Dawkins.  There are
exactly two stable states in the Universe:  Dead matter, and
superintelligence.  Unintelligent life persists for a few billion years at the
most, but dies with its star.  Mortal-level intelligence destroys itself or
falls into a Singularity.  Dead matter generally remains dead, so it is
stable; superintelligence can preserve itself, and whatever its progresses and
internal changes, it remains "superintelligence" from our perspective.

So from the perspective of a Universe-watcher, the Universe consists largely
of clumps of matter.  Occasionally these clumps of matter flash into Singularities.

- So why are we here, if these are the only two stable states?  Ah, but what
does a Singularity require first?  It requires life.  - But the vast majority
of life forms have not seen a Singularity.  Well then, it requires intelligent
life.  - But our ancestors have lived and died without seeing a Singularity. 
Well then, it requires intelligent life with advanced technology.  And here we
are, with our advanced technology, and now we can foresee the Singularity.

ya, huuuuge advantages.  there is an unimaginable treasure
chest of medical wisdom waiting just below the surface,
waiting for us to find it.  i mean some really true breakthroughs.
i think we will find these thru web based health surveys and
data mining.  all we need, yes, ALL WE NEED friends, is
some way to allow a large population to download a lot of
information about their lifestyle, health habits, health problems,
etc, into a universally accessible database, while simultaneously
protecting the database from vandalism (possibly by health
product manufacturers) and guarding the privacy of those who
contribute to the database.

how, extropians?  how how how how do we do it?  spike

  IAN: Change is defined by its displacement from zero 
  change. If a system anticipates its change, it must 
  use "no change" as a hypothetical point of measure
  the deviation from which defines a state of change.
  So zero is implicit in the measurement you speak of.

That's a tricky definition of change but it's not the only one, e.g.,
FPGA circuits can be made to work without ever using zero.

"One major disadvantage of the Babylonian system however was their lack
of a zero.
This meant that numbers did not have a unique representation but
required the
context to make clear whether 1 meant 1, 61, 3601, etc. "

http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Babylonian_and_Egyptian.html

How I intend to use this analogy in my AI model is by activating the
constructions implied by the "1, 61, 3601, etc. " and then simply
promote the context that eventually causes feedback; without the need to
compare thread results. Massively parallel Internet computers converging
the results of Ingrid's independent component analysis will soon
determine if this approach is valid. If I find evidence that the
Babylonian system can't implement an AI then I'll abandon my quest for
artificial consciousness. Here I'm just using "Babylonian" to refer to
my continuous Ingrid amathematical approach.

Are you talking about the concept, current in contemporary 
complexity theory, of anticipatory feedforward?

The quick and dirty approach is for folks to voluntarily provide it, and
personal Web pages are available today. I would like to see a search engine
which takes a name, or corporate name, and returns the home page URL.

I once looked for Dean Witter Reynolds, and got pages and pages of URLs
which came from local chamber of commerce local business listings. I never
did find the DW home page by web search. (the site was a stupid corporate
dud anyway)

Extending this metaphor is simple:

Joe Blow HOME - Joe's home page
Joe Blow INFO - Joes public info page(s)

Foobar OPINION Joe Blow - Foobar's page about Joe

 What is the size of your survey? Do  you want anecdotal info from the
net at large to comprise the entire database or might multiple databases
that used different survey methods to obtain their data be both more
useful and be able to give you both privacy and highly valid data just
not simultaneously.
Example: Advertise ( through banner ads on the Internet Link Exchange
for example) for individuals to become members of a list of potential
survey recipients (email addresses) then choose from that list at
random. Mail each selected participant a form (an ordinary e-mail doc
with an embedded html doc that contains in its html code a validation
number perhaps) that they fill out and return by e-mail. No one can
submit more than one copy and by stripping out the html doc from the
e-mail there is no way to connect the data with the participant. That
system is admittedly imperfect since it requires that the participants
trust that the survey administrators actually divorce the html doc from
the e-mail address. That would however give you a one submission per
person database for those folks who did have enough trust. Make the
database size significant. That database could be used as a key to help
validate a larger ongoing database to which anyone could contribute
simply by filling out a form on a website.

As to the recent discussions on the singularity via an AI.

If you support the theory that wealth comes from intelligence, which is the
driving force behind positive sum economy, then for an AI to make a
singularitarian explosion singlehandedly it not only has to have the
intelligence of a single human. It has the have the intelligence of that
superintelligence that is the combined distributed intelligence of the world
economy. Or else it would not be an explosion.

-- With nanotech an AI will probably be able to make this kind of
intelligence itself. But the world econmy and thus humanity will also be
able to develop itself via nanotech and make a strong IA.

-- Without nanotech the entire economic infrastructure has to follow along.
If ie a very intelligent computer tries to build new hardware for itself to
accellerate it's growth, it will have to contract this job to an excisting
hardware producer. They will then also have the technology plus they will
get paid to make the hardware. This will all help spreading the knowledge
and wealth of an AI. Thus it will drag society along.

I must say that I find that the last few years with www, e-mail and all that

The problem with computers is that they make inventions seem transparent and
allmost too easy.
To say that many people has computers and when everybody has one that the
development has then stopped, until a new technological tool comes along and
transforms the world, is dead wrong.

Each little piece of software is potentially a new invention. Each little
piece of software can mean more than any af the old hardware inventions.
Imagine how the internet revolution would have happened if everything had
had to be made in hardware.... The browser hardware, the mail hardware, the
mp3 hardware.... etc. The rante of invention is racing along today, we just
don't notice it as it is hidden in upgrades and downloads.

There's certainly some truth in this: The man whose only tool is a hammer
tends to see the whole world as a nail.  Even a broad-minded carpenter seems
to return to default analogies of cutting and fastening.  As a lawyer, I tend
to perceive and analyze social issues in terms of rules of substance and
procedure, where an economist might be more likely to analyze the same problem
in terms of scarcity and bargain.  Some intellectual systems do seem to have
more pronounced tendencies in this direction: Physics and economics are both
notoriously "memetically imperialistic" in this sense, probably with good
reason.  Both have managed to create broad and deep frameworks for
understanding that have yielded real results in the world.  On the other hand,
both have had to come to terms with humbling insights from complexity theory
in recent times.

Thanks for the reference. "The semiotic binding process... uses a group
of alphabets... in a break and ignore... phase locked loop... to create
this strange attractor of anticipation... if only to shatter the present
to get to the future...

Of note, the United States Air Force Scientific Advisory Board (SAB)
report, "New
World Vistas - 21st Century," commissioned by the Secretary of the Air
Force and
co-signed by the Chief of Staff (94), concluded in 1996, on pages 50 and
51 of the
Executive Summary that: 

     '...Novel enhancements in Human-Machine Interaction...be
aggressively
     pursued. The ultimate interaction is Thought Control.' 


http://www.acsa2000.net/john2.html (WARNING: very buzzword compliant)

Why all the above concerns the "Logic of Zero" is because I can't help
feeling that the Thugee tricked the world into a global economic minima
based on the number zero. ERGO: Ian Goddard's learned pattern of
response, which in another fora he might agree could be accounted for by
drug-induced learning without volitional cognition.

Whereas, "The human brain gets out of this eventual evolutionary trap of
closed loop cybernetics through the semiotic-based process of
"Feedforward" anticipatory strategies." I don't hold out much hope for a
world trapped by the "Logic of Zero."

        "In essence, there are forms of non-linear ergodicity that
evolve from focus at certain scalar transformations into chaos at the
next
transformation, and then back into focus at another scalar pattern. "

I've often thought that the persistent idea of zero came out of a
seafaring mindset that had to deal with sink or swim facts of life. To
such as the pirate Russell and his slave traders of the British empire,
a native land based culture immersed in a greater sphere of natural
information would have a hard time grasping this cutthroat's purely
one-sided illusion of a zero-sum teleology. 

Finally I'd like to add that adjusting behavior to cut costs isn't the
way to arrive at a new statespace and that a purely objective conception
of science is nothing more than a pipe-dream; locking us ever deeper
into zero.

hara ra, this approach doesnt really protect either privacy or protect
from data vandals.  consider my recent experience with the car shopping.
i could not find information on potential problems with a pickup truck i
liked, so i found a website.  many posts expressed concern over a new
feature of the 98 fords, that the transmission would not hold up under
the increased load.

then i saw a post that went something like:  im a texas cowgirl and i haul
my horses in a yakkity yak trailer and that trany is doing fine after bla bla
miles, etc.

well, as with extropians, she had the problem of a woman on a male
dominated group and they started sniffing.  (mmmmm, feeemaaaaale,
like truuuucks,  mmmmm)  {8^D  they asked about her horses, she
never responded.  well, if you know horse people, they love to talk
about their horses.  so now i suspect "she" was a ford dealer that
posted that, hoping to allay fears about the product.

the same problem would show up with the example i stated: how
to find the link between breast cancer and vitamin e.  spike

  IAN: I'd call those who respond to nonpersonal
  dispassionate analytical input with naught but
  personal attacks and mud slinging "unstable,"
  and a few others things too, but I think one 
  cannot instill a respect for free inquiry in 
  those dead-set on preventing it, even by holding
  a mirror up to their shameful acts of aggression.

  Consider the above response. It purports that 
  I should not be abused since it gets me upset
  (framing my opposition to abuse as a sign of 
  mental instability), and yet the statement is 
  inherently intended to do exactly that which
  it says should not be done, and is therefore
  expossed as a willful effort to inflict what 
  the author predicts will cause personal hurt, 
  any sign of which on my part will then be used 
  to frame me as "unstable." All-in-all, it is 
  a violate aggression against free inquiry. 

  I can't figure why a list of a group that I 
  think stands for the highest ideals, for free
  and anti-dogmatic inquiry, consistently expresses
  the lowest varieties of anti-inquiry gangsterism.
  But the reason that such reactions are displayed
  by any subset of people is always the same: to 
  prevent with noise the signal of inquiry that 
  is perceived as a potential threat to existing 
  memetic codes... hence the "logic of abuse."

  No doubt, as in the past, my objections here to 
  personal abuse will result in more of the same,
  all the while the initial nonpersonal, logical 
  issues I raised are buried under a mountain of 
  noise, which is obviously exactly the intention.

  I get the message: Go away and stop threatening 
  our memes with foreign-devil ideas and other 
  things that frighten us. It's pathetic!

The same argument seems to apply at this broader level.  The programmer has
a list of ideas for fundamental architecture changes, which vary in how
likely they are to succeed, how big a win they would be if they worked,
and how much trouble they are to implement.  The programmer naturally tries
the best ideas first.

To clarify, I haven't said the singularity won't happen.  I've said
its proponents haven't clarified what it is or offered a coherent
argument in favor of it.  Hal mentions my pro-singularity argument:

I consider this trendline argument to be the strongest case I've heard
for something like a "singularity."  I give it substantial credence, but it
leaves a lot of uncertainty.  A theoretical model of this next big change
would add a lot more confidence, were it available.

My best shot so far is to say that growth is now limited by the rate at
which labor populations can grow, a limit that will be eliminated with
uploads or AIs.  Growth would then be limited by the rate at which labor
can be made more productive, which would be the computer hardware
improvement rate if that was the main way labor then became more productive.
It might be worth trying to formalize this argument within the usual
economic growth models.

Now _that's_ the kind of argument I wanted to hear!  Thanks, Hanson.
[But would you _please_ stop making me an additional recipient?  This message
is very late because it accidentally went to Hanson only!]

The entire cycle described above is what I would consider a single "increment"
(O' or I' or P'), if an increment is defined as the total amount achievable
for any three values of (P, O, I).  You are dealing with fragmentary
increments, assuming that the AI's time to complete any one task is the
occurrence that happens on our time scale.  But I'm thinking in terms of a
series of AIs created by human programmers, and that the entire potential of a
given model of AI will be achieved in a run over the course of a few hours at
the most, or will bog down in a run that would take centuries to complete. 
(As I say in another email, because of the relative speeds involved, and
because of the mix of conscious thought and algorithm, exactly human speed is
unlikely.)  In either case, the programmer (or more likely the Manhattan
Project) sighs, sits down, tries to fiddle with O or I and add abilities, and
tries running the AI again.

What matters is not the AI's prioritization of its tasks, but the ability of
some of those tasks to increase intelligence rather than merely optimizing. 
Pick the AI's task-board for a single level of intelligence, and of course
things proceed easily at first and harder later on.  But what matters is not
the level it starts at, but the succession of levels, and when you "zoom out"
to that perspective, the key steps are likely to be changes to the fundamental
architecture, not optimization.  If the AI is useful, anyway.  Running an
optimizing compiler on an optimizing compiler doesn't go to infinity;
optimization is useless, except insofar as it frees up power for more intelligence.

> So why should AI abilities get better faster than the problems get harder?
> This is not our experience in other analogous areas of learning, such as
> improving computer hardware.

A human society proceeds at a fairly constant pace because it is made up of
such a variety of intelligences.  There are a lot of uninspired nobodies and
many competent researches and a few creative minds and a supergenius once
every few generations.  All these combine to lend a fair steadiness to the
rate of speed; no breakthrough adds up and up, because the geniuses have only
a limited number of initial insights and eventually pass their prime; no
bottleneck persists forever, because a genius always comes along sooner or
later.  There are all matter of negative feedbacks and inertias, ranging from
lack of popular support to conservative oldsters.  (I am thinking particularly
of the history of physics.)

But an AI is a single person, and its level of intelligence is unitary.  (Oh,
this isn't necessarily true and I know it, but it is more true of an AI than
of a human society.)  Imagine if all the physicists in the world had exactly
the same amount of brainpower, if the whole were linked.  They would not pass
to Newtonian gravitation until all of them were Newtons, but then they would
remain Newtons during the next few centuries; and we must moreover imagine
that they would be totally unhampered by conservatism, or politics, or
attachment to a particular idea, because we their makers would not have built
it in.  And then the society of Newtons would pass onward at whatever rate
they did, and would not proceed to 20th-century physics until Einstein came
along, but then they would all be Einsteins forever after, Einstein in his prime.

I think that the result of this on a small scale would be exactly what Hanson
has described.  With each new level of intelligence, there would be an initial
spurt of ideas (of whatever magnitude), then a leveling off.  (Just like AM
and EURISKO.)  There would be no steady progress, as we have now, because
there would be no diversity.

But returning to seed AIs, if the spurt of progress could reach a new level of
intelligence, one becomes concerned with the whole ladder and not with any
individual step.  Each rung on the ladder is clearly labeled with a height the
climber may reach up, the length of ver arms.  Now either the climber may go
from bottom to top, or ve will reach an impasse.  If each new rung lengthens
the arms over a period of time, quickly at first, and then exponentially
decreasing the increment with time (does Hanson prefer another function?), it
still remains true that if the climber cannot reach the next rung on the first
try, ve is not likely to reach it on the second; if ve cannot reach it on the
fourth, ve is virtually certain not to reach it on the sixteenth, and the
climber shall hang there until a human comes along to give ver a boost.

One thing is labour, but what i find more important than labor is the labors
ability to learn. "To work smarter not harder" :-). If not, how come then
that such a "small" group as the industrial world holds so much power and
wealth compared to the rest of the world?

Ahh but that is too simple an explanation. Off course it holds some truth
but many of the thing that the industrial countries have stolen or bought
cheap has had no or little actual value without the knowhow to use them. Oil
is one example.

Besides there are plenty of small industrialised countries that could have
been robbed but hasn't, and a lot of Asian countries are getting a lot more
wealthy these days without robbing anybody.

The world is getting wealthier each and every day because of technology and
knowhow.

Wealth is not a zero sum game.

I'm not a chemist. After reading Nanosystems, I decided that it sounded plausible,
but that I wanted to see some critical analyses. I could not find any
refutations of anything in the book, so I posted to several newsgroups, asking
for any references at all to a viable refutation. I got lots of references
to various hand-waving web sites, but nothing at all quantitative and nothing
that purported to identify a specific flaw in the book. I then aske a the
foresight fellows meeting in Palo Alto in May (my first.) Apparently,
nobody has seen any such paper. Do you  have a reference for one? Thanks.

Maxm, the Asian countries were just being fattened the slaughter.
Neither New Zealand or Australia can't be included in your list of small
industrialized countries because they have certainly been robbed by
so-called "top people" who just love countries without extradition
treaties.

It has been easier on the other countries recently because we (1) 
have been willing to give them the technology necessary to process 
and manucacture goods out of their own resources, (2) have 
allowed them to retain those resources in order to process them 
themselves, and (3) have refrained from destroying either resource 
extraction facilities or the factories to process and manufacture 
goods from them.  Our willingness to permit all this has a lot to do 
with our controlling financial interest in the extraction and processing 
of resources into manufactured goods, in tandem with the 
exploitation of cheap local labor (the human resource), which entails 
that an even further enhanced lion's share of the profit realized from 
such endeavors still flows into the coffers of multinational 
corporations based in the industrialized countries.

James Halperin is the author of two books, "The First Immortal" and "The
Truth Machine". "The Truth Machine' describes the development and evolution
of a device which detects conscious deception reliably and rapidly. The
consequences of a Truth Machine are profound and mostly beneficial.

Given the variety of human parameters subject to measurement, such as
breath, GSR, eeg, ekg, blood pressure (the ones used for contemporary lie
detectors), PET scans, voice stress, etc, it seems feasible to begin the
development of a Truth Machine now.

This email list is a beginning, to create a basis of communications among
all interested in this. This is intended to be a long term project, with a
focus on the practical information needed, routing daily professional
communications, discovery of resources and eventually the creation of other
structures (such as an Institue) to foster the Truth Machine.

OTOH, the process DID work. The sniffing resulted in demoloshing the
credibility of the putative cowgirl. The next step up is to incorporate
cryptographic methods, such as signature verification, zero info proofs and
so on. This could be automated and operate in a manner similiar to the
discussion and annotation system available at Foresight.

The whole point is verification and evaluation of reputation. The net is
new, and hasn't evolved effective methods yet. Not that I am hopeful,
embezzlement and fraud are everyday crimes in the world of finance...

Hardly. IMHO, the problem here is abuse of logic.

Define 'single invention'.

The aeroplane was not a 'single invention', although it was conceptually a
unitary transport device; the aeroplane relied on high power-to-weight ratio
petrol engines, developments in aerodynamics pioneered by Lilienthal et al
and followed up by the Wright Brothers, new designs of control system,
the concept of horizontal stabilizers (something most early designs
lacked) ... in short, a whole cluster of inventions that fused during the
period 1901-1910 to give us a working machine.

You can do the same exercise with television, or automobiles, or colour
cinematography, or whatever.

And I'm going to assert that there _are_ just as many, if not more, 
transformative inventions today as there were eighty years ago -- it's just
that they end up being embedded _within_ existing clusters of inventions
so that they're not obviously visible to us. Engine management systems in
cars don't spawn a new 'visible' technological artefact, they improve the
performance of an existing one.

Maybe progress is a fractal process, similar at all levels but looking 
rather boring if viewed from too great a distance?

Robert X. Cringely's current documentary, "The Glory of the Geeks" makes
an interesting point; the first connection between two IMPs exchanged
its first bytes of data just *seven minutes* after Neil Armstrong set 
his foot on the Sea of Tranquility. Which field has made more obvious
progress since that time?

Flip the coin: before 1986, everybody would have answered, 'space travel'.
The internet's technological development was submerged, invisible to most
people. Yet here we are, staring at these green glowing dots on a screen
and talking to people on the other side of the world as routinely as we
used to read the newspapers!

The lesson to draw from this is that not all progress is visible, and huge
changes can occur below the threshold of visibility, erupting into view
only when they're nearly mature. CATS, for instance, _might_ bring your dream
of space colonisation to fruition in a stupidly short period (ten years or
less?) _if_ it hits critical mass with two or more competing cheap,
reusable human-rated launch systems showing up at about the same time as
some source of demand to drive the market. If, say, ROTON turns out to be
a massive commercial success by 2005, it would be wrong to look at the
industry and say 'this is all new stuff since 1998'; its ancestry goes back 
a long time. Just like the internet, which most people seem to think only
came into existence in 1994.

How do you know? You would have to take surveys of people alive from 1899 to
1949 (taking the surveys in 1949) and compare that to surveys of people
alive from 1949 until now. First time I used the internet, it was amazing,
but I don't gasp in amazement every single time I log on today. If someone
asked me if the internet changed my life, I'd say probably, but it's a
routine thing now and I'm accustomed to it. If you asked people about cars
or planes or radios in 1949, they'd probably say about the same thing. It's
hard to define what constitutes a real change in daily life because people
become accustomed to things so quickly. In 50 years when I can cook up a new
pair of shoes in my assembler for 25 cents, I probably won't think much of
it because it will be the fifth time I've used it that day.

I think the scenario you've described above would only work with Weak
SI knowledge, i.e. knowledge that is way beyond our current level of
scientific knowledge but could be acquired by us on our own given
enough time and effort. It is hard to appreciate, by definition, how
completely odd, strange and "beyond" Strong SI knowledge would be. I'm
wondering if any such knowledge might exist because to do so it would
have to be forever beyond our ability to grasp. If we can understand
it (a prerequisite to validating it or not) it would be Weak SI knowledge.
Strong SI knowledge is so strange we can't even speculate what it might
be like other than to say its totally beyond us. Such statements mirror
religious perspectives on divine minds and powers a bit too much for me.
I don't think there is any evidence that would direct us to conclude
that Strong SI is possible. Of course this is the whole problem. The evidence,
Strong SI knowledge, is beyond our ability to appreciate or recognize. Thus,
my original query stands, "How would we ever know a SI was a Strong SI?"

Tangential to this discussion is a scenario I considered 
recently. Since, presumably, an SI should be able to modify
its hardware and software to maximize its information
processing and information storage abilities, it would seem
the most optimal track would be something along the following
lines:

After digesting all of HI knowledge and assessing it with its
own heuristics, the SI would then have to decide what to do
with itself. No doubt, it would identify several paths of
inquiry from its analysis of HI knowledge. It might initially
attempt to determine which path of inquiry would prove most
rewarding (i.e., in terms of assisting it with the other
paths of inquiry). Eventually, the SI would realize the area
that would allow it to maximize its efforts most would be to
determine how to increase its information processing and 
storage abilities.

The SI would then embark on a period of self-modification. The
hope would be the development of a positive feedback loop where
its enhanced processing abilities would allow it to find the
next modifications in quicker fashion. Along the way, this process
would allow the SI to accumulate knowledge about the physical
universe. At some point the SI may be able to reliably determine
how much time it has left, i.e., how long will the universe last
since the solution to that query lays a upper bound/limitation
that would contribute importantly to its evaluation of tasks.

Even with its monstrous processing abilities, the SI might set
for itself herculean objectives that would still entail eons of
calculation and data analysis. Such events as entropy increase,
cooling of the universe, proton decay, etc. may become important
since such events might infringe on the SI's ability to complete
certain inquiries. The SI might develop the capability to initiate
universes on its own, either exactly like our own or optimized
universes geared towards its inquiries.

Its uncertain whether this "Self-Modification Period" would ever
end since only two conditions would appear to lead the SI to
abandon modification efforts: (1) the SI reaches a processing
ceiling that it determines it can not improve upon with its current
knowledge base [at this point the SI would embark on other inquiries
not related to modification and might find some piece of knowledge that
would allow it to return to its modification efforts], or (2) the SI
realizes, unable to create designer universes or unable to create 
designer universes with enough durability, that the time required to
research and implement the next modification would require more time
than it has, wherein it would begin the non-modification inquiries...
rifling through them at amazing speeds [again the possibility exists
that some of these inquiries might give the SI a way to circumvent
the time constraints it faced before].

It seems to me, whatever form this self-modification period takes, that
an SI would gravitate towards it in its natural self-evolution.

This year I missed the Persig Showers which occur mid-August.  I was
disappointed because it is an annual event I enjoy very much.  When I
recently received a Cosmology newsletter that included information about
the Great Leonid Meteor Storm, my enthusiasm for another opportunity this
year picked up.

On Tuesday, November 17, the Earth will cross the orbit of Comet
Tempel-Tuttle, which will sweep up thousands of tons of comet debris made
up of tiny particles of comet dust and grit and will produce a celestial
fireworks extravaganza of "epic proportions in Earth's upper atmosphere."

We may be able to view in dark skies as many as 100-300 meteors an hour
between 12:00 a.m. midnight on Monday 11/16 till dawn on Tuesday 11/16.

It is certainly true that smarter workers are now contributing more to 
growth that larger populations.  But the question is what could create a 
big *change* in that growth rate, and it's not clear we know how to help
people learn much faster.  But there is a potential for enabling much
faster labor population growth.

Granted that as the AI progresses, it can add new items to its ideas list, and
can re-evaluate the rankings of list items.  But this is also true of many of
the other familiar intelligence growth processes (I gave a long list). 
In practice, this rarely has lead to superexponential growth.  Of course there
is always a "potential" for it, but do we have any *arguments* suggesting this
should be different?

I'll grant that this is plausible.  

On reflection, it seems to me that even if most of the big change
genes are fixed at speciation, and even if most of the fitness variance
is explained by these, its still not clear that most of the biological 
innovation happens at speciation.  Speciation may mostly allow previous
potential to be realized by relaxing modularity constraints.  Within
the larger species, a variation must be ready to work with most of the
genes out there.   In the new small species, gene combinations can get
rewarded for working together, even if they each work poorly with other 
possible genes.  Between speciation, the big species collects lots of
possible genes, and combinations of these are tried in new small groups
to see if some combination is a winner.

C.P. Snow has been getting a lot of attention these past few years among
the digerati, the futurists, and biologists.  Brockman's recent book _The
Three Cultures_ boosts the scientists as the new intellectual taking the
place of the literary (the arts).  Futurists, as Naisbitt, are looking at a
meshing of the two cultures of arts and sciences, while E.O. Wilson claims
that the great divide between the humanity is not the arts and sciences but
"between the literate and illiterate."

This past month, while freelancing at a corporation,  I had been in a room
with eight other computer specialists and, like me, artists pulling in
extra money.  Having plenty of time to converse between jobs, I would often
toss out a few transhuman ideas to see if any stuck.  Nine out of ten,
discussions about science were dismissed.  Nine out of ten, science was
thought of as an intruder dominating life and sticking its nose where it
didn't belong.  (I used my own memetic toolkit for spreading transhuman
memes, and I take my own advice: do it carefully because people feel
threatened.)

The long and short is that C.P. Snow wrote about artists not willing to
discuss the Second Law of Thermodynamics, and scientists not able to
discuss Shakespeare.  The difference is that the scientist is not proud of it.

Laurie Anderson, Pop culture icon, performance artist, author, musician,
recently performed "Speed of Darkness" at UCLA's Royce Hall.  In this
musical monolog, she covers the impact of technology while performing
digital processing of keyboards, voice and violin.  The performance was
smooth and clean but lacking in scope.  It rested on the fringes of
technology alarmism and information overload.  It lacked transhumanist
views and extropic conceptions.

Yet, within the smooth and clean piece, she did voice an issue that is
paramount to my thinking.  She said that artists need to find a new
profession now that everyone has Photoshop on their computers (literal and
metaphor).  Yet the difference in our thinking here hinges on limiting the
artist to image maker, rather than creative thinker.  I have been looking
for that new profession for a decade now, thus my own trespassing into the
scientific community, and contemplating a blending of the arts and sciences.

I recently read Gary Snyder's essay in his book _A Place In Space_ in an
essay titled "The Porous World":

"When asked 'What is finally over the top of all the information chains?'
one might reply that it must be the artists and writers, because they are
among the most ruthless and efficient information predators.  They are
light and mobile, and can swoop across the tops of all the disciplines to
make off with what they take to be the best parts, and convert them into
novels, mythologies, dense and esoteric essays, visuals or other arts, or
poems.  And who eats the artists and writers?  The answer must be that they
are ultimately recycled into the beginners, the students.  That's were the
artists and writers go, to be cheerfully nibbled and passed about."

This paragraph is raw and rich and provoking.  It reminded me that yes,
indeed, this is what I enjoy and this is why I learned the "skill" of "art"
-- to develop a keen awareness of the times in which I live and to
integrate what I value into whatever mode works best for me and to feed
that synthesized and nourishable matter back into culture.

We are on the precipice of a new 3rd culture -- one that scoops up
knowledge while being conscious of domain specialization and isolation
thereby.  As we approach discussions and debates, are we making efforts to
open up and blend the skills and specializations to broaden knowledge?

It seems to me that by doing so, I can only add to my own worth both as an
individual and as a participant in the culture of transhumanity.

In software production it is documented that the difference in allmost any
which way you can meassure it (productivity, quality etc.) has a factor of
10 between poor and good programmers, and between experienced and new
programmers.

As more and more parts of the "old" production will be like software
development many of the same mechanisms will step into effect.

Most of the people in the world has little or no education. If there is as
many as 500 millions with higher educations it is probably far to high a
figure. This means that there is perhaps 5 billions that can be far better
educated. Again an improvement factor of ten is possible.

So somewhere between 10-100 times better/more... prodution can be made
possible through education.

Naturally these figures are nowhere near precise but i am convinced that the
general idea is true and that there is room for massive improvement in
production through better education and training.

A factor 10-100 in labour population growth will most likely have some side
effects (economical, ecological...) that are very hard to predict.

Where are the da Vincis, the Rembrandts, the Bach or Mozart, the Homer or
Shakespeare of this age?  Why has modern art degenerated into a test to see
how random or tawdry art has become, and why does modern music sound like
noise even to the teenagers?  Why are modern novels either incomprehensible,
why is modern philosophy incomprehensible, and why is modern poetry boring?

In the old days, the brightest minds of a generation became writers or
philosophers.  Today they are scientists.

In the old days, the poetic souls were drawn to art or poetry.  Today they are
science-fiction writers.

In the old days, the mathematical minds wrote music.  Today they are computer programmers.

There are so many new professions which employ to the utmost human
intelligence, which are so much better paid, that the former occupations of
genius are dying; there are many competent artists, but the great geniuses of
generations have gone elsewhere, and far from science even competence becomes
rare.  Compare science fiction and fiction.  Compare the philosophy of AI with
philosophy.  Compare "Gödel, Escher, Bach" with anything.

Except for schools dying out for lack of intelligent teachers, I see nothing
wrong with this.  Once someone asked me whether computer programming was a
challenge that allowed me to use my talents; I replied:  "There is no limit to
the amount of talent that can be used in computer programming."  If there is
an explosion in the uses of talent, it is no surprise that those areas which
formerly had a monopoly will suffer.

When will the days of art's greatness return?  Perhaps when the sterile
babblings that now inhabit these dead fields peter out, when nobody bothers
with modern art or deconstructing existentialism, when all the writers of
Westerns and singers of rap have starved or moved to flipping burgers at
McDonald's, then we will see more Hofstadters and Feynmans move in to fill the
vacuum.  But these _are_ the days of art's highest flowering, and if you would
doubt it, reread "Permutation City" or "Gödel, Escher, Bach".  Let those who
bemoan the lack of culture in the old and settled lands look to the true
frontiers, the eternal tests of greatness.

You are talking about absolute amounts of growth possible, and I am 
talking about growth *rates*.  People are already working hard to better
train programmers and better educate the world.  It's not clear we should
expect their rate of progress to be any better than it has been recently.

Yes.  So if it's going to happen, maybe we should start to think about it.

Because you haven't read enough modern novels, seen enough movies, or
studied enough modern philosophy?
I find Shakespeare incomprehensible. His writings may have been original 500
years ago but today they are completely trite, and I have no idea why anyone
except a historian of literature or a poseur would find them interesting.
Even a mediocre author like Stephen King can do better then Shakespeare, and
certainly even the worst of Kurt Vonnegut's novels is better then
Shakespeare's best play. The same goes for philosophy. I'm reading
Descartes' "meditations on the first philosophy" for a class and Paul
Churchland's "matter and consciousness" for fun, even disagreeing with most
of what Churchland says, I can't deny that he is making his case ten times
better then Descartes. At least I have to think to refute Churchland. I
could also say that Descartes' is arguing ten times better then Plato, who
was basically laying out dogma.
As for art (painting type art), it depends what you mean by "modern", I
can't say much about art produced in the 1990s, but that produced in the
1920s is overwhelmingly more interesting to me then that of any of the
artists you have mentioned as geniuses. Again, I would rather hang the worst
Salvador Dali painting in my room then Da Vinci's Mona Lisa. Realism takes
talent, but only as much creativity as a camera - which is none. Why would I
want to see a picture of an everyday sight like someone sitting there, when
I can go into a classroom and see hundreds of real live people sitting
there? Even in the small town where I was born, there are two places that
sell paintings by local artists, boring subject matter like mountain scenes
and stuff, each of them displaying as much talent as Da Vinci or Rembrandt.
Of course it's all a matter of taste.

In the old days, there wasn't much distinction between science and
philosophy. Maybe not so much between art and science either, in certain
cases (i.e. Da Vinci)

There is plenty of good art out there and especially lots of great movies,
you're just looking in the wrong place.

I would amend that to say that most proponents of progress are not fondly
revised by present day historians. Since most present day historians are of
the luddite/crunchy/left persuasion, they obviously are applying their biases
to what they write about individuals who were prophets of progress. For
example, the Industrial Revolution, a period which saw the greatest growth in
wealth, health, and education of the largest percentage of the general
population in history, is seen today as a time of backwardness, disease,
exploitation of the working classes, etc.

I think that the time of the kook is upon us. Since it is now generally cool
to be a computer geek, at least among the younger generation (the old school
media are still stuck in the 50's "nerd" attitude rut), I can imagine that the
next wave of acceptance in the next generation is the futurist, especially as
their predictions start to come true at a faster pace.

Social status is still highly rewarded by the arts.  There is no need
for the motivation to be occupation. The inspiration needed to produce
a masterpiece is such a small investment from genius.  Science alone
is social masturbation.  C might evolve C, but masturbation only goes
so far.  Some things in the spontaneous order happen despite evolution
not because of it.  What are you selecting for?  Get out and meet some
folks face to face now and then.  Soap will wash away most of the
foreign body fluids when your done.

[etc.]

Art is obviously in the eye of the beholder. That you happen to dislike
modern art (in the broadest sense of the word), doesn't mean that
it really is less inspired. For example, quality dance (techno/trance) 
music is imho at least (if not more) as enjoyable and intellectually

Dynamic music is a hot topic in the computer games industry.
We don't want soundtracks; we want music that changes according
to what is going on in the game.  If an enemy is on your tail,
the music should get more exciting.  If you lose your wingman,
those ominous bass notes should become dominant.

The Sept. 1998 Game Developer magazine (www.gdmag.com) had an article on
Microsoft's Direct Music (part of DirectX), which is an interactive music
authoring tool, and also on Headspace.  There was an excellent talk
on interactive music at the 1998 Computer Game Developer's Conference
(http://www.cgdc.com), and you can go to their site and find out how to
order the audio tape ($11), or just call 619 483 4300.

  IAN: If you cannot measure no (zero) change, from what
  do you differentiate change? An EPGA is a set of logic 
  gates on a chip with no exact order or structure, but
  what is the FPGA-circuit-definition of change? Also, 
  are we talking here about zero as just a digit or 
  zero as a number representing digit and value? 

  There's no change between all events in all space 
  and time, and all events in all space and time; 
  there is therefore zero change over all. No?

I feel like this misses the point, however.  I personally have been
frustrated by how many good artists with obvious talent focus on the
spreading of entropic memes; while some techno avoids this theme, a great
deal of the stuff I've heard plunges into entropy head first.  :(

The answer to Eliezer's questions, however, is that for most people most of
the time, *science* is the incomprehensible noise.  Entropic art is the way
most people make "sense" of that noise, particularly by using "universal"
(ie ancient) memes.

Imagine what it must be like to never really understand algebra.  Imagine a
world that is utterly "mysterious," (where "mystery" is used in the sense
of incomprehensible "mysteries of God" rather than mysteries to be solved).
 In this world, all of physics is just incomprehensible symbols on a
blackboard.  And really, what's the difference between one set of
incomprehensible symbols and another?  And who's to say they can't be biased?

As for the Shakespeares of our day, it's impossible to be Shakespeare
today, in the same sense that one can't be Newton today.  Harold Bloom of
Yale has pointed out that to some extent Shakespeare tapped into something
so universal, so utterly ubiquitous in human society, that one could even
sensibly say that Shakespeare discovered his work, rather than inventing it
himself; that to some extent even Western authors who wrote *before*
Shakespeare were responding to his work.

Whether or not you believe that, there's no doubting that Shakespeare took
the work that was given him and refined it to such a degree that he very
nearly perfected the forms.  More or less everyone since is either
responding to him or unconsciously reinventing Shakespeare's wheel.
(Again, for comparison, imagine if today's physicists, too sollipsistic to
study the work of those who came before them, would continually rediscover
differential calculus in an attempt to create something "original.")

Anyway, if you're keen on modern authors who are more aware of the universe
around them, I highly recommend you take a look at Thomas Pynchon's
_Gravity's Rainbow_.  However, I also strongly recommend *against* doing so
without a copy of Weisenburger's _Gravity's Rainbow Companion_, as GR
references so much from art, history, science, philosophy, etc. (and some
of it very eclectic stuff) that one really can't understand or enjoy the
book without at least 40 hrs of library research, which Weisenburger has
made somewhat easier.

Thom Quinn (evolu@evolutionary.org) did ask:

>Last week, there was a discussion on the zeroth law of robotics. 
>I once heard of the zeroth law of thermodynamics, but have never 
>seen it listed anywhere. What is the zeroth law of thermodynamics? 

  IAN: The zeroth law of thermodynamics seems 
  circular to me.  It states that if you have 
  two bodies A and B, and the temperature of 
  A = B, and you have another body C, the 
  temperature of which equals that of
  A and B, then A = B = C. Gasp!

http://library.advanced.org/3659/thermodyn/zeroth_law.html 

  My law of zero-temperature says that the 
  temperature of All (such as the whole uni
  verse, all space and time) is zero, since
  the hottest part of All is as much hotter 
  (+) than the coldest parts as the coldest
  parts are colder (-), and this equal and 
  opposite symmetry sums to zero difference.

  This is also true for any subset of All.
  Of the time period covering 24 hours, the
  temperature in a room has points/periods
  that are hotter and that are colder, and 
  the net difference equals zero. Since any
  numerical temperature is measured by its 
  difference from temperature = zero, and 
  since 1 - 1 = 0 and 0 - 1 = -1, net dif-
  ference/temperature always equals zero.

  Everything is a state of difference, 
  and net difference always equals zero.
  This is the Great Void known as Brahman.

  IAN: I don't follow. You imply that there is another 
  definition of change than that which I presented. If 
  you cannot measure no (zero) change, from what do 
  you differentiate change? What is the other de-
  finition of change that you allege to exist?

  Also, as per FPGA, are we talking here about zero 
  as digit or zero as number, i.e., digit and value?

The bovine response that people (even nonscience professors) 
display to science in the face of a "toxic event" is epitomized in the 
Dod DeLillo book  WHITE NOISE.

Yes, but that's like criticizing Leibniz for not also being Lagrange.
Shakespeare is not the last word in English literature, but he is arguably
the first.  Shakespeare is Vonnegut's foundation.  I assure you just about
any "original" plot you try to create, unless you take the modernist
approach of eschewing plot altogether, has already been done before, by
Shakespeare.  Why reinvent the wheel?

Philosophy, however, is a different matter; in this case, I must agree with
you that there's very little in ancient or even more recent philosophy that
can be salvaged... except to the extent that we argue that science is the
philosophy of prediction.

wow!  this was a  very thought provoking post .  thanks!

mr. yudkowsky, you may relate to this story.  when i was in college, my
modern physics professor often referred to hofstadter's escher godel
bach, an eternal golden braid.  being a busy engineering student, i did
not look up the reference at the time, but a year after graduating, i found
a copy and started reading.  it absolutely floored me.  i was so freemed,
i immediately read it again straight thru.  i later decided that of all the books
i have ever read, this one had the biggest impact on me.

recently i wondered about setting up a website where people could
post an answer to the question: "if one book, which, and why?"

i would allow people to interpret the question however they liked,
then answer it.  as i looked into what would be required, it occurred
to me that someone else might have already thought of this, so i
did some surfing and sure enough, such a site already exists.  so,
i looked it over.  out of curiousity, i checked to see if anyone else
had picked hofstadter's escher godel bach, an eternal golden braid.

i found one person had picked egb.  it was the person who
had authored the website!  {8^D

extropians, if one book, which, and why?  spike

thanks for the ideas dennis!  let me propose a different example than
the one i proposed before, which is finding the link between vitamin e
and breast cancer.  this one is weak because only half the population
has em, and only 20% of the internet community, and perhaps 10%
of extropians.

everyone has kidneys, so consider the question of finding the link
between coffee and kidney stones.  (as one who has recently suffered
this malady i am most eager to avoid a repeat.)  the survey would
need only two questions:  1.  how much coffee do you drink (ml/day)?  and
2.  how many times in your life have you had kidney stones?

dennis, is it possible to add this as an experiment to your website?  spike

New Scientist did this in their chrismas '97 issue.  they asked quite a
couple of big names in science (hofstadter included).  EGB was a pretty
popular answer (i think 3 out of the 15 or so chose it).  Can't remember
what DH himself chose.  might try to find it again.

yup.  another approach: try to find the types of questions that folks
wouldnt mind revealing about themselves, and no one would have
much motive to wreck your database.  the example of the link between
coffee and kidney stones has stumped doctors, because you have
opposing effects.  caffiene is a diuretic, so it stimulates urination, so
it encourages thirst and increased drinking of fluids: good,
however coffee also contains chemicals that may produce oxalates: bad.
so is coffee good or bad for kidney stones?

nowthen, most folks dont mind telling how many kidney stones they
have suffered, nor do they mind telling how many javas they quaff,
however, for these data to be interpretable, we would also need to know...
the age of the respondant.  {8-[   which people dont like to tell.

so.  im still looking for a good test case.  spike

Hofstadter picked "The Penguin Dictionary Of Curious and Interesting
Geometry" by David Wells, he was one of the few that didn't pick
"Godel Escher Bach". For me it would be an easy choice, GEB is the
best book I ever read.

As the babyboomers grow older and their bodies starts decaying at a rapid
rate we will see that ecology and love of nature will be replaced with
designer food and smart drugs. Biologist with scientists.

Right now one of the big trends is that of ecology, but even here in Denmark
where we consider ourself to be among the "ecology ambasadors" ecological
food only has an 8% marketshare. At least as many says that they will not
buy ecological foods in pure spite(?) of the ecological movement.

In a few years the ecological movement will settle at some level, but I am
willing to bet that it will not be at a considderable marketshare.

Why bother with sonar when you could map greyscale visual the same
way.  Then you could use sonar strictly for range finding if the
visual was not stereo.  I think someone mentioned before that the
bottom of the feet seem to have a large sensitivity area in the brain
- what a waste, except for when your getting a foot rub, of course ;)

My invention for near current tech augmentation go like this:

vision blocking Video headset - (soon to be replaced with contact lens?)
Stereo cameras on outside of headset
eye focus sensing device - knows current position of focusing muscle
electronic focusing system for cameras

All focusing of the world around you is no longer needed by the
unconscious control of your focusing muscle (medical term anybody?). 
Instead, focusing is done electronically on the "camera side".  Also,
the position of your focusing muscle is compensated for on the
"display side" in real time so that your muscle position becomes
irrelevant for normal vision.  Now, you are free to retrain the
unconscious control of this muscle for some arbitrary other task.  My
favorite choice would be zoom control.  Eventually, you could zoom in
on things as a totally unconscious decision.  The end result is that
we've taken an unconsciously controlled muscle and automated its
normal functionality with current tech, freeing it up for other
utility.  All I want to do, is do a Zoom, Zoom, Zoom ;)

 Seems nice. But I won't use it unless I can easily switch between the
actual feature of eye focus, and the enhanced feature of zooming :)

  Is the brain so plastic?

   For the moment, I would much more easily use glasses with a special
vision set into a corner of it. Plus a mike set into one of my hears,
and a mike in the top of my tie or shirt connected to a portable
phone. We could then contact each other as well as contact our vocal
computer. That gets us nearer to telepathy. (Note: the hackers and
crackers of the system will just be telepaths with a bigger thelepatic
ability .)

I'd bet that if a widely respected Extropian like Hal Finney or Carl Feynman
were to look at a random sampling of people labeled "kooks" by their 
contemporaries in the last 500 years, they'd conclude most of these "kooks"
really were, in Hal's or Carl's favored sense of the word.  Sure among those
millions were people advocating stuff we like, but what fraction of "kooks"
was that?  And how many of the "kooks" advocating stuff we like had good
arguments for their positions?

Having as you do a sense about how both worlds think, you have a good
opportunity to distill the essense of one mindset and explain it to
the other.  I for one am very curious to understand exactly what they
mean by science sticking its nose where it doesn't belong.

It is striking to me how artists, who appear to others as tending to 
lambast the inequities in our world and the tragic losses from competition,
revel in competition in their own world.  They might write plays about 
what terrible things come from someone setting themselves as Gods compared
to others, but those who do this well become writer-Gods whorshiped by 
their minions, and seem quite comfortable with this arrangement.

There is no one book, there is no one discipline of study or interest
centralizing "the" way. 

This was the point of my post.  

Sets of doers, thinkers crossing the boundaries of disciplines and
closed-door specializations, have tremendous influence on our lives and our
future. 

We might be asking ourselves what makes our extropian transhumanity work.
Are we actively watching it unfold?  Hypothesizing from a distance or
emerging into the flow?  Looking for just the right book to read, just the
right film to see, just the right shirt to wear, or synthesizing knowledge,
picking and choosing carefully, the best information across the information
lines.

I agreed with much of what Dan Fabulich said in his post, and especially
appreciate the idea about "tapped into something so universal, so utterly
ubiquitous in human society" that it might not have been invented, but
discovered during the process.


In another post, Dan said:

Extropianism, as well as transhumanism, would not exist without philosophy.

>I write a computer program that increases the efficiency 
>of a company and lowers it's expenses by by 20$. I sell 
>it to the company for 10$. Where is the zero sum? 


  IAN: The zero-sum exists in total, if expenses 
  were 5 (just as a random example) and then they 
  became 2, they were 3 more and now are 3 less, 
  that's 3 + (-3) = 0 difference over all time.

  If the expense of running A (something) is 5 more 
  than the expense of running B (nothing), then the 
  expense of B is 5 less than running A,  which
  means we have 5 + (-5) = 0 total experience.

  Zero expense exists, since the entire universe
  (sum total of all space-time) expends (losses) 
  nothing. Yes, heat is lost, but ONLY by sub-
  sets of All. All is always the same as it- 
  self, and thus the expense of All = 0.

  That is why everything is a zero-sum game. 
  Is this not logical? If not, then how so?

I totally agree.  That's why there's LITTLE to be salvaged, rather than
*nothing*.  :)

Thought you'd never ask! Why yes Spike, the idea of an ongoing medical survey
is one I had considered myself and I have already begun some preliminary work.
I'm just trying to figure out the best way to implement such a site on a long
term basis. By the way far more men develop breast cancer than you might
imagine. Their prognosis is usually poor because, like you, they assume that
only women can get breast cancer. By the time they seek treatment the cancer
has metastastic lesions everywhere. Also many other beverages besides coffee
are implicated in renal stones--soft drinks and tea to name two. I live in the
Southeast where the incidence of stones climbs along with the temperature each
year probably due to the increase in iced tea consumption ( usually peaks out
in mid-July) and in informal surveys that I have done on my unfortunate
patients they confirm a fondness for glass after glass of the stuff.

Life Expectancy Is Up
Areas of the Americas Differ, but Infant Mortality Is Down
By David Brown
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, September 29, 1998; Page Z09

Life expectancy in the Americas has risen nearly four years to 72.5 years of
age since the early 1980s, a trend driven by a steady decline in infant
mortality and, to a lesser extent, by myriad improvements in the health of
adults, according to a new report by the Pan American Health Organization
(PAHO).

The improved life expectancy for North America, Latin
America and the Caribbean, however, masks significant differences between
regions, and even bigger gaps between individual countries. In North
America, for example, life expectancy is 77 years, while in Latin America it
is 70. A nearly 25-year difference divides Haiti (54.5 years) and Canada (79
years.)

Infant mortality, defined as death before the age of 1, is currently 27 per
1,000 births. Major improvements have occurred in Latin America and the
Caribbean, which together have a rate of 35 deaths per 1,000 births, down
from 59 early last decade. In the United States, infant mortality is 8 per
1,000 births.  Life expectancy is the most potent measure of a population's
health, and declines in deaths during childhood have the largest impact on it.

The statistics are contained in a two-volume report entitled "Health in the
Americas," released last week as health ministers from PAHO's member
countries gathered at the organization's Washington headquarters for a
four-day meeting. Founded in 1902 as the Pan American
Sanitary Bureau, PAHO is the oldest international health   agency in the
world. It functions as the Western Hemisphere's branch of the World Health
Organization.  The report contains health reviews of the 45 nations or
territories in the Americas, as well as discussions of subjects ranging from
individual diseases, the water supply and the effects of El Nino to the
hemisphere's  patterns of immigration, laboratory capabilities and  methods
of financing medical care.

  A major force in the improvement of health in Latin  America and the
Caribbean in recent years has been the  expanding access to clean water.
About 78 percent of  people now get drinking water from household
connections or a source nearby. About 70 percent of the population
drinks treated water, compared with only 20 percent a decade ago. Plumbing
is available to 69 percent of the population, although only 10 percent of
wastewater is treated in some way before disposal.

About 3.4 million people ages 15 to 49 were infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS in 1994, according to the report,
and 800,000 cases of AIDS were counted last year. Public health officials,
however, believe the number of AIDS cases may be double the number reported.

The incidence of tuberculosis, a disease in resurgence in parts of Africa
and Eastern Europe, is steady in the Americas. The number of new cases each
year per 100,000 people is 32. This rate, however, varies greatly country to
country. It is highest in Peru, where the incidence
of 174 cases per 100,000 is more than three times that of Latin America as a
whole.

An epidemic of cholera that began eight years ago has subsided. The number
of cases reported last year was only 5 percent of the number reported in
1991, when the infection reappeared after being virtually unseen for a
century. An epidemic of dengue, an occasionally fatal disease transmitted by
mosquitoes, appears to have peaked in 1995 and is in slow decline.

The last case of polio in the Americas occurred in Peru in 1991, and a
campaign to eradicate measles from the hemisphere is underway. In 1996 there
were slightly more   than 2,000 confirmed cases of measles in the Americas,
compared to more than 600,000 a year in the early 1960s.

Progress has been made in the reduction of minor health problems as well.
During the past two decades, the amount of dental caries -- tooth decay --
in children has fallen by 20 to 80 percent in nearly all Latin American and
Caribbean countries, largely as a result of programs to add fluoride to the
water or, in some places, salt.

As in most places in the world, the biggest health threats in the future
will come from noncommunicable diseases, not infections. Deaths from chronic
and degenerative diseases will outnumber those from infectious and parasitic
diseases by a ratio of 10-to-1 in the year 2000, according to the report.
The number of people with diabetes in the Americas is expected to rise
from 28 million in 1994 to 40 million in 2010. The number in Central America
is expected to double during that period.

Perhaps the greatest measure of inequity in the region is the amount of
money spent per capita on health care. For the Americas as a whole, the
average is $240, but the range extends from $9 in Haiti, the hemisphere's
poorest country, to $3,858 in the United States, the richest.

Nevertheless, at a press conference unveiling the report, George A.O.
Alleyne, PAHO's director, emphasized the region's shared interests as much
as its stark differences. "We never use the term donor country in PAHO," he
said. "All countries give, all countries receive." He specifically mentioned
the hemisphere-wide benefit of the eradication of polio and the
near-elimination of
measles. In Latin America, inter-country cooperation has helped advance
everything from a safer blood supply, to more judicious use of pesticides,
to better ethical review of clinical research protocols, he said.

well said natasha.  actually, i have come to depend on the web and my
extropian associates much more than books for the exchange of ideas
crossing the boundaries of disciplines, etc.

please, i value your answer highly, so be a sport.  {8^D  whats your favorite

        Though I am not one to speak against technology in any capacity, it
is my observation that the advent of the computer age seemingly smudged the
lines of what is and isn't "art."  True, art itself is totally open to
interpretation, but the amount of people in the last hundred years who have
called themselves "artists" has drastically increased.  In the centuries
preceeding this one, one who could create within the confines of his medium
would be dubbed an artist; common mediums being oil and canvas etc. for
painters, piano and violin (i.e.: scores) etc. for musicians, disciplined
sonnets and verse etc. for poets, and so on.  However, in this century (and
particularly the past two decades) the mediums have diversified drastically.
Where Da Vinci was once extolled for his Mona Lisa, thousands of people
could easily do a pixel by pixel recreation on 3D Studios or other "art"
programs.
In addition, to create anything in that style (with today's technology) is
not all that difficult.  And yet, the social\cultural hurdle of "art" stays
at the same level.

        The standard for what is and isn't art is nowhere near as high as
it has been in the past.  In modern poetry, any individual can write
*anything* arranged in an interesting form and claim that it is open to
interpretation, and therefore art...regardless of the "poet's" intention.
Another example is with the retail gimmick "Magnetic Poetry Kit" which
contains a certain number of magnetic words.  Feeling inspired?  Why not
"create" a poem with the allotted words?  Commercially acceptable music is
a similar story.  Techno and "alternative" music forms are generally
formulaic: the same beats and the same musical progressions are churned out
over and over again.  How often is a hit song written in a time signature
other than 4\4 or 6\8?  Innovation is not what the majority of people
really want.  People want an unobtrusive medium that the term "art" can be
applied to.  The reluctance to appreciate what is real and true in art
illustrates the tendency towards society's (as a whole) greatest fear: the
fear of individual tastes.

        What the reality of art is is that not everybody can be an artist,
just as not everybody can be a scientist.  There is more to it than just
the outpouring of words, the strokes of a brush or the playing of notes.
Beneath the surface of a true artist there is a fierce conflict between
tragedy and passion, and this war is always being fought.  No matter how
much output a true artist has, he will never be satisfied --never be
content with his accomplishments; instead he will be tormented by the
things he could never quite express.  However, this conflict creates a
drive to *try* to attain the perfect expression of one's essence.  A true
artist will never be able to stop creating for fear of losing the impetus
of expression forever.  Without this drive, the artist will stagnate, and
his desire for his own understanding will be lost.  This, to a true artist,
is death.  However, for a true artist to be successful, the social and
cultural standard towards art --innovative art-- must first be raised.

felicitously named?  thanks!  {8^D  but the moniker wasnt for anticipating

whacking him with a stick, conking him repeatedly with an anvil (clank
clank clank), tries prying the stubborn animal off with a crowbar, all
to no avail.  finally the wolf removes his pants and leaves them behind
with the bulldog still attached.  for this resolute beast i was nicknamed.

An understanding spoon feed to many is the tedious notion that tampering
with biology isn't natural. Tactics include reminders of the Frankenstein
myth, nuclear age fears, while feeding new age spirituality (also Deepak
Chapra notion that our bodies are intelligent and tell us what they want
from a holistic approach).  Also, the reactionary xenophobic fears that
science favors its own awards rather than what is best for society. This
type of information has been feed to the public by doomsdayers of science
coupled with technology.  Pseudoscience is another means to negating the
efforts of science and public recognition of these efforts.

Those of us who actively participate in the community of science are well
aware that the above notions are full of flaws.  Yet, obtaining this
information is not an easy task because those spreading fear tactics get
top billing.  It hasn't been until recently that scientists have been
speaking in a language that can be translated and, and this is important I
think, that scientists are willing to communicate to the public more
openly.  Where it was once considered unprofessional for a scientist to
speak about her or his work openly to the public, today scientists are
doing just this and revered both publically and in the scientific community
for doing so.

Possibly, sheer envy. Those who have a tendency to lambast the world and
then turn on their heels and profit from the very characteristics of the
lambasting, may tend to feel envy.  Later success and recognition in one' s
field can soften the wrangle.

It seems to me that this type of personality profile are issues of behavior
and not a feature of the artist, but of the person.  Similar traits are
readily identified in an angry youth who blasts the corporate world for
capitalism, then ten years later drives a BMW and vacations in St. Martins.
 The anger associated with envy summons up emotions that warrant
expression, thus the baton passes to the artist for his ability to express.
 Such expression sometimes done in reptilian ways rather than ways that
might consider the long-range effects.

* * * * *

The psychology of creative achievement and self-aggrandizement, or even
cultural icons, reaches far back into the bowls of civilization.  Just
today I was at the Getty Museum viewing the sculptures of Greek and Roman
Gods.  How large they stood.  How perfect in body and beauty.

Adjacent to the subject, but interesting in regards to Gods-mongerings:
Scientists such as Newton and Galileo where made into superhuman heros by
some peers, possibly to obtain recognition and money, by myth making
(inspiration flashes by Newton when he saw a falling apple and discovered
gravitation, or an inspiration flash by Galileo when he watched the
pendulum swing in the Pisa Cathedral and discovered isochronism.)

Title
  Independent effects of palatability and within-meal pauses on intake and
  appetite ratings in human volunteers.
Source
  Appetite.  29(1):61-76, 1997 Aug.
Abstract
  The effects of the introduction of timed pauses within meals and palatability
  on food intake and changes in rated appetite during a meal were assessed in
  three experiments in which volunteers ate a lunch of pasta with a tomato
  sauce. Eating was monitored using a disguised electronic balance attached to
  a micro-computer, which also allowed the introduction of timed pauses within
  meals. In the first experiment, 16 subjects were tested with both a bland and
  palatable food (with 0.27% oregano), with eating uninterrupted or with pauses
  after every 50 g consumed during which appetite ratings were completed. Both
  the addition of oregano and the introduction of regular within-meal pauses
  enhanced overall intake. Rated hunger increased in the early stages of eating
  the palatable food in the interrupted condition, and then declined, whereas
  hunger declined throughout with the bland food. Similarly, the linear
  function relating intake to time in the uninterrupted condition was greater
  with the palatable food. In the second experiment, nine subjects ate the
  palatable food with no pauses within meals, with 30-second pauses with
  appetite ratings or with 30-second pauses in a non-appetite task. Intake was
  greater in both pause conditions than when eating was uninterrupted. In
  Experiment 3, the effect of pause duration was investigated in a further 16
  subjects, with either no pause or a pause of 5, 30 or 60 seconds. Subjects
  ate more in all pause conditions than with no pauses, while ratings of hunger
  and fullness suggested that subjects were less satisfied at the end of the
  meal with longer pauses. These data confirm previous work which suggests that
  palatability exerts its effect by stimulating appetite and eating rate, but
  also suggest that the introduction of pauses within meals enhances intake as
  well, contradicting the idea that pausing within meals should reduce intake
  by allowing more time for post-ingestive satiety to develop.

This is true for science too - there are now more scientists in existence
than at any other time in history.

Does this mean that the level of attainment required before one can call
oneself a scientist should be raised?

Artists have been using particular "Styles" since time immemorial. The old
renaisance painters copied each other's styles willy nilly, and even
passed them onto their successors via tutorage. The only difference
today is that it is a lot easier to copy a particular style.

So, basically what you're saying is that to be a "true" artist requires a
particular personality type. This is highly contentious, but I'll let that one
slip by :o).  However,  I think you're confusing being a "true" artist with
being a "great" artist.

Surely, the great thing about art is that anybody CAN do it.  However, the
value of the art is determined by the response it receives when
observed.  Art is only great when exhalted by others, but the extremely
broad (and open) definition of art means that there will be pieces that are
"below par", in addition to allowing an extremely large segment of the
population to call themselves "artists".

>However, for a true artist to be successful, the social and
>cultural standard towards art --innovative art-- must first be raised.

Standard? By what means is this standard going to be measured? Mere
'innovation'?  Novelty?  Difficulty?  All three?  None? Art is far too difficult
to standardise, let alone measure. To "raise the standard" you first need
a standard to raise.  Unfortunately,  there isn't one.

Though I understand where you're coming from, I don't see the solution in
"raising the standard".  I would even venture to ask whether there really
is a problem?

Title
  L-glutamine supplementation of a high fat diet reduces body
  weight and attenuates hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in C57BL/6J mice.
Source
  Journal of Nutrition.  126(1):273-9, 1996 Jan.
Abstract
  C57BL/6J (B/6J) mice are genetically predisposed to become overweight and
  develop hyperglycemia if raised on a high fat diet. The purpose of the
  present study was to explore the effect of dietary supplementation of
  L-glutamine (Gln), an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation, on
  the development of hyperglycemia and excessive weight gain. Groups of 10 age-
  and weight-matched male B/6J mice were raised on one of four diets: 1) a low
  fat, low sucrose (LL), studied separately, 2) a high fat, low sucrose (HL)
  diet alone, 3) high fat, low sucrose supplemented with
  L-glutamine (HL+Gln) and 4) high fat, low sucrose
  supplemented with L-alanine (HL+Ala). Energy intake, body weight, plasma
  glucose and insulin concentrations were monitored over time. We found no
  difference in energy intake per unit body weight between any groups after the
  first 2 wk of feeding. However, the mean +/- SEM for body weight (27.1 +/-
  0.6 g) of the LL group measured at 16 wk was lower (P < 0.05) than that of
  the HL group at 37.9 +/- 1.9 g. Also, after 5.5 mo, the mean +/- SEM for
  plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in the LL group of mice were 6.9
  +/- 0.4 mmol/l and 146 +/- 30 pmol/l, which were lower (P < 0.05) than those
  in the HL group at 10.1 +/- 0.9 mmol/l and 438 +/- 84 pmol/l, respectively.
  Although both amino acids caused a 10% reduction (P < 0.05) in body weight
  compared with HL feeding at wk 16, only Gln supplementation resulted in
  persistent reductions in both plasma glucose and insulin concentrations over
  5.5 mo. In another experiment, when Gln was added to the high fat (HL) diet
  of heavy hyperglycemic animals for 2 mo, body weight gain, hyperglycemia and
  hyperinsulinemia were attenuated. In conclusion, supplementing
  glutamine to a high fat diet reduces body weight and
  attenuated hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in B/6J mice.

Sorry, I could not possibly agree less. This notion that not
everyone can be an artist is a cultural myth, usually promoted by
those who like to call themselves artists, while insisting that you
are not.

I will refer again to the culture of the island of Bali, there the
ability to draw, to paint, to sculpt, to carve, to weave, to sing,
to dance, to play musical instruments, to act, to write poetry, etc
are considered the skillset of every normal individual.

"We have no art, we do everything as best we can."

I remember watching an ethnographic special on Bali, when asked who
he was one of the islands best known "artists" replied "a
fisherman."

A humble artist, try finding one here.....

The discussion about books reminded me of a general concern
I've had of late with regards to my book. I've gone to great
lengths to ferret out all the >H texts I could find. However,
I have no way of knowing if texts not published in the United
States or Europe exist. Damien's "The Spike" is a perfect
example. Had Damien not brought it to my attention, I could
have overlooked it entirely (which would have been a tragedy
because it is an excellent book.)

At this point, I'd like to know from list members if there are
any transhumanism-related books that you would recommend but
may not be published in the United States. If the book is not
available through Amazon.com or listed with the Library of 
Congress, odds are I don't know about it.

I can read German, French and Italian so books not translated
into English are not a necessity (though English versions are
preferred if available). I'd appreciate any recommendations
anyone might have.

As you all probably know, the list has been receiving a lot of spam over the last
few months. The spammers are also apparently sending the same messages to
individual list members. I have noticed that almost all of the recent spams have
included email addresses in the text of the message which are on the juno.com
servers. One reason why so many spammers use services like juno is that it is
easy to set up an email account, and juno's email is also free in many areas of
the country, and pretty cheap in others.

I have contacted juno's 'postmaster' several times in response, but always get
canned automated responses, and there seems to be no actions being taken to limit
spammers from using juno servers. In response to this, I've started taking two
strategies which I suggest others on the list do as well in hopes of finally
getting some sort of respose to remedy the situation. They are based on the idea
that since juno is doing nothing to prevent spammers from using accounts with
them for spamming, that juno is in collusion with spammers who engage in theft of
electronic services (i.e. wasting my time and bandwidth). Considering the volume
of this theft, Juno can fall under the RICO Act statutes.

Strategy 1: Charge fees: As some on the list may know, I charge a $250.00 fee for
processing unsolicited commercial email messages. Every time I receive a spam
which uses a juno account in the body of the message as a response email address,
I send a bill to juno's postmaster for $250.00. Their account balance is now
$1500.00. I've given them three days to refuse charges on each instance, and 30
days to pay the charges, and will impose a 18.5% finance charge for balances due
over 30 days.

Strategy 2: I warn juno in each message that they are in violation of RICO Act
statues by colluding with perpetrators of theft of electronic services.
Apparently, there are means of civil redress under the RICO Act, where a person
or persons can sue violators of the RICO Act. I am currently researching what it
would take to file a class action lawsuit against juno.com on these grounds.
Anyone here is welcome to become in volved in this effort. If you are interested
in getting in on this lawsuit, respond to me at: rico-lawsuit@lorrey.com. Please
provide a zip file with text copies of all spam messages you have received
related to juno.com to add to the evidence files.

Thanks,
Mike Lorrey

Not sure exact understanding is possible in such

essay on this subject that may be of interest is Erik
Davis's "Technoculture and the Religious
Imagination", available at
http://www.ljudmila.org/nettime/zkp4/05.htm

Extropians and "mystical positivism" are even
mentioned in this text, eg:
"... within the frenzied edges of Extropian
technoculture -- Artificial Intelligence, digital
immortality, and the radical separation of body and
mind".

This is not an anti-science rant by any means.  For
example, part of the conclusion notes:
"We all know the neo-Luddites are wrong -- we cannot
and should not escape technology. But neither can we
escape the technologies of the self, the inevitable
problem of how we engineer, direct (and release
control over) our own emotions, intuitions, and
energies, our own qualities of awareness and
imagination. If we abjure one apparatus, we find
ourselves plugged into another, so why not probe and
explore the technologies of the sacred?"

article is also available, in several parts, in the

Refering to skecky's item on depenyl for longevity
and web-based health studies

Use of an HMO database to be the benchmark from which to 
create the blinded cohorts is something I sugested to Dr. Morton
Schulman's asst. for thought when they do a study on deprenyl.

This could convert a double blind study into a single blind study.
Creating a patient profile for the control subjects and then selecting
the comparables from the entire health sevices receiving population
would be much more ethical since no patients who were known to be
potential candidates would be denied access to treatment with potential
efficacy.

We here in Saskatchewan Canada have only one HMO the government run 
Medicare system and are implementing a health information network
which would cover all the medical records of the entire population.

This would be an ideal data management system to use as a platform
from which  to originate "Web based health studies" .

I'm quite strapped for time to give a proper dissertation but felt I had
to contribute at least this bit.

PS.....
We are planning to incorporate a company to produce several
nutraceuticals.  I want to use the name  
EXTROPIAN AGRI-VENTURES .... Any complaints??

What good is this if you will never get paid? They are most likely just
tossing your "bills" in the garbage.
Can you give us the e-mail adress of juno's postmaster? Maybe a good
strategy is for everyone who gets spam from a juno.com adress to forward it
to juno's postmaster.
Does juno.com have a fax number? Maybe faxing them a copy of the spam,
followed by 100 or so sheets of black construction paper (1 sheet ran
through the machine 100 times) would bother them enough to do something
about it. 
If they don't have a fax #, they might at least have a 1-800 number, which
could be called several hundred times per spam message. How much does it
cost to receive a 1-800 call?

Thanks for the tip Joe! I went ahead and ordered this, it was back
ordered so they said it would be about two weeks. I'll report back

I finally did some formal economic analysis of the 
implications of machine intelligence (uploads or AIs) for 
economic growth, wages, and population.  The analysis
confirms and illuminates simple intuitions.  

----------------------------------------------------------------
      Economic Growth Assuming Machine Intelligence
       http://hanson.berkeley.edu/aigrow.pdf , .ps
                 by Robin Hanson

A simple neo-classical growth model examines the implications 
of machine intelligence, machines which could substitute for, 
rather than complement, human labor.  Steady state growth rates 
could easily rise by an order of magnitude or more.  But with
steady growth, wages and per-intelligence consumption could fall 
as fast as computer prices do.

If it doesn't cost me too much (preferably notning), and there 's a profit
to be made, count me in...How much, if any, money could be made
from this action? Would be nice to have some cash for a change...
