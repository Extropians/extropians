Currently, robotics does not provide us with machines capable of robust 
navigation, vision, etc. AI is a somewhat unfortunate term, since it is 
still loaded with strong AI things like Lisp workstations, expert 
systems, inference engines & the like. This is brittle stuff which has 
nothing to do with robust robotics.

Furthermore robots are far from being cheap. They do not autoreplicate.
On the other hand, they are tireless & accurate (no labor's union 
membership, too) if it comes to doing well defined, tasks requiring little 
sensorics nor complex realtime processing of input. Most are still 
dedicated automates, not all-purpose reprogrammable robots. Statistics 
lie, sometimes.
 
But you just can't trust idiots running a car assembly line. (This is not 
a 3-banana problem).

Hmm, I failed to notice a dramatic increase in the use of robots just 
lately. Manual labor has still a fair niche. Only large hardware ANNs 
will change this situation, and these are unlikely to appear too soon.

You know, most people don't like being unemployed. Trivial things like 
housing, food, clothing, and such. They might get pissed sufficiently to 
start an insurrection. There are some areas in Krautland with 15% 
unemployment, trend's still up.

I know a bit about DNA tinkering, and I think this damn unlikely. This is 
one of the reasons why I don't fear genetically modified organisms 
release in ecosystems _which are in equilibrium_. Alas, most things 
humane are not. Woe! Fear the engineered virus. Welcome to Project Blue.

If they are sufficiently smart to operate the machinery, they sure are 
smart enough to feed themselves.

This is pure slavery, of course. Tinkering with human DNA to produce a 
race of slaves is immoral as hell, imo. Currently, _any_ tinkering with 
human DNA is a strong no no since the yield is so low. Site directed 
mutagenesis or DNA snipping/insertion is easy on bacteria where you 
select automagically e.g. by ampicillin resistancy, but just try this on 
human embryos. 99.999 % nonviable. Hoo, boy.

Subject: Philosophy of Mind Bibliography - New Web Site

A revised and expanded version of my philosophy of mind bibliography
is now available at a new location.  The URL is:

  http://ling.ucsc.edu/~chalmers/biblio.html

The new version has about 2300 entries.  Every section has been
reorganized to some extent, especially the first section on
consciousness.  The density of annotations has dropped off somewhat
due to a lack of time, but fortunately modern search tools make
keeping up the listings themselves fairly straightforward.  I've
enclosed a summary below.

My own home page has also moved to:

  http://ling.ucsc.edu/~chalmers/

and there is a web page for my book THE CONSCIOUS MIND at:

  http://ling.ucsc.edu/~chalmers/tcm.html

Please update any relevant links, as the old Washington University
pages may not stay around forever.

That's true, but I don't think bipedalism can claim credit for our good 
endurance, it's because we're much better at getting rid of waste heat than 
any other large mammal, and that's  because we have sweat glands on every   
part of our skin, and that's because we don't have a permanent coat of hair. 
One of our first inventions must have been the coat, when it's cold we put it 
on, when it gets hot we take it off, other animals must ware their coat all 
the time. I doubt if Lucy was smart enough to make a coat, so she was probably 
very harry and didn't have the endurance of modern humans. Then again, I would 
have predicted that she would have a hand much inferior to ours, and I would 
have been dead wrong about that, so who knows.

Maybe, but if it means you can see a saber toothed tiger better over the tall  
grass it also means that the saber toothed tiger can see you better too, and  
he's a lot faster and tougher than you are. Anyway apes can walk for short  
distances on 2 legs, long enough to get a good look at things if they want to,  
no need to go to the ridiculous extreme we did. 
                    

                >two free arms to throw rocks with and carry things.                 


Maybe, but apes can and do carry things in their arms without becoming  
bipedal like us.

Maybe, but it seems to me that bipedalism would be better in a dense jungle 
than an open savanna where speed is all important. On the other hand it 
evolved at a time when the climate was getting dryer, the jungle was  
shrinking and the savanna was expanding. Go figure.

But the hands of modern apes are good enough for that, they do it constantly,  
but that's not what they're best at, they were optimized for locomotion. 
Lucy using her delicate hand just to pick up bugs seems like tremendous 
overkill to me, but maybe.

Maybe, but some of aquatic animals have a lot more hair than we do, beavers, 
otters, seals.  Being a biped is no advantage in swimming, many mammals are 
much  better at it than we are and they never came close to developing 
anything like it. It might be a slight advantage in wading, but not much. 
It's very difficult to walk in water over a foot deep for any distance,
almost impossible if it's over 2 feet deep, especially if you're only 4 and a 
half feet tall as Lucy was. Anyway it's hard to see why a slight advantage in 
wading would be important enough to justify such a radical change in body 
structure.

Maybe, William H Calvin wrote a book about this theory called "The Throwing 
Madonna", I found it unconvincing. Following a moving object with your eyes 
and then coordinating the muscles in your arm so that you can propel an   
irregular shaped object at it takes split second timing and a lot of brain 
power. Even modern humans would have a hard time making a living by throwing
baseballs at running animals, much less irregular rocks, and they have a much  
bigger brain that Lucy did.
                        

                > [ maybe Lucy made ]  Wooden spears or uncut rocks?
                        

But a wooden spear would be harder to make than a simple stone tool, and 
without bone or stone tools to help you, almost impossible to make. I don't 
consider an uncut rock to be a tool, a tool needs to be made, but she may 
have used rocks for  something, although I have no idea for what.

Jobs will need to be eventually of the information & research type ONLY, due
to the lack of grunt labor jobs. This will probably be one of the steps in
the years pre uploading when jobs will move from grunt labor type to
information & research type. The people with the brains will survive and
people who don't have the brains to keep up will end up homeless
unfortunetly. Unfortunetly many people won't have the brains to survive the
21st century. You will see alot of people getting REALLY smart REALLY fast
in order to survive in a world where if you don't know all the little
technical details someone will screw you over.

Why? Combination bio & tech could enable many more elements into the genetic

So far they have been able to nearly cure hemophillia and that "bubble boy"
syndrome. One kid was a hemophilliac and the other had that syndrome. So
they infected them as a fetus and allowed the virus to spread through their
system, replacing a single gene in each cell.

SPONTANEOUS GALAXIES


A comet makes its way through the vast forbidding void
A simple rock of ages -a flaming asteroid
An aimless path is made to the soul that it must find
Foreign to the body, familiar to the mind

Why not walk a mile on two forgiving legs
Relieve your eyes of the black box give them the freedom for which they beg
Look to the stars and rid your bones of their unease
See the distant symmetry of colliding galaxies

Let your spirit soar to where the light of day runs dry
Where Haley has no comet, Gallileo no 'magic' eye
Feel your heart pound like the chorus of interstellar starbursts
Where spontaneity is the key to great discoveries and firsts
Fly on lucid wings that could never be seen
Be the spatial paladin that none have ever been...

Your heart is your solar rationality
Gives you strength to hide the stars from those who try to see
Guide your own way to celestial love
Let the celerity of being lead you to beyond and far above

Let your spirit soar to where the light of day runs dry
Where Haley has no comet, Gallileo no 'magic' eye
Feel your heart pound like the chorus of interstellar starbursts
Where spontaneity is the key to great discoveries and firsts
Fly on lucid wings that could never be seen
Be the spatial paladin that none have ever been...

Space may have a limit if logic is not true
The answer of the cosmos lies deep inside you
The world may have no meaning but don't let that thought deter
You can create your own destiny -ride that far off meteor

I'm delurking here on one of my pet topics ... :-)  Greetings to all!

In message <1.5.4.32.19960828131135.00667fe0X1@pop.dial.pipex.com>,
Sarah Marr summarizes well many of our statements on UIF, and adds:

Actually, I don't recall anyone suggesting such opprobrium in the context
of UIF, although UIF was left loosely defined on purpose.  The UIF that
we carved out originally on the >H list certainly voiced no such value
judgement, and my own >IF doesn't do so either since acceptance without
agreement is the norm in the totally subjective view of the world in >I.

Although I don't see any opprobrium being expressed anywhere in the
UIF threads, even if it was, it wouldn't matter:  only in a community
with jurisdictional controls does personal expression of opprobrium
turn into coercion.  In a world where people have the means to defend
their individual freedom (such as in the nanotech scenarios, but there
are others as well), I doubt if opprobrium will be a significant player.

You're totally right to say that a dynamic IF can never be abbrogated,
but then that applies to all shades of IF, since they're all dynamic.

I think Natasha's assessment hits the mark in this area:  these shades
of individual freedom are really all one and the same in their most
important aspects:  they're all inherently dynamic, because all static
systems imply limits (usually jurisdictional) and none can support the
needs of self-transformation across an infinity of threads of individual
development in the transhuman diaspora.  Indeed, that is why I *defined*
individual freedom to be dynamic --- nothing else meets the requirement.

[Come to think of it, maybe I can see Anders' point ... ;-}]

It's quite a serious matter though ... it would be terrible to belong to
the last generation before mankind liberates itself from the sell-by date
hardwired into us by evolution.  Previous generations didn't have even the
possibility presented to them so they couldn't agonize about missing the
boat.  It's different now though.

Is there any reason to suspect that the electric field is at all
interesting beyond the normal bonding distances?  I haven't seen it
discussed anywhere.  What sparked your interest in this, Sarah?

Well, "sloppy in its authorship" is a bit hard.  Admittedly, you coined
the phrase but didn't define the concept, but that isn't necessarily
sloppy.  You left it to the rest of us on the >H list to define it, and
that was surely good for the subject matter and for the community.  Our
work didn't take the path you expected, it took the path that those that
worked on it determined, which can't be a surprise to anyone.

If you want an ideology that meets your own requirements exactly, I'm
afraid you're going to have to develop it yourself, Natasha!  (:-)

For the benefit of those that didn't follow the numerous threads on
this subject over many many months on the other list, the disagreement
over direction was resolved in a manner totally in keeping with the
spirit of UIF:  I placed the form of UIF in which all value judgements
are entirely subjective into my personal memetic pigeonhole labouring
under a banner of "TransIndividualism" (>I), a totally individualistic
ideology based on scientific empiricism on the objective side plus an
axiomatic base of TransIndividualistic Freedom (>IF) on the subjective
side.  This has extended my freedom while not reducing that of others.
(The only downside is that it leaves my tongue in knots. :-)

That left the label "UIF" available for redefinition by those that did
not feel comfortable with a world in which there can be no objectivity
in matters of value judgement.  As it happens, nobody has picked up that
gauntlet yet, which is a great pity --- I'd love to debate it.

Rich.

To compute resonances of caged neutal atoms perhaps?

There is some work on attaching ancillary structures to C60 or C70,
which may lead to methods of attracting and trapping selected atoms 
or small molecules ( e. g. heavy metals). The electric field structure
is central  here.

I don't see why, I was referring to myself and that is how I see it.

I did develop its concept as I saw it at the time.  You just didn't agree
with it.  You asked me for a definition, while I stated that I did see how
it could be defined in that I was beginning to doubt its significance or
purpose, i.e., superfluous adjective.

Not define it completely, but to explore it.

Not exactly.  It took several paths, as so expressed by the number of people
who participated in voicing views.  Some I agreed with, others I did not.

Gee thanks Rich!  But, no, I don't have to develop an new ideology, I am
already a Transhuman Extropian. And, I'm quite happy with that now. I can,
however, develop _myself_ and this action brings me great joy.  I'm
automorphing my individual freedom.

I dunno - I see a lot of roles for humans augmented with mechanical
parts for robot-type labor. See my tongue in cheek net.prophecy.bulletin

True. I'm not saying a huge segment will become obsolete. They'll only find
short-lived niche jobs lacking a steady paycheck forcing them to endlessly
look for work, going from job to job to job. The rest will become homeless
but most will go the information/research career route and the niche jobs
will hopefully be only for the fringe.

Let them eat cake. :) No, there would be a rebellion so we must develop
memes to cram more info into the shallow minded. How about a Stacker meme to
run on the brain and compress information? :) Here is an idea. We should
list all the things (ie. trances) you can do by concentration and thinking
as well as techniques that make memes highly contageous (sp?) and then
create a meme such as the Gaia theory with an extropian twist to spread
extropianism like a religion across the globe. Could work!

Should we abolish the copyright law? If we say no it is against the anarchy
we believe in. The copyright law is mucho dificil (very difficult) to
enforce since it is broken millions of times a day quickly and easily. So
are we going to side with Wired magazine believing all information is free
or or we going to side with the scientologists who wish to strictly enforce
the copyright law even though it is unlikely maybe even impossible.

It would be a blast for sure. I will notify you all in a future post.

Subject: Anon.penet.fi is closed!

Due to both the ever-increasing workload and the current uncertain legal
status of the privacy of e-mail in Finland, I have now closed down this
service until further notice. For now, you can still mail NON-ANONYMOUSLY
to existing anXXXXX@anon.penet.fi users using the naXXXXX@anon.penet.fi
address convention, so that you might establish another way to communicate
with people you only know by their anon.penet.fi address, but news postings
and anonymous mail is not supported. 

To use the non-anonymous forwarding service, you have to modify the anon
address by swapping the first two letters (an to na, standing for Not
Anonymous), so that an123456@anon.penet.fi becomes na123456@anon.penet.fi. 
But remember that your address will *not* be removed - this method is only
intended as a stop-gap to enable you to establish another way of communicating
with the people you only know by their anon.penet.fi addresses. 

If you feel that the service has been valuable, you can send a letter of 
support to support@anon.penet.fi, and likewise, if you feel it is a good
thing the remailer has gone off the air, you can use the address
against@anon.penet.fi to outline your reasons. As people always ask me
why anyone would need a service such as anon.penet.fi, I am collecting
case stories at why@anon.penet.fi.

I have now maintained this service for over 3 years, and as there have
appeared a number of other similar, reliable and well maintained servers,
I feel we have reached a situation where the current anon.penet.fi
server can be retired. Thank you for a very interesting time on the net!

True, it does not have to be binary, rather to extreme ends of the

If you have changed your cognitive abilities, especially size and 
speed, it will be quite unlikely that you have the same values and 
definitely not the same identity.

Exactly.  If you are growing continously, the only thing that the 
remains constant is the act of growing.  This is exaclty why I hold 
that "I" is a process, not a thing.

As you say, there is no way of answering this question.  A pratical 
solution is to ask: "What will be the effect on my life if I believe 
that I`m living in a virtual world?" If you like the results, go for 
it.  I prefer to think that we are living in a virtual world, and I`m 
discovering the keys to manipulating it from the _outside_.  
Again this has no relevance to objective reality (whatever than 
means),  it only makes life a little more interesting.

In contrast, studies have shown a link between consciously perceived 
male T-shirt odors and the preference of women (who are not taking oral 
contraceptives) for the odors of men who are most genetically diverse.

Given proposed correlates between steroid hormone metabolism and one's 
pheromone signature, it appears that there may be 
genetic-hormonal-pheromonal correlates to differences in human mate 
choice. As Brad implied, it is less likely that dietary influences on 
consciously perceived odor differences will be correlated with mate 
choice.

Either that, or learn how to build fortresses. And I think most us prefer 
to avoid that. 

The big problem is that regardless of how good we are at memetic 
distribution, there will be differences that grow exponentially. What we 
truly need, is an ethics, a society, a system of being that can handle 
extreme differences between people - not just in wealth, but also in 
knowledge, goals and form of being. 

But spreading good memes are always a good idea. [Exercise for the

Not necessarily as a religion (but Church of Virus is working on that),
but as a good idea. I think the self-help memes could be combined and
enhanced in some ways. 

A sketch of good "meat" for the meme:

Creativity techniques (questioning assumptions, using random objects in 
new combinations, etc)

The idea that you can control your mental state and growth (which is 
*very* subversive to many people)

Mindmapping, mnemonics etc: "Our brains are trees or webs - use it!". 

A sketch of useful hooks:

Good for you, will help you (we tend to do things that are good for us, 
and try to help our friends by giving them the idea)

Cool (Some memes give social standing to those who follow them)

Funny.

Ideally, this meme or meme-complex should be compressed into a slogan, 
which can spread and open up minds to the main meme complex (a bit like 
how a virus enters a cell).

Exactly. And this will no doubt cause some interesting social effects. In
a sf story I read a *long* time ago, there was a mention of the period
just before immortality became practical - the entire world knew it was
coming in a matter of months, and people lived very carefully, almost in a
state of hopeful meditation (except for some, who celebrated it by risking
their lives "for the sake of all who died before us"). 

In an immortal population, the ability to handle change will determine 
age-stratification. People who cannot adapt will remain in their own 
generation-culture, forming an ever growing set of relatively static 
cultures, while more flexible people will form their own system. The 
differences will become noticeable after a certain time.

Well, the efficiency of gene therapy is still a bit uncertain (problem: 
get a virus into *every* relevant cell, insert the gene and don't do any 
damage to them). In the above cases it is just a single gene fix.

Creating the mindless drones could plausibly be done by mimicking some 
natural birth defect; I would be very surprised if there are no genes 
that could be toggled to cause the development of higher cortices to 
stop. The problem is to do this well, without creating either a 
decerebrated being (at best vegetable, at worst incongruently violent) 
or a very dull person (a victim). This is one reason I think there are 
better ways to solve work problems.

Information is not free.  Energy is invested to create new 
information, it follows that information like energy can be bought 
and sold.  You would offend a lot of authors by telling them, their 
work has no value and should be duplicated without compensation.  
Unless authors and other creators of information receive 
substantial once off payement for their work, after which it can be 
copied.

It is a problem to enforce the copyright laws, but that doesn`t 
automatically mean that they should be abolished.

We, of course, aren`t programmed and don`t respond to such base sub-

The source of Cyc's power is shallow reasoning on a huge database. The

top-notch knowledge engineers were necessary to encode daily trivialities.
This is unlikely to be reverse engineered soon, imo. Afaik, a crippled PD

	I haven't the slightest idea of where this logic comes
from....All the great libertarian economists from Herbert Spencer, to von
Mises, to Milton Freidman have shown that the masses would prosper under
laissez-faire....it is Statism that grinds them into the dirt.

I had always accepted the view that patents and copyrights were
but the legitimate extension of property rights into the realm
of 'ideal objects.' However, some arguments by Tom G. Palmer and
Benjamin Tucker (among others), have convinced me that
copyrights and patents are not forms of legitimate property
rights, but of illegitimate state-granted monopoly.    

These ideal objects are non-tangible economic goods. They
include such constructs as ideas, databases, algorithms,
computer programs, music, literature, etc. They differ from
tangible property in that they can be infinitely multiplied
without concomitant lessening of size or quality.  They remain
economic goods in that they are scarce-someone must produce them
and they are valuable.    

Intellectual property rights in the US fall into several
categories: patents, copyrights, and trade secrets for example.
Trade secrets protect ideas but rely upon private measures, not
state action, to maintain exclusivity.  This in contrast to the
non-contractual protections characterizing patents and
copyrights.     

The 'publicness' of a good, which allows free-ridership, is not
an inherent characteristic but a function of the manner it is
produced, marketed, or even of the relevant unit in which the
information is imbedded. Further, costs of exclusion are
involved in the production of all the goods I can think of. Why
single out some goods and insist the state underwrite their
production costs via a state-sanctioned collective action, all
because of the decision to make the good available on such a
non-exclusive basis that it is converted from a potential
private good into a public good.     

Is it right to create property rights whenever the specter of
freeridership arises? Magicians embed their intellectual good
within illusions. To reveal the trick enables consumers to
produce their own illusions. Yet, if they decide to appear on
TV, some viewers might use the slo-mo feature of their VCR to
'free-ride'. Should we create property rights in illusions and
restrain VCR owners from using slow-motion?                     
               
Markets for ideal objects can and do function in the absence of 
enforceable intellectual property rights. Fashions, business
strategies, scientific principles and math formulas, jokes,
magic tricks, new words and slogans are all examples of ideal
objects unprotected in the U.S.    Also works on which
copyrights have expired or were never applicable (such as the
Congressional testimony of Lt. Col. Oliver North).    

In addition functioning markets existed for foreign authors in
the U.S. in the 19th century. The free market paid royalties to
British authors even though those authors received no copyright
protection in the US until the extension of copyright protection
to foreigners in 1891. The American publishers paid the royalty
in order to obtain advance galleys, even though they themselves
had no legal protection against competitors who could legally
copy their new releases and sell them. In the absence of state
protection the authors and publishers used several voluntary and
contractual arrangements for the internalization of
externalities.    

The problem shifts to being one of marketing. Although current
publishers so used to operating with a copyright may think this
analysis strikes at the foundations of the publishing biz, it is
aimed at the present selling methods.

American laws over intellectual property are rooted in the
English patents and copyright system. The Crown issued patents
for new inventions with the aim of securing control of endeavors
thought to be of political import; or to raise money through the
granting of monopolies. Copyright served to ensure state control
over the press in an era of tremendous political and religious
dissent. As Tom Palmer remarked in his recent paper on
Intellectual Property, "Monopoly privilege and censorship lie at
the historical root of patent and copyright." Many times the
state granted monopoly privilege with no concern for the
original inventor. Venice in 1469 (One of the earliest patents I
could find) granted to John of Spyer a monopoly over the art of
printing itself. Queen Marys' chartering of the Company of
Stationers in 1557, granting its monopoly over printing, was an
attempt to control a new, threatening technology, primarily to
suppress Protestantism.     

I stress here I do not condemn the current theoretical arguments
for intellectual property rights on the basis of its'
unwholesome historical origin. I point out its' genesis to
counter the myth that patents and copyrights arose from the
mists of historical common law.                     

Any service or good has, as a component of its' cost of
production, not only the costs of labor, marketing, capital,
etc., but also the cost of exclusion. For the owner of a movie
theater, these exclusion costs include paying for walls, ticket
windows, ushers. These serve to exclude or fence out
'freeriders'. Now they could set up projectors and show the
movies on low level stratus clouds (ok, screens in parks), and
then attempt to prevent casual passerbys from watching. The
method of marketing their product is their choice. In the case
where their marketing decision results in the publicness of a
good, it seems to me to be grossly unjust to ask the government
to force all who might potentially see the show without paying
to kick in some bucks, whether they DO in fact see the show or
not. Or to force passerbys to don glasses that prevent them from
viewing the movie. Yet the proponents of property rights in
ideas choose such a method when they attempt to get every person
purchasing a blank tape to pay a royalty to a third party.
Alternatively, as with DAT tape recorders, their proposals seek
to ban or cripple entire technologies. This method, done in the
name of preventing technologies which are capable of recording
publicized (broadcast) music without loss of fidelity, would
make mere ownership of tangible property (DAT recorder) a crime.
I view proposals for such an implementation of property rights
in ideas, which wipe out other areas of property rights
altogether, as inconsistent.

If we privatize the enforcement of contracts, let those who want
to "own" ideas pay for the enforcement of that contract.  Market
forces will probably lead the computer programmer to tie a
perceived value to the registration of their program (cheap upgrades,
technical support, etc.); rather than paying for a protection agency
that tries to police the digital information realm.  But they would
be welcome to try to enforce a contract against copying a program
that the purchaser would sign when he buys the product.  I just
wouldn't subscribe to a protection agency that used some of my
subscription fee to police copyright protection.

        > Should we abolish the copyright law? 

IAN: All rights are theories. We adopt and enforce various rights because
they serve to promote human progress. Just as physical property rights
encourage the development of physical properties resulting in societies
rise from pre-capitalist conditions, in the same fashion intellectual 
property rights serve to encourage development in ideas and images, 
which are vital features of human progress.

Therefore, copyright protections should be encouraged.

If we say that we should have no copyright law because we should have 
no laws, i.e., no rules, then we have made a rule; ergo, that line of
reasoning falls apart. There are laws and rules. One of them is that
people will not invest in the creation of ideas, images and technology
without a guarantee that they will be rewarded by the protection of
their inventions / investments. That is a spontaneous law of human
action that we need to honor by copyright protections.

Thank you Rich.  This "insight" is the result of taking the time by myself
to think carefully about the subject, come to my own conclusion (which I had
not done up until now) and then bounce it off of some erudite listeners.

In the 21st century Welfare State, 5% of the population will get really
smart really fast.  They and their machines will feed, clothe, house, and
entertain (the next big entitlement) everyone else.

The good news is that as the smart get smarter, the productive will get
more productive. It will become easier to just pay off the laggards -- each
really smart person will be able to sustain millions of them.

So, I don't think we have to worry about people not adapting.  They already
are. <g>

The problem with copyright law in cyberspace is that it is a losing
proposition.  It's only going to get easier for people (and machines) to
copy and distribute information in an anonymous, untraceable manner.  This
is why the only people who believe in the Clipper Chip are gov't policy
wonks who still believe in a command economy, and why e-cash will force the
IRS to become the largest consumer of assault weapons.

My solution is to disallow copyright laws in cyberspace, but maintain them
in realspace.

as I understand it, the Big Bang (if true) means either that the universe
will continue expanding until thermal density (?) goes to zero, or it will
recollapse.

My question: do extropians necessarily believe the universe will reach a

like to believe, will we conquer this universe and just move on to the next
one?

        It would not be a pretty sight if we were to abolish the copyright
law...especially for the one who has the copyright.  If the copyright law
were to be removed then the 'rightee' would have no real claim to his work.
The fact that the 'rightee' knows that it was he who did the work in the
first place provides some solace, but not a lot.  The problem of royalties
arises (pardon me for my present-day capitalistic views), and the 'rightee'
stands the risk of not being acknowledged for his work.  If it doesn't
belong to the *creator* of the work, who does it belong to?  Society?  I'm
sorry, but that sounds pretty socialist to me --no offense to socialists of
course.  The copyright law ensures the security of the individual(s) who
created something.
Frankly, I don't see anything wrong with that.

Shit! Scary stuff. And we wonder why there are militias?

I agree with this also. We could use cryptolopes (a file with public-key
encryption which u need the randomly generated pass to open) to allow the
selling of software over the net and have the codes to use the software
encrypted into windows 95 registry upon installation but not shown to the
user. I say all info should be free in cyberspace except stuff like webzines
and news which are continually updated and brand new software which you can
make a profit off of because it is difficult to obtain right off and another
source of profit for the programmer would be private industry due to all the
licenses.

That's true. If the Big Bang is correct then one day we must see either 
infinite expansion, thermal equilibrium, and the heat death of the universe,  
OR, infinite temperature, infinite density, and the collapse of the universe.  
The only way to decide which of these events will happen is through experiment,
Philosophy can't help us here. 

Tipler argues, correctly I think, that IF true immortality is possible, and 
not just living an astronomically long time, THEN  the universe must  
re-collapse. Immortality is defined as the ability to have an infinite number 
of thoughts. If the universe  collapses in the way Tipler describes then the  
amount of usable energy available to life will keep increasing without limit.
Also, because the universe would be shrinking, the components of a mind would 
keep getting closer together, and so would keep getting faster, and keep doing  
so without limit. Time may come to an end someday but it doesn't matter  
because subjectively it will ALWAYS be infinitely ( and not just very large)  
far away.

Do you mean that a potential for language ability developed long ago,

The question is: had there not been mammals around when the dinos were
wiped out, could the birds have radiated to fill the gap, and followed
a similar trajectory to our position within a hundred million years?
If yes, this is not a hard step.

If hands were so hard, why did they happen so soon after brains were
near ready to use them?  Or ask the same question about bipedalism.
And if you take a long view, graphing encephalization on a log plot
over a hundred million years, growth really is roughly steady since
the dinos were killed.

Without big brains, the ability to sweat probably wouldn't have got us
far.  So the hard thing to understand is, if sweating is so hard, why
did it happen so fast after the big brains arrived?

        If this were to happen, potential criminals could get the message
that it's okay to steal rights from another person on the net, but it's not
okay to steal off the net.  What exactly is the difference between on and
off the net?  Stealing is stealing.  If I, E. Shaun Russell, am going to
post a poem somewhere, I like to know that potential criminals may be
deterred by the law.  Whether or not the law is widely enforced is of little
consequence.
If someone reads 'the author requests that you contact him before you take a
copy', then the average person would probably do so.  If there is nothing on
the page that identifies the author's requests, they may accidentally be
broken.  Hence, the copyright law.  The fact that the law is in place can't
hurt anyone.

I think it will benefit of each of us to spread the Extropian memes to all 
people on Earth.  Not necessarily to have everyone identify themselves as 
"Extropian," but to have everyone working dilligently on increasing the amount 
of intelligence, creativity, happiness, etc. in their lives; all of the 
Extropian Values.  To infect someone with a meme, the meme must have qualities 
which help it to flourish in the individual's current memetic system.  There 
are no "one meme fits all" in memetic competition.  To really be effective at 
spreading our memes, we need to gain a deep understanding of people's belief 
systems, so that we can design memes that work WITH their belief systems, to 
transform them into something more Extropian.  It would be helpful for many of 
us to infiltrate various major world religions, gain an understanding of the 
people's psychology, their belief systems and so forth.  Then it would be good 
to write a few books, aimed at the people in the particular religion, written 
as though they are by an "insider" of the religion, but with the Extropian 
Values seamlessly mixed in with the traditional religious memes.  One way to 
do this is to highly emphasize the memes of the religion which are the most 
Extropian (such as, "God helps those who help themselves.") and ignore or 
downplay those which aren't.  The books need to be very compelling to the 
people in these religions so that they become widely read by the members of 
the religion and deeply embedded.
	The point is not to convert everyone into born-again Extropians, but to help 
adjust people's belief systems so that they are *MORE* Extropian than they are 
now.  Infiltration and Subversion are winning tactics in memetic "warfare".  
	Also, books which show the deep similarities between various religions are 
good to popularize among the members of the various religions, because it 
helps to lessen their attachment to the particular religion they're associated 
with and gets them to think more about common ideals and values than their 
superficial differences.  Just focusing people's minds more on the value level 
is good for Extropianism, because I think most, if not all, people value 
increasing their intelligence and happiness and so forth, and the clearer they 
are with themselves about their values, the more they will act according to 
those values and seek out information which will help them achieve their 
ideals.  If the more Extropian information tends to be more effective in 
helping people achieve their goals, then they will more consistently seek out 
Extropian information.

        Some might say that this poem is not really transhuman or extropian,
but I would tend to disagree.  A lot of poetry (this one in particular)
leaves a lot of the assumption up to the individual reader.  In this poem, I
strayed away from close detail of the events which occur.  I find it is not
neccessary in this.
        It might help if you know the Greek myth of 'Narcissus' prior to
reading this poem.



THE OAK AND THE POOL


I was on my way to ecstasy
A sojourn to the unknown
My life had made a mess of me
I needed to atone
Happiness was coming
There was no need to be scared
Though my fear was almost numbing
I went forward with my teeth bared
My eyes opened on solitude
A thing I never had
It totally changed my attitude
The silence made me glad
I was in a forest glen
Near a reflective pool
Far from any men
Away from any rule
I walked slowly to an oak tree
It stood upon the pool's rim
This was a place I wanted to be
I decided to go for a swim
But I saw my own reflection
And I presumed it was bonafide
I gazed hard with affection
For the pool mirrored my inside
I'd never thought much of vanity
Or believed in total peace
But when I saw that image of me
I hoped it would never cease
I stared for hours on end
I couldn't look away
And I soon began to depend
On the pool and it's colours gay
Then suddenly it hit me
As I watched the water reflect
That no matter what I could see
There is no such thing as perfect
There is always more to be found
Always further to go
More to be unbound
Always more to know
So I quickly broke my gaze
>From the enchanting pool
I would not spend all my days
As a catatonic fool
I got away as fast as I could
>From the pool and oak
Escaped the mystical wood
And its perceptual joke
I have a moment of reflection
Every now and then
I ponder on perfection
And think about that glen
It allowed me to perceive
What I never would have guessed:
It is what man does not achieve
That makes him strive to be the best

What about Dyson's work on the infinite survivability of sophontic life 
in an indefinitely expanding, cooling universe? It's been a long time 
since I read this, and I haven't read Tipler's recent book yet either, 
but it doesn't seem to me that making an assumption of the possibility of 
infinite computation settles the question one way or the other.

The Heat Death (I use the term with irony) is approached just as
asymptotically as the Big Crunch, and it would be approached *much* more
slowly, which would give more time for life forms to adapt to the changes
in their physical environment. In the Heat Death scenario, computation
would gradually but inexorably slow down, but it would have a future that
is, for all practical purposes, infinite. It's not as if one day God is
going to flip a big switch that wipes out all the remaining negentroy in
the universe. The point of exactly zero negentroy is infinitely far off in
the future. Computation approaching the Big Crunch, on the other hand,
would have a sharp future time limit, but would speed up "infinitely" as
it approached that limit. 

Either future would require continuous steady adjustment of our "natural 
time scale", but I think we could adapt just as well to either one.

And then there's always the possibility advocated by the Alfvenite
steady-state heretics. At the moment, the Alfvenite/Lernerite stuff
doesn't seem plausible to me, but I think the certainty with which we know
Big Bang theory to be true is greatly exaggerated. Such exaggeration about
the certain truth of theories that are poorly understood by the general
population is usually to the advantage of those who do understand those
theories, especially when seeking funding for further research.

 How? I use the scientific method to evaluate these claims because the
scientific method has worked better than the alternatives. I can't see
anything in my analysis which depends on any assumptions about what
caused the visible universe to exist.

That would seem a most unlikely generalization, even if we didn't have
evidence to the contrary.  As it happens, we *do* have evidence to the
contrary, because on the >H list we saw much support expressed for the
notion that we were there, bouncing ideas off each other, as part of a

wonderful exchange of ideas we were developing our personal worldviews

More likely we all accept the basic ideas of TH but tailor them to suit
our very individual personal makeup.  That certainly expresses my own
approach exactly.

As for it all being *subjective*, you bet it is!!!

Dyson showed that if the universe is open there would always be a time when 
life could exist, but that's not immortality because it would not be possible 
for the universe to perform an infinite number of calculations, and so there 
would  not be an infinite amount of subjective time, even if objectively 
there is an infinite amount of it. If the universe is open there would an
infinite amount of space, but there would be an upper bound on the amount of 
energy and on the amount of momentum in the universe. 
                       
You can't describe a system just by specifying it's configuration space, 
saying where all the particles in it are, you must also specify what the  
momentum of each particle is, this is the Phase Space and is a measure of the 
complexity of a system. According to General Relativity, the size of the
universe's Phase Space is proportional to the velocity it is expanding or 
contracting at, gravity gets stronger when things get closer together and  
it's always attractive, so in the Big Crunch the velocity of the collapse 
will keep getting faster and faster without limit.   
                       
In the Big Crunch, space goes to zero but Phase Space does not, it goes to  
infinity, and thus complexity can increase without limit in a closed universe  
but not in an open one.  Of course, to have any confidence that all this  
really does go to infinity and not just to a very large number we need to 
have a much better understanding of quantum gravity.

YEAH RIGHT! Most people would consider it a major inconvienence which is why
copyrighted works get photocopied without permission all the time even when
it says "do not photocopy without permission" on the text! There must be
some other way which is more convienent.

Tipler claims beings in the Dyson scenario will not be able to build or
integrate more memory fast enough, due to the expansion of the universe. 
I do not claim to understand this completely, but I think we need to take
a look at this problem.

This kind of universe is probably the kindest to unbounded expansion and
development (despite the big antimatter clouds; energy = yum yum!). But it
gets into serious Fermi-paradox trouble.

Even before you said it I WAS THINKING THE SAME EXACT THING! You hit it
right on the money. The "extropian companion to christianity". I should
myself write a book on this if I have time considering I was raised in a
house where my mom taught a bible study/fellowship and is a church secretary
and my whole family is heavily christian.
But you cannot show christians blatantly obvious facts that slap down
religion because they will then take the blind faith defense. I once used
the tactic against my mother in that GOD couldn't have created the entire
population from adam and eve because for about 2 generations after them
there would be major genetic defects from brother-sister and cousin
relationships leading to something nowhere near human due to the gene pool
being so small. But my mother replied that I had to take it on faith that
GOD prevented those birth defects. HOW BLATANTLY STUPID! So I replied, "What
happens if you blind fold yourself and run through a forest? You'd slam into
a tree! now thats blind faith for you!". Or heres another example try
guessing on a math problem, guess what? I bet you'll likely get a wrong
answer. Blind faith is an obvious sign of a memetic infection.

I dunno about you Anders, but my opinion is that Omega Point theories are
depressing from what I was reading on your page about Tipler's idea that our
mental processes can speed up to the point where the last seconds of the
collapse of the universe can seem like an eternity. It just seems kinda
depressing that it all *EVENTUALLY* would end. At least if we have uploading
by 2030 we could already speed up our mental processes while the universe is
expanding (not contracting) and the year after that could be equal to a
million which gives us *PLENTY* of time to figure out FTL (faster than
light) travel. Also how do we know we're not some type of product from a
long-term von newman system made just so that we can evolve to fit the
planet instead of engineering the planet to fit whoever sent out the von
newman probe. I must agree though anders, I keep finding mind-opening ideas
on that website of yours! Keep up the good work! Holy Spirit = Universal

overpopulation won't occur. I'm saying it won't occur because of exponential

This same question has been bugging me.  I like the multi-worlds 
model of the universe, the question this poses is whether there are 
an infinite number of ways to survive through time, or is there one 
optimal survival path which we dare not deviate from ?  
My preferances for universes is a binary one:
Life = good
Death(Entropy) = bad

Would it? Remember, there is no outside time of the universe (where an
observer would see the end of the Big Crunch and then nothin), just time
*inside* the universe. And there are many different ways of experiencing
time, none of which are absolute. To a being in an OP-universe, it could
experience an infinite amount of experiences, without *ever* dying or
seeing the world crumble into quantum ashes.

Yes, of course. Who said the OPT rules out that scenario? In fact, in my
personal view we will first upload, and then become the von Neumann probes
(i.e. posthuman explorers and colonists) spreading across the universe.

The trends seem to be pointing into the opposite direction of your 
outline. While absolute wealth integrated over the population grows, 
it is not equidistributed: a progressive polarization can be observed. 
This seems to be true for most industrialized countries, especially U.S.

They could, but they won't. Trends towards less selfishness is not 
observable. Instead, forting or relocation stragies are utilized.

And I would like to see an extropian position on "social sciences."  There
are mountains of contradictory "quantitative research" on virtually every
political controversy.  Why is this?

In any event, it's hard for me to imagine anything more incompatible with
extropian principles than the Welfare State.

I derive a significant portion of my income from writing, so I've given
this considerable thought.  First, I think the threat of copyright-free
cyberspace is greatly exaggerated.  I don't see books and magazines losing
their advantage over on-screen and computer printout documents any time
soon.  Second, it would require draconian government measures (which many
technocrats and lawyers would welcome) to enforce copyrights in cyberspace.
Chris Hind hit the nail on the head: what people will pay for in
cyberspace is immediacy -- and there are technical means of defending that
advantage.

I'm not sure what to do for poets.  Very few make enough money to worry
about.  Personally, I think poets -- who are supposed to be creative
people, right? -- need to come up with a few new marketing angles.  Perhaps
richly-illustrated texts or a for-profit, Poem-of-the-moment service on the
Net.  Hey, if people call 900 numbers for astrologers and wake-up calls...
Think about it.

But if you get rich with my Poem-of-the-moment idea, remember: you owe me
royalties. <g>

On the contrary, redistribution of wealth began in the early 1900s with the
introduction of income tax, and increased successively with the
establishment of social security, welfare, and medicare.  But I don't
recall equidistribution as one of the extropian principles...

Dyson showed that a computer could go through an infinite number of
compute cycles starting with a finite energy store.  But various such
computers would find it increasingly expensive to communicate with
each other, as the distance between them increased.  Tipler's Omega
Point allows all these computers to communicate more cheaply as time
goes on.

Short answer, I don't know, but you could ask the question in another way.  
If big brains were so hard to make, why did they happen so soon after hands 
developed that were nearly ready to be used by them?

If you take the average of all animals on earth then that's true, but we're 
not interested in all animals, just the ones that led up to humans because 
they're the ones that made it through the filter, we hope. The brains of our 
ancestors got almost 5 times as big in just 3 million years, and it all 
started at the same moment we developed a first rate hand. Perhaps it's jus
t a coincidence, but one thing is certain, that is not an ordinary increase 
in brain size, that is extraordinary.

Am I correct that it would be quite simple to simulate drug experiences on

This idea came to me when that guy in alt.extropians accused me of dropping

Is there any hormones that we know of that control this? or any ideas? Is
there something psychological that can stop us from becoming settled. The
elders of this newsgroup must have something different about them that the
rest of the world settles while they keep marching ahead into new undefined
unexplored territory.

        I think this question will vary from individual to individual.
Personally, I believe  that there is no end to the universe.  In fact, I
*hope* that there is no end to the universe.  If there is no end to the
universe, there is always farther to go.  More to strive for.  If it were
discovered that there was indeed an end, then that would be a limit.  The
stereotypical question: 'where do we go from here' would have a brutal
answer: 'nowhere'.  That would definately be the most depressing day for me,
and probably many others as well.
        As for 'conquering' this universe and moving on to the next, again I
hope not.  The word 'conquering' doesn't sit well with me in the first place.
Why conquer?  Discovery is far more important than actually 'taking
something over'; much like an idea is more important than the final product.
Hence, transhumanism and extropianism.  Insight to the future.  The idea of
'ingredi externus' (a Latin term I often use meaning 'go beyond') is more
important than the product ordained.  Without an idea, there can be no creation.
        Libertarianism is basically the 'politic of freedom'.  Man can only
be free if there is no limit to the lengths he can go, ie: if the universe
has no end, there is no limit that can't be nullified.

          About assuring that an >AI won't harm humans, Robin Hanson 
          said that the police would hunt it down if it misbehaved.
          
          OK, let's assume that an >AI is positively maliscious. It is 
          easy to see what would happen to a moderate >AI in a 
          laboratory if it misbehaved. It would be switched off. It 
          could be more problematic if it were out there in the real 
          world, perhaps with the responsibility for a banking system. 
          Economic losses could be great, but we would hardly risk 
          total destruction unless we gave it unrestricted power over 
          the US nuclear arsenal or such.
          
          But when transhumanists talk about >AI they hardly mean a 
          moderate >AI -like a very brilliant human and then some. We 
          speculate about a machine that would be a million times 
          faster than any human brain, and with correspondingly great 
          memory capacity. Could such a machine, given some time, not 
          manipulate a human society by subtle suggestions that seem 
          very reasonable but unnoticeable affects a general change in 
          attitude and policy? And all the time it would look as if it 
          were a perfectly decent machine, always concerned about our 
          wellfare...
          
          How likely is it that a malicious >AI could bring disaster 
          to a human society that were initially determined to take 
          the necessary precautions?
          
          Society is a quasi-chaotical system: a small perturbation of 
          initial conditions will often lead to large unexpected 
          consequences later on. But there are also regularities and 
          causal relations that can be to some extent predicted. The 
          manipulative power of an >AI would depend on the existence 
          of such sociological regularities that would be obvious to 
          the >AI but would look like irrelevant coincidence to human 
          observers. It is a question of how much sociology and 
          psychology there is to be discovered between what we know 
          now and what an >AI could learn in the course of few years. 
          
          Exactly how much manipulation it would take depends on how 
          close we are to the nearest road to disaster. Perhaps we are 
          close. A deadly virus that would happen to be produced as a 
          by-product of some medical experiment; a little incident 
          that would lead to escalating hatred between China and USA; 
          the list goes on...
          
          My contention is that with only one full-blown >AI in the 
          world, if it were malicious, the odds would be on the side 
          that it could annihilate humanity within decades.

So far as I know, there are only two people from the extropians mailinglist
on IRC. So I am going to start a list so that if we're on IRC we can try to
dcc chat a nick and see if that person is on. So anyways add your
contributions to the list if you are on IRC or know any extropians or
transhumans on irc.

How about "convection".  Now if it were really anti-gravity, I would

How about outright socialism?

It's often been said that the New Deal saved capitalism from itself.
That is a rather debatable statement.  But it is less debatable that the
New Deal may have saved capitalism from what capitalists would consider
to be worse alternatives.  For one thing, it seems to have practically
killed off socialism as a movement with any real power in America.  No,

LIBERTY


Everything I ever wanted was lost
Anything I ever needed always came at some high cost
The protocol of life frowned on me for what I'd feel
And the politics of freedom left no room to be real

I was looking for a paradise -an oasis in my soul
A refuge from emotion, liberty my goal
Peace of mind, peace of heart, a piece of achieved dreams
And while the world backs away in fear, I've found it -or so it seems

The truth lies behind
The liberty of the mind
Insight paves the way
To the freedom of a new day
Man cannot doubt
Unless he has something to believe
Man has no way out
Until he has something to achieve

Basking in my glory, content with my need
Living for myself is surely the best way to succeed
Liberty enacted, freedom oh so near
No more reason for protocol, nothing more to fear

All I ever wanted was to be free
And have my liberty

The truth lies behind
The liberty of the mind
Insight paves the way
To the freedom of a new day
Man can never doubt
Unless he has something to believe
Man has no way out
Until he has something to achieve

        The following was inspired by L. Neil Smith's article on 'Unanimous
Consent and the Utopian Vision'.  It is aptly named "Unanimous Consent".



UNANIMOUS CONSENT


Wouldn't it be great
To wake up one day
And be able to say
"Things will go my way!"

Boy, that would be great!
And it is a possibility
If man could only see
Everyone has the ability

If everyone could see what they wanted to achieve
If everyone did what they always had meant
Though it may seem very hard to believe
We can have unanimous consent

Wouldn't it be great
To want to go far
Drive a really nice car
Be more than you are

Boy, that would be great!
To do what you want to do
Have a Utopia, too
For everyone and you

If everyone could see what they wanted to achieve
If everyone did what they always had meant
Though it may seem very hard to believe
We can have unanimous consent

Won't it be great!
When the future is here
And we'll all forfeit fear
For a forthcoming year!

Boy, that will be great!
We'll soon forget about the crime
And the government pantomime
>From this obsidian time

If everyone could see what they wanted to achieve
If everyone did what they always had meant
Though it may seem very hard to believe
We can have unanimous consent

And it shall be done!
Open mind and clean slate
It will be great
Just you wait!

Then how do you debunk christianity? I'm sure you have gone over this *much*
more acutely and have some REALLY GOOD anti-christianity memes to share that
punch solid holes through christianity.

The single best Christianity-debunking book I know of is W. W. Bartley's
THE RETREAT TO COMMITMENT. Unfortunately, judging by your mother's argument
that you presented, it would be way over her head. But it was written
against the subtlest and best of the twentieth century Christian
theologians and apologists, and I think it does a good job.

But there's ton of simpler stuff on the Web. Have you checked out all the
material at

        http://freethought.tamu.edu/

yet? This is the best general collection I know of, if antichristian
polemics are what you want to focus on.

Nietzsche's THE ANTICHRIST is a lot of fun, too, though again, it might be
a little strong for your mom.

Sure, given one mean super-AI, and rest of the world far behind, we
would be at its mercy.  Simliar fears come from one person in control
of any vastly superior technology, be it nanotech, nukes, homemade
black holes, whatever.  But realistically, any one AI probably won't
be too far ahead of any other AI, so they can police each other.

I don't think the New Deal saved anything.  Socialism in America was killed
off by Stalinists who equated liberalism with fascism until Hitler attacked
the Soviet Union; then they hid their Marxist agenda to better support
their new-found friend, FDR.

Technology is what brought an end to the old boom-bust cycle.  The pace of
economic progress has quickened.  Many more avenues of growth are open.
Networks and PCs have brought more people into the markets, and they can
respond much faster.  Today, every downturn is just a near-term investment
opportunity.

        Nah, it's probably equivalent to the amount of time people have

An >AI can easily agument its own intelligence by adding computing
capacity and
by other means that it will be able to discover or develop, by applying
its
intelligence. This is a rapid feedback mechanism. Thus, as soon as a
moderately
inventive AI comes into existance, it can become even more intelligent.
If the
AI has the goal of destroying humanity, it would be able to do so within
weeks, not decades. Moreover, unless the AI has the active preservation
of humanity as a
goal, it's likely to destroy humanity as a side effect.

This same argument applies to any SI which is capable of rapid
self-augmentation, not
just a straight AI. Since I think that any SI likely to be developed in
the near future
will have a large computer component, it will be capable of rapid
self-augmentation.

My hope is that the SI will develop a "morality" that includes the
active preservation
of humanity, or (better) the uplifting of all humans, as a goal. I'm
still trying to
figure out how we ( the extended transhumanist community) can further
that goal.

I was going to write a long response to your assertion that "ab initio"
computation might serve the SI's purposes better than cooperating with
existing human institutions, but I'm feeling too lazy for that right now.
Instead, I'll just say that if I were serious about figuring out how to
further this goal, what I would do is carefully study Hayek's later works
(what I have in mind in particular are THE CONSTITUTION OF LIBERTY and the
3 vol. LAW, LEGISLATION, AND LIBERTY) and figure out how an SI would refute
them and show that it could actually accomplish its own goals more
effectively through "ab initio" computation than through using widespread
and inaccessible local information about resources it might need to use.
It's possible than an SI could see a flaw in Hayek's arguments that I can't
see, but if this is a danger you're seriously worried about, we might
benefit from finding the flaws in Hayek's arguments before building the SI.

I know the titles of these books make them sound like they are about
history, political philosophy, and law (and they are), but from a slightly
different perspective, they are also books about computation and
epistemology. And they contain almost all the arguments that I personally
would use to persuade an SI to be cooperative rather than indifferent.

Consider that an SI, as such, can only compute. If it wants to *do*
something (and presumably if all it wanted to do was sit and compute, it
would present no threat to human beings), it would need to build a vast
network of sensorics and motorics. But instead of wasting time and
resources on this intermediary means-project, it could work directly toward
its ends by using the five billion sophisticated supercomputers (with their
attached sophisticated sensorics and motorics) that we call human beings.
It could also use the vast and inaccessible (except through the market)
database of local information about resources that might be useful toward
achieving its ends, but this information is lodged in human brains, and
there is no effective way to get *all* of it out in a useful way except
either (1) to use the market and its system of price signals or possibly
(2) uplift all human beings.

Since I'd like to see the SI only uplift *consenting* human beings, it
could use (2) on all the transhumanists, and use (1) (as Hayek would
recommend) on all the other, more conservative, human beings.

The ability of such a superintelligence to do this I don't doubt at all. I
don't know if it's possible, but likewise, I can't assert that it's
impossible. I've seen too much turmoil in the world caused by mere books
written by mehums.  ;)

What I do doubt, however, is that any superintelligence could develop a set
of values and understandings that would lead it to conclude that such a
course of action would be conducive to whatever *other* projects it was
trying to undertake. If the superintelligence actually had, as its primary
value and its primary project, the destruction of human civilization, then
yes, it could succeed. But this project would be directly incompatible with
the swift and efficient implementation of so many other possible projects
that the superintelligence might plausibly value, that I think a "basic"
value for the destruction of human civilization would rapidly get damped
down by competition from other projects the SI might value that would
benefit from using cooperation with human civilization as a means. Just as
a "basic" value of bloodlust in human beings *usually* gets damped down by
competition from the other basic values for sex, money, power-by-consent,
etc. which in the long run and in the context of modern civilization are
ill-served by a taste for nonconsensual violence. The strength of this
damping process for humans will depend on the degree of violence that is
routine in the society in which the human finds emself, but I suspect that
"superintelligence" (whatever that turns out to mean) will strengthen this
process of damping down value-projects that are too incompatible with too
many other competing value-projects.

If the superintelligence is ambitious enough and powerful enough to be a
true value pluralist, to find it boring and trivial to undertake any course
of action other than the simultaneous execution of many different
orthogonal projects in realtime (and I think this does describe the
behavior we observe in many of the brightest human beings so far), then I
don't think we'll have too much to fear from it. Perhaps I'm being an
ostrich about this, but I'd love to hear some solid counterarguments to the
position I'm taking.

That's the possibility that occurred to me after reading your citation of
Nicholas. Certainly Churchland's theory of neurocomputational prototypes
and his related theory of semantics would indicate that most of the
semantic machinery of concepts-in-general (not necessarily our
memetically-evolved modern human concepts) is already in place in the
brains of most higher mammals, and that the special trick that human beings
developed was using these fuzzy cognitive maps (if that's what they turn
out to be like) to generate sequences of sounds that would stimulate and
change the fuzzy cognitive maps in the brains of other human beings. In
other words, language. But the underlying semantic/conceptual machinery of
thought is probably there already in most biggish-brained mammals (and
birds? who knows?). I'm out past the edge of my expertise here, but what
the heck.

If yes, then the hard step (following the usual assumption that there's
only one really hard step in the Great Filter) happened in the development
of some common ancestor of birds and mammals. And now that I think about
how far back that common ancestor is, I'm inclined to think that birds
could not have done the trick, wings, hands, or otherwise. If I thought the
step were that far back, I'd probably prefer my earlier suggestion that the
hard step was the evolution of eukaryotic endosymbiosis... and protist
phylogeny (because it all happened in the past and the fossils are so tiny
and the genes are so full of junk) is about as poorly understood as
mammalian and avian brains are.

I'm starting to feel like the opposite of the drunk who was looking for his
lost wallet under the streetlamp on the corner because "That's where the
light is best." We're looking for the Great Filter in our past, because we
don't like the idea that it might lie in our future, and it seems that I
keep wanting to locate it in the places where the light is poorest, to
account for the fact that I can't find it. Ominous.

Damn this Fermi Paradox anyhow, he said peevishly.

John K Clark may refer to the controversial work of Russel Doolittle, UCSD
(I'm getting this from _Discover_, June 1996, p.37, so add grains of salt to
taste). He proposed a new clock based on the mutation rates of enzymes,
using the same reasoning as RNA mutation rates. He extrapolated three times
beyond the fossil record (so add more salt). Anyway, his timeline was:
        2.0 GY ago -- prokarya
        1.8        -- archaea
        1.2        -- eukarya

Whats so scary about it? I just wish to cure a couple of friends and my

Why does the human brain react this way? Why can people blatently ignore the
facts when they're sitting right in front of their face? Is it a bad
byproduct of self-awareness or our creative side?

I'm not sure about you guys on this issue, but I wish to come out and say
right now that I am a strong supporter of capital punishment. So strong in
fact that I wish they'd make it a mega source of profit by pitting
psychotics against each other in an arena something akin to the movie
RunningMan. I believe that if someone kills another person which violates
that person's rights, the killer's rights should then be violated by being
put to death. Some of you may say now with this in mind that I'm a
libertarian with republican veins because I am also for people carrying
arms. In fact I wouldn't care if people carried around concealed thompson
(sp?) submachine guns. How do you guys feel? Am I ludicrius? (damn, I can't
spell tonite)

Another angle is that sex is an model or ideal for communication, sort of
like music and math are thought to be, so we should be sending sex toys out
on our space probes.  NO!  What I MEANT to say is, maybe we should think
about sex as a model for communication with aliens, or between different
kinds of home-grown intelligences, or even as a model for science in a
universe that one suspects is permeated with intelligence (I'm getting
ready to post on the Great Filter thread).

I haven't read Nietzsche yet (coming up on my list) but from second-hand
reports the quote above seems to epitomize a big problem Nietzsche (and
others too, no question!) has: He can't reconcile peace with exploration,
doubt, questing for the truth, inquiry, self-transcendence, etc.

Nietzsche's solution seems to have been to run away from himself as fast
as he could.  This seems like bee-in-bonnet, too-many-hot-peppers-for-lunch
behavior--I mean a symptom of a problem rather than something pursued for
its own value.  A running-away instead of a going-after.

So I would like to ask the Nietzsche fans in the audience, first, whether
the idea that peace can be compatible with exploration, makes any sense to
you, and second, where I might concentrate my reading of N. to check
his position on this.

First, yes, but it makes a *lot* more sense to me when I consider the idea
from within the Zen Buddhist tradition than it does to me when I consider
the idea from within any Western tradition that I'm likely to affiliate
myself with.

Second, Nietzsche was one of those unreasonable jerks who wrote about
everything that interested him in nearly each one of his books, and did
this for a reason, so it's hard to cite just one book as a place to
concentrate reading to check a position. He really wasn't much of one for
"positions" anyway... with Nietzsche a better metaphor would be
"trajectories". But he talks a lot about the intellectual conscience and
the quest for truth in THE GAY SCIENCE, and to a lesser extent in the first
major section ("On the Prejudices of Philosophers") of BEYOND GOOD AND
EVIL. He talks a lot about peace whenever he talks about "amor fati", which
shows up a lot more often in his later works, from ZARATHUSTRA on. (Hmm, I
wonder why.) But Nietzsche had dreadful health and was in pain more often
than not, so comfort just wasn't big on his list of priorities since it was
basically unobtainable for him.

The guy was a weirdo, what can I say.

Aw come on, I am talking about the period from 1980's to end 1990's. In 
this period, I've seen the Scandinavian model going down the drain. Quite 
recently, Krautland has started reducing welfare state quite noticeably. 
Afaik, U.S. has not started such a (redistribution) programme, au 
contraire. The numbers & growth trend of the unhomed are not exactly
exalting, imo.

Well, I am not an extropian. I've been labeled as such by others, though.
I said about an equidistribution _trend_, I never proposed actual
equidistribution for target. That would be communism, and I've seen what 
even socialism can do, having lived in the heart of Commieland for 14 
years.

Providing basic bread (+butter) & games (brown ware) for the masses 
would keep them from raising an insurrection "against those rich above". 
I don't know how you see it, but I doubt a civil war can be fun.

Guns were outlawed there. Nevertheless look at all the NRA activities, 
neighbourhood watches & whatever. At the very least we don't get shot by 
mistake in Krautland at license controls if you take your hands off the 
steering wheel & most European cities are arguably safe, imo. I am not sure 
that guns are a Good Thing, anymore (yeah, I've read Vinge & liked him).

Yes, it would be trivial. Just modify the emulation (which involves a lot
of emulation of neurotransmittor and receptor activity) slightly. You
could even create drugs with no aftereffects or completely new virtual
drugs, working in completely new manners (like a dominance-enhancing drug
that works only on your amygdala, or drugs to produce pleasant visual
hallucinations based on internet traffic).

But the big question is if this prevents memory growth. Suppose I use a 
fraction of my energy to produce positronium or something similar to 
store my information in as I grow. Would the energy needed to communicate 
with my remote memory banks become prohibitive? As I understand it, a 
sufficiently slowly growing being would never have any problems with 
redshifts *inside* itself.

And a sufficiently large being can contain other beings. While the 
universe cools and slows down, we are partying inside a splendid 
posthuman virtual universe with an unbounded future.

I noticed that subject discipline on the list has gotten kind
of lax, with lots of political frustrations coming out.  My bit
in response to the "productive people each supporting
millions of destitute loafers in the future":  Why would we
want to do that?  Point being, they'd just keep breeding
without foresight until they surpassed all the carrying
capacity of the planet, and even with hightech, until in one
last malthusian collapse they tried to consume the
remaining products of civilization, leaving a burned out
world without resources and with a slaughtered intellectual
elite.  Let's face it, the only solution is to make conception
a cognitive and pricey activity, thereby guaranteeing at
least a semblance of planning, foresight and economic
wear-with-all.  Let contagious nanotech provide universal
barriers to all accidental conception.  The population
would drop to very comfortable and elite levels within two
generations.

As for uploading and becoming von neuman machines. 
Honestly, am I the only extropian who likes the flesh?
Maybe I should form a faction of tech fiends who are
sleazy enough to appreciate the aesthetics and primal joy
of a fit sweaty body.  Maybe I'm just an immortalist who
thinks the whole universe should be our domain.  I guess I
wouldn't mind being able to have alternate _identities_  of
man, machine, cyborg, virtual entity--but I certainly don't
want to be constrained to one.  Nor give up the best of
humanity.  A product of the mind is art.  And beauty is
art.  For those who think I'm shallow.  Take a look at
Michelangelo's David.  I guess I'm as attached to physical
beauty as I am to intellectual brilliance and scientific truth. 
Anyone else out there feel remotely the same?  Feel free
to email me directly with suggestions or criticisms.  I have
a thick skin, and don't want the list to get clogged with
non-technical issues.

Yes, I think this is the best solution. My personal view is that a being 
should only reproduce if it can guarantee its progeny a certain minimum 
amount of resources. If every being uses this strategy, collapses can be 
avoided and there is a strong incentive for expanding the ecological niche.

Problem: how do we get there?

Well, this scheme requires some work. I think there are plenty of people 
who wouldn't like the idea of an outside force interfering in their 
reproductive capacity (can you hear all the libertarians screaming 
"Coercion!!!"?). And how do you remove the barrier to make conception 
possible, even for people in remote areas with little education? (The 
nanite writes instructions in ten languages on the skin? :-)

More practically, we cannot wait for nanotech, the problem is nasty enough
in some areas (not overpopulation per se, but a combination of poverty,
badly working infrastructure and the risk for famine). What can we do
today? I think spreading the meme is the best way to get out to many
people in lieu of any practical super-technology fix. This seems to fit in
well with the general extropian goal of spreading a kind of enlightenment.

I agree with you, although I will probably base my existence on being a
highly portable information-structure with no fixed physical location or
body. I have a certain distaste for *having* to live in the flesh; I want
to live in a comfortable and useful body, without having to deal with the 
vagaries of evolution.

But I really understand that many are not as interested in abandoning 
their biological bodies; they have their charm too.

 If the SI is a recent upload, that will almost certainly be true,
but what if, as Drexler suggests, the SI's evolve because someone
throughs enough computing power at it to repeat the processes by which
intelligence evolved on earth. Then the SI's will be part of a society
and an ecosystem that evolved with them, and the additional society
that they could find in the external world wouldn't necessarily be any
more valuable to them than Africa or China are to most of us.

      I agree ,one could imagine - very dramatic!  But - I am still wondering
what would cause an Artificial life or Intelligence to be malicious?
  Ok first of all, if the intelligence was formed by error correcting neural

Would  they exist in a purely cause and effect reality - assuming they are
still machines (here not referring to >H SI's but true man made {or self

A-life application?
       We still think in terms of survival as being a "threatenable" state -
part of the mortality meme, I guess. Would an AI completely capable of
backing itself up endlessly really see ( what we think of as) death as a
threat? Malicious also implies that it would  inherenly dislike us. Why would
it?  
     [ Perhaps wrongly - I am assuming that a machine which replicates

    Do we assume they would ,by default, since humanity built them, take on

         Of course then we may actively seek to develope predatory weaponry
types of AI , I guess. That is dangerous.

          The issues are complex. To begin with, the claim that it is 
          improbable that one AI would be far ahead of any other AI 
          can be challenged. Suppose there are possible breakthroughs 
          to be made in computer technology. Once an AI became 
          sufficiently intelligent, it could think out a radical 
          improvement to its design; which would make it more 
          intelligent, allowing it to accelerate further; and so on. 
          (I think this is Dan Clemmensen's view.) For example, the AI 
          might be the first to make efficient use of nanotechnology. 
          If nanotech has such potentials as Drexler thinks, access to 
          a nanotech laboratory would be all the AI would need in 
          order to take off. The contest would be over before anyone 
          except the AI had realised it had begun.
          
          In the slower scenario I depicted in the last letter, 
          however, it is unlikely that the AI would be alone. Its 
          discoveries would be diffused and employed to build other 
          AIs.
          
          But even in this case it is dubious that these other AIs 
          would be an effective protection against possible malicious 
          intentions of the first AI. They would, in effect, be its 
          offspring, and could therefore be expected to inherit some 
          of its basic properties, even values. If the first >AI is 
          bad, it might influence the development of computers so that 
          among subsequent machines a specific value set would be 
          prevalent which would allow them to form a tacit consensus 
          concerning the desirability of finally getting rid of the 
          human pest. 
          
          It is also worth considering what would make the grandpa >AI 
          bad in the first place:
          
          1) Accident, misprogramming.
          
          2) Constructed by a bad group of humans, for military or 
          commercial purposes. This group is presumably very powerful 
          if they are the first to build an >AI. The success of this 
          enterprise will make them even more powerful. Thus the 
          values present in the group (community, company, state, 
          culture) that makes the first >AI will not unlikely be the 
          value set which is programmed into subsequent >AIs as well.
          
          3) Moral convergence. Sufficiently intelligent beings might 
          tend to converge in what they value, possibly because values 
          are in some relevant sense "objective". They just see the 
          truth that to annihilate humans is for the best. (In this 
          case we should perhaps let it happen?)
          
          Notice that in case (2) and (3) policing would not work even 
          in the slow scenario and even if the first >AI itself had 
          little influence on the construction of other >AIs.

Landauer, Bennett and Merkle have shown that with reversible computing the  
amount of energy needed to make a calculation can be made arbitrarily small  
by slowing down the calculation a little. Even a small reduction in speed can  
help a lot in energy saving, the power dissipation (per unit of time) falls 
as the SQUARE of the speed, and at the Omega point things will naturally speed  
up because at the Big Crunch the parts of your computer will keep getting  
closer together so it takes less time to send a message from one part to  
another. More recently in the June 28 1996 issue of Science, Landauer shows  
(in a interesting but non practical way) how you can also communicate and not  
just compute information with an arbitrarily small amount of energy if you  
are willing to slow things down. 

We'll never run out of energy to perform a calculation if the universe 
reverses it's expansion in a non symmetrical way and we have a big crunch.  
We will have not a huge amount of usable lots of energy, we will have an 
infinite amount. Tipler's idea is to trade energy for subjective time, 
we have infinite energy  so we have infinite time.

In an open universe you only have a finite amount of energy to work with, 
so you'll want to slow things way down, but other problems that Landauer did 
not  consider will force you to slow things even more, and use more energy 
too.  The components of your brain keep getting more distant so that's going 
to keep slowing things way down. Also, in order to establish reliable 
communication it's going to take more and more photons of light to send one  
bit of information. It won't be easy for one part of a brain to hit it's  
target a billion trillion light years away, not much chance if you only send  
one photon. Also, each photon will be strongly and increasingly redshifted, 
to compensate the sender must keep shorting the wavelength of the photons he  
uses, this takes more energy and you only have a finite amount of it. 
                      

                >Anders Sandberg                 
                >As I understand it, a sufficiently slowly growing being             
                >would never have any problems with redshifts *inside* itself.
                

I don't see why that would be so.

This issue came up when I was debating Paulina Boorsook on the BrainTennis
forum of HotWired. She was under the impression that all Extropians dislike,
hate, fear, or feel uncomfortable in their physical bodies, and that we're
all hell bent on dumping them. This may be true for some, but I know enough
Extropians to know it's not generally true.

I agree with you, Tim, in that I want a *choice* of bodies, physical and
virtual. I take great pleasure in my current physical body and spend
considerable time and energy to keep it in condition. Like any Extropian, I
want to add to my body's abilities and to be able to modify its responses
according to my will rather than leaving its responses and capacities
primarily an accident of my genes. Eventually, assuming I make it to that
time, I expect to see this body--or whatever it has become--as only one
among a choice of physical vehicles.

Tim, your comment suggests you think you might be the only one who
appreciates the way of flesh among Extropians. That's certainly not true. I
know many of us who love working out, having sex, hiking, surfing, skiing,
swimming, etc. I think it's a big mistake to give the impression to the
public that Extropians reject the physical body. Maybe a few seek to live as
utterly disembodied thinkers, but most of us want to enjoy all the means of
being in contact with reality, including physical sensations and perceptions.

Abstract -- Our concepts of biology, evolution and complexity
 are constrained by having observed only a single instance of
 life, life on earth. A truly comparative biology is needed to
 extend these concepts. Because we cannot observe life on other
 planets, we are left with the alternative of creating Artificial
 Life forms on earth. I will discuss the approach of inoculating
 evolution by natural selection into the medium of the digital
 computer. This is not a physical/chemical medium; it is a
 logical/informational medium. Thus, these new instances of
 evolution are not subject to the same physical laws as organic
 evolution (e.g. the laws of thermodynamics) and exist in what
 amounts to another universe, governed by the "physical laws" of
 the logic of the computer. This excercise gives us a broader
 perspective on what evolution is and what it does.

 An evolutionary approach to synthetic biology consists of
 inoculating the process of evolution by natural selection into
 an artificial medium. Evolution is then allowed to find the
 natural forms of living organisms in the artificial medium.
 These are not models of life, but independant instances of life.
 This essay is intended to communicate a way of thinking about
 synthetic biology that leads to a particular approach: to
 understand and respect the natural form of the artificial
 medium, to facilitate the process of evolution in generating
 forms that are adapted to the medium, and to let evolution find
 forms and processes that naturally exploit the possibilities
 inherent to the medium. Examples are cited of synthetic biology
 embedded in the computational medium, where in addition to being
 an exercise in experimental comparative evolutionary biology, it
 is also a possible means of harnessing the evolutionary process
 for the production of complex computer software.

1 Synthetic Biology

Articial Life (AL) is the enterprise of understanding biology by
constructing biological phenomena out of artificial components,
rather than breaking natural life forms down into their
component parts. It is the synthetic rather than the
reductionist approach. I will describe an approach to the
synthesis of artificial living forms that exhibit natural
evolution.

The umbrella of AI is broad and covers three principal
approaches to synthesis: in hardware (e.g. robotics,
nanotechnology), in software (e.g., replicating and evolving
computer programs), and in wetware (e.g., replicating and
evolving organic molecules, nucleic acids, or others). This
essay will focus on software synthesis, although it is hoped
that the issues discussed will be generalizable to any synthesis
involving the process of evoluton.

I would like to suggest that software syntheses in AL could be
divided into two kinds: simulations and instantiations of life
processes. AL simulations represent an advance in biological
modeling, based on a bottom-up approach, which has been made
possible by the increase of available computational power. In
the older approaches to modeling of ecological or evolutionary
phenomena, systems of differential equations were set up that
expressed relationships between covarying quantities of entities
(i.e., genes, alleles, individuals, or species) in the
populations or communities.

The new bottom-up approach creates a population of data
structures, with each instance of the data structure
corresponding to a single entity. These structures contain
variables defining the state of an individual. Rules are defined
as to how the individuals interact with one another and with the
environment. As the simulation runs, populations of these data
structures interact according to local rules, and the global
behaviour of the system emerges from these interactions. Several
very good examples of bottom-up ecological models have appeared
in the AL literature [33,91]. However, ecologists have also
developed this same approach independently of the AL movement
and have called the approach "individual-based" models [19,39].

The second approach to software synthesis is what I have called
instantiation rather than simulation. In simulation, data
structures are created that contain variables that represent the
states of the entities being modeled. The important point is
that in simulation, the data in the computer is treated as a
representation of something else, such as a population of
mosquitoes or trees. In instantiation, the data in the computer
does not represent anything else. The data patterns in an
instantiation are considered to be living forms in their own
right and are not models of any natural life form. These can
form the basis of a comparative biology [57].

The object of an AL instantiation is to introduce the natural
form and process of life into an artificial medium. This results
in an AL form in some medium other than carbon chemistry and is
not a model of organic life forms. The approach discussed in
this essay involves introducing the process of evolution by
natural selection into the computatonal medium. I consider
evolution to be the fundamental process of life and the
generator of living form.

2 Recognizing Life

Most approaches to defining life involve assembling a short set
of properties of life and then testing candidates on the basis
of whether or not they exhibit the properties on the list. The
main problem with this approach is that there is disagreement as
to what should be on the list. My private list contains only two
items: self-replication and open-ended evolution. However, this
reflects my biases as an evolutionary biologist.

I prefer to avoid the semantic argument and take a different
approach to the problem of recognizing life. I was led to this
view by contemplating how I would regard a machine that
exhibited conscious intelligence at such a level that it could
participate as an equal in a debate like this. The machine would
meet neither of my two main criteria as to what life is, yet I
don't feel that I could deny that the process it contained was
alive.

This means that there are certain properties that I consider to
be unique to life and whose presence in a system signify the
existance of life in that system. This suggests an alternative
approach to the problem. Rather than create a short list of
minimal requirements and test whether a system exhibits all
items on the list, one could create a long list of properties
unique to life and test whether a system exhibits _any_ item on
the list.

To this softer, more pluralistic approach to recognizing life,
the objective is not to determine if the system is alive or not
but to determine if the system exhibits a "genuine" instance of
some property that is a signature of living systems (e.g.,
self-replication, evolution, flocking, consciousness).

Whether we consider a system living because it exhibits some
property that is unique to life amounts to a semantic issue.
What is more important is that we recognize that it is possible
to create disembodied but genuine instances of specific
properties of life in artificial systems. This capability is a
powerful research tool. By separating the property of life that
we choose to study from the many other complexities of natural
living systems, we make it easier to manipulate and observe the
property of interest. The objective of the approach advocated in
this paper is to capture genuine evolution in an artificial
system.

3 What Natural Evolution Does

Evolution by natural selection is a process that enters into a
physical medium. Through iterated replication with selection of
large populations through many generations, it searches out the
possibilities inherent in the "physics and chemistry" of the
medium in which it is embedded. It exploits any inherent
self-organizing properties of the medium in which it is
embedded. It exploits any inherent self-organization of the
medium and flows into natural attractors realizing and fleshing
out their structure.

Evolution never escapes from its ultimative imperative:
self-replication.  However, the mechanisms that evolution
discovers for achieving this ultimative goal gradually become so
convoluted and complex that the underlying drive can seem to
become superfluous. Some philosophers have argued that the
evolutionary theory as expressed by the phrase "survival of the
fittest" is tautological, in that the fittest are defined as
those that survive to reproduce. In fact, fitness is achieved
through innovation in engineering of the organism [81]. However,
there remains something peculiarly self-referential about the
whole enterprise. There is some sense in which life may be a
natural tautology.

Evolution is both a defining characteristic and the creative
process of life itself. The living condition is a state that
complex physical systems naturally flow into under certain
conditions. It is a self-organizing, self-perpetuating state of
autocatalytically increasing complexity. The living component of
the physical system quickly becomes the most complex part of the
system, such that it reshapes the medium in its own image. Life
then evolves adaptations predominantly in relation to the living
components of the system, rather than the nonliving components.
Life evolves adaptations to itself.

3.1 Evolution in Sequence Space

Think of organisms as occupying a "genotype space" consisting of
all possible lengths of the elements of genetic system (i.e.,
nucleotids or machine instructions). When the first organism
begins replicating, a single self-replicating creature, with a
single sequence of certain length, occupies a single point in
the genotype space. However, as the creature replicates in the
environment, a population of creatures forms, and errors cause
genetic variation, such that the population will form a cloud of
points in the genotypes centered around the original point.

Because the new prototypes that form the cloud are formed by
random processes, most of them are completely inviable and die
without reproducing. However, some of them are capable of
reproduction. These new genotypes persist, and, because some of
them are affected by mutation, the cloud of points spreads
further. However, not all of the viable genomes are equally
viable. Some of them discover tricks to replicate more
efficiently. These genotypes increase in frequency, causing the
population of the creatures at the corresponding points of the
genotype space to increase.

Points in the genotype space occupied by greater populations of
individuals will spawn larger number of mutant offspring; thus
the density of the cloud of points in the genotype space will
shift gradually in the direction of the more fit genotypes. Over
time, the cloud of points will percolate through the genotype
space, either expanding outward as a result of random drift or
by flowing along fitness gradients.

Most of the volume of this space represents completely inviable
sequences. These regions of the space may be momentarily and
sparsely occupied by inviable mutants, but the cloud will never
flow into the inviable regions. The cloud of genotypes may
bifurcate as it flows into habitable regions in different
directions, and it may split as large genetic changes spawn
genotypes in distant but viable regions of the space. We may
imagine that the evolving population of creatures will take the
form of wispy clouds flowing through this space.

Now imagine for a moment the situation that there was no
selection. This implies that every sequence is replicated at an
equal rate. Mutation will cause the cloud of points to expand
outward, eventually filling the space uniformly. In this
situation, the complexity of the structure of the cloud of
points does not increase through time, only the volume that it
occupies. Under selection by contrast, through time the cloud
will take on an intrinsicate structure as it flows along fitness
gradients and percolates by drift through narrow regions of
viability in a largely uninhabitable space.

Consider that the viable region of the genotype space is a very
small subset of the total volume of the space, but that it
probably exhibits a very complex shape, forming tendrils and
sheets sparsely permeating an otherwise empty space. The complex
structure of this cloud can be considered to be a product of
evolution by natural selection. This thought experiment appears
to imply that the intricate structure that the cloud of
genotypes may assume through evolution is fully deterministic.
Its shape is predefined by the physics and chemistry and the
structure of the environment, in much the same way that the form
of the Mandelbrot set is predetermined by its defining equation.
The complex structure of this viable space is inherent in the
medium and is an example of "order for free" [44].

No living world will ever fill the entire viable subspace,
either at a single moment of time, or even cumulatively over its
entire history. The region actually filled will be strongly
influenced by the original self-replicating sequence and by
stochastic forces that will by chance push the cloud down a
subset of possible habitable pathways. Furthermore, coevolution
and ecological interactions imply that certain regions can only
be occupied when certain other regions are also occupied. This
concept of the flow of genotypes through the genotype space is
essentially the same as that discussed by Eigen [22] in the
context of "quasispecies". Eigen limited his discussion to
species of viruses, where it is also easy to think of sequence
spaces. Here, I am extending the concept beyond the bounds of
the species to include entire phylogenies of species.

3.2 Natural Evolution in an Artifical Medium

Until recently, life has been known as a state of matter,
particularly combinations of the elements carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen, nitrogen, and smaller quantities of many others.
However, recent work in the field of AL has shown that the
natural evolutionary process can proceed with great efficacy in
other media, such as the informational medium of the digital
computer [1,3,5,15,16,20,24,42,43,50,52,53,67,68,70-73,76,77,
80,88,90,96]. \footnote{In ref. I, Adami has used the
input-output facilities of the new Tierra languages to feed data
to creatures, and select for responses that result from single
computations, not contained in the seed genome. In ref. 7,
Brooks has created his own Tierra-like system, which he calls
Sierra. In his implementation, each machine instruction consists
of an opcode and an operand. Succesive instructions overlap such
that the operand of one instruction is interpreted as the opcode
of the next instruction. In ref. 88, "Tierra-like systems are
being explored for their potential applications in solving the
problem of predicting the dynamics of consumption of a single
energy carrying resource."}

These new natural evolutions in artificial media are beginning
to explore the possibilities inherent in the "physics and
chemistry" of those media. They are organizing themselves and
constructing self-generating complex systems. While these new
living systems are still so young that they remain in their
primordial state, it appears that they have embarked on the same
kind of journey taken by life on earth and presumably have the
potential to evolve into levels of complexity that could lead to
sentient and eventually intelligent beings.

If natural evolution in artifical media leads to sentient or
intelligent beings, they will likely be so alien that they will
be difficult to recognize. The sentient properties of plants are
so radically different from those of animals hat they are
generally unrecognized or denied by humans, and plants are
merely in another kingdom of the one great tree of organic life
on earth [69,74,87]. Synthetic organisms evolving in other
media, such as the digital computer, are not only not a part of
the same philogeny, but they are not even of the same physics.
Organic life is based on conventional materal physics, whereas
digital life exists in a logical, not material, informational
universe. Digital intelligence will likely be vastly different
from human intelligence, forget the Turing test.

[As far as I can tell, this posting of last night never appeared on the
list. So here it is again. MM]

This evening, Extropy Institute was offered an opportunity to have its Web
site filmed for a show with an expected audience of 5-10 million. The
filming is to take place next Monday.

This is a superb opportunity to introduce Extropian ideas to thousands of
web surfers. The challenge here is that Eric and I have been so absorbed
with other projects that we haven't developed the ExI web site yet. Still,
I'm confident that by Monday a mini-Manhattan project can get one minute of
filmable material online. The text is easy. We have some graphics, which is
important for the filming to produce attractive results. But we really could
do with some more suitable graphics.

THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN HELP!

We'd really like to show some simple but striking images to get viewers
interested enough (combined with the 2.5 minutes of explaining the ideas) to
check out the site. (The show won't air for several weeks, giving us a
chance to build it up by the time people look at it in detail on the Web.)
Graphics I'd especially like to have for the site:

     * A 3-D version of the extropy 5-arrow spiral emblem.

     * An animated gif of the spiral logo (whether 3D or not).

Obviously we can use for graphics things like covers of Extropy, images from
Natasha Vita More's site, illustrations from Extropy articles, and we can
show links to other sites covering aspects of extropian ideas and technologies.

If you have other ideas for graphics appropriate to the site, and the means
to implement them, please contact me asap. The latest we could add graphical
contributions to the site would be this Sunday. Earlier than that would make
it easier to integrate them with whatever else we put together. Of course,
you will be credited for graphical contributions.

If you have graphics on your personal web site of any kind that might
appropriate, we would be delighted to have use of them. This will benefit
your site too, since if you have appropriate material, the ExI site will
have links to your site by the time the TV viewers see the show.

Time is tight. The opportunity to spread Extropian ideas wider is here.
Please help if you can.

Thank you,

Max

highly unlikely to appear on the scene first.

Even now, there is lots of sensorics & motorics attached to the Internet. 
Lots of methods to break into systems are currently known. Though 
web security is likely to improve drastically, if one chooses to interpret
some RFCs thusly, nevertheless an SI is the ultimative cracker incarnate.

By which I mean having within one's sphere of influence enough wealth to

to trade for water.  Which means everyone must trade to survive, which
means that the first libertarian liberty of being able not to interact

coercion much more seriously.  Having one's own self-sufficient wealth
would solve that problem; I think it would also help solve the
reproduction problem.  A rational being (and most people can be locally
rational) wouldn't have more children than their sphere could support.

If there wasn't a frontier (uh oh, extropians like frontiers) and
children didn't have a high probability of dying and it was clear how
many people at what level your domain could support, people should breed
less.  If they didn't, people otherwise inclined to feel guilty could
point to the time when everything was set up right and say to the excess

developement of these traits in animal intelligences ( including alpha

conquering or the like.  And mortality - a fear of... mean, "bad" emotions
that these instincts evoke.

Since AIs wouldnt be subject to these conditions, why would it develope these

Chris Hind asks:

"Why can people blatently ignore the
facts when they're sitting right in front of their face?"

and,

"Then how do you debunk christianity?"

First of all, people will see what they want to see and hear what they want to 
hear.  There's so much information coming through our senses and being 
generated internally by the brain, that it is literally impossible to pay 
attention to more than a small fraction of it.  So we're very selective about 
what we consider important information to process.  What we pay attention to 
is very related to our current goals; we pay attention to what we think will 
help us accomplish our goals, and we tend to ignore everything else.  For 
example, when driving a car, we tend to pay attention mostly to things which 
relate to our driving; other cars, the street signs, stop lights, pedestrians 
crossing the street, things like that.  Other details of our experience are 
generally down-played or ignored.  Not everyone has the goal of understanding 
their world and maximizing their intelligence and creativity; most have goals 
of having other people express approval of them and of getting done with the 
drudgery which they find themselves engaged in.  
	So, if someone doesn't have a compelling interest in making rational sense of 
their world, it is very easy for them to ignore the facts that are sitting 
right in front of their face.  Just like it is easy for me to ignore fashion 
polls and god-knows-what-else is in those glamour magazines.  It's simply 
outside of the area of my interest.  I don't value that information, so I 
ignore it.
	Most Christians don't value truth or rational arguments, so they will simply 
ignore these things, much to the chagrin of those, like us, who do.  
Presenting a Christian with a rational argument, especially one which 
contradicts their beliefs, is almost always futile.  First, they have to value 
rationality and intelligence, otherwise, everything you say is just 
meaningless garbage to them.
	Probably the best way to communicate with Christians is to speak in their 
language, and that means speaking as though you accepted their basic 
metaphysical assumptions.  As ludicrous as you may find their assumptions, you 
will not be able to communicate with them unless it appears to them that you 
have accepted their basic assumptions.  Use their own myths and metaphors, but 
use the ones that most closely resemble your own values.
	They literally speak a different language than you do, and to communicate 
with them, you must translate your ideas into their language.  Yes, much is 
lost in the translation, but you just have to make the best of it.  Ideally, 
you want to get them speaking your language, the language of the rationalists, 
but it's not so easy to teach them, especially when they have no motivation to 
learn it, and if they see it as hostile to their own cherished beliefs.
	Some members of my family are into the particular variety of Christianity 
called Mormonism.  It's often very difficult to communicate my ideas to them, 
but since I was raised in that belief system, I understand it very well, and I 
can do a pretty good job of translating my ideas into their belief systems.  I 
just make a mapping of concepts.  For example, I think about the God concept 
and what it means to them, then I find something reasonably similar in my own 
mind, that has the same type of meaning to me, that fulfulls a similar purpose 
in my own mind, and I do this with all their other concepts, making a very 
coherent mapping of my thinking onto their own.  This way, I can speak and 
sound like a Mormon, but the deeper structure of what I say will reflect my 
own ways of thinking.  It's the deeper structure that conveys my real meaning, 
not the literal interpretation of the symbols I'm using, but the way that I 
link the symbols together.
	Each belief system is literally a different language, a different way of 
linking up concepts.  To really influence someone's thinking, you must have a 
deep understanding of their conceptual map and speak to them as though you 
think very similarly to them, by speaking in their own language.  Then you 
will better understand what changes to make to their conceptual map to lead 
them in the direction you want them to go.
	So, how do you debunk Christianity?  You don't.  You can't.  At least not to 
the believers; they have no interest in processing your arguments, and your 
arguments are literally in a different language than they know; they don't 
even know how to make sense of what you are saying; to them, it's nonsense.  
But you can speak their language to them and help them re-prioritize their 
values, so that they value increasing their intelligence *more* than they do 
now, and you can help them to enjoy THINKING more than they do now.  You can 
discuss their belief system very intently with them, but don't criticize it, 
or they'll just shut down.  Discuss it as though you believe it and examine it 
very closely with them.  Talk about various points of doctrine with them.  
Just get them thinking.  Once they develop good thinking skills they will do 
their own debunking.
	But you must work with them, not against them.  Work from the inside, as a 
friend, not from the outside as an attacker.  Teach them critical thinking 
skills, by example.  Learn to state your reasoning out loud, in terms they can 
understand and agree with.  Don't just state your conclusions, but lead them 
through the process of reasoning, so that you can provide their mind with a 
template that they can use.  The reasoning skills are far more important than 
whether you think the metaphors you are using are really bullshit when 
understood literally.  It's the function that's important, not the variables.  
Once they know how to reason well, they will start questioning their own 
assumptions, and you can help them through the debunking process, but not 
until they're ready, not until they start doing it on their own.
	Unfortanately, it doesn't seem like you've fully recovered from Christianity 
yourself.  You want the Christians to just accept the facts that are sitting 
right in front of their face, and then they will be saved! :-)  This is a very 
Christian attitude, the stressing of instantaneous salvation, that if you 
accept certain beliefs then you are saved, if not you are damned.  Christians 
tend to overlook personal development and focus instead on whether you're in 
the club or out of the club. 	What really matters is personal development, not 
whether you accept certain facts or not.  I think the most important thing is 
that people work on increasing their own intelligence, creativity and 
happiness; their own Extropy, regardless of their religious preference.  If 
their religion is stifling them, then they will move beyond it, if their true 
commitment is to increasing Extropy.  
	The memes we must spread are the ones which influence people to become 
committed to increasing Extropy.  And I think that the best strategy (somewhat 
contrary to what I wrote previously about offending people's minds, but then I 
don't try to be consistent; I'm still learning, after all), is to quietly 
infiltrate various belief systems and insert some well-designed memes that 
will promote increasing Extropy.  We must attach these memes to the religion 
itself somehow, so that it becomes a very important part of the religion, or 
at least of the belief systems of the members of the religion.  Most religions 
I know of already have a lot of Extropian components, so it will mainly be a 
matter of stressing those aspects more and slightly rearranging things so that 
the Extropian Values are seen as very important by the members of the 
religion.  We should bring as little foreign material into the religion as we 
can, but instead work with the religion itself to transform it into something 
more Extropian than it already is.

It looks like Sean Morgan beat me in pointing out that the Great Filter 
debate about the evolution of life on Earth is missing an important piece of 
the puzzle:

I might also suggest the following:
http://www.sciencenews.org/sn_arch/8_24_96/fob1.htm

The Science news article notes:

"In 1977, Carl R. Woese of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 
shook this tree of life when he declared that several known microorganisms 
deserve a branch of their own [Archaea - the autotrophs]."

"Autotrophs, unlike animals, do not depend upon amino acids and organic 
molecules from their environment. M. jannaschii 'makes everything it needs 
from carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and hydrogen,' says Venter [J. Craig Venter 
of The Institute for Genomic Research ] ...  [Recently] investigators have 
discovered abundant archaea all around them. 'It shows how little we know 
about life on this planet. This group of organisms could represent more than 
50 percent of the earth's biomass,' says Venter"

"Understanding how and when autotrophs evolved may topple the popular idea 
that life originated in a primordial pool rich in amino acids and organic 
molecules. 'That theory has been challenged, especially in recent years, by 
scientists, including myself, who believe life began in an autotrophic way,' 
says Woese. "

Then why do they claim they "seek the truth"?

At least there is one good force pushing atheism. Public school peer

I believe this is already being done. I saw a book awhile back in a magazine
called "GOD wants our us to thrive" or something of the sort which
supposedly dealt with the idea that the christian GOD wants planet earth to
grow, develop, get better and better and make people happy. If only I could
find that book!

This won't occur at all! Simply because millions are being infected in india
and asia currently with HIV and so far there's no cure in sight. (unless you
count nanotech or viruses engineered to go out and kill HIV which won't be
for awhile) So this in itself will suck away a large portion of the low
intellect populous (it sounds cruel but true do to poor families stifling
their children's brain growth from malnutrition). This should open up vast
quantities of FREE LAND! Where we extropians can go out and claim it and
create a new country! :) (sick sense of humor).

Why would you be constrained? You could simply upload your brain to a
computer inside a box in a human biological drone's brain where you could
control the body from the box in it's head with the box being an interface
between the body and the digital consciousness. Therefore you'd experience
all human toils if you wished, but you can also simply emulate them in
virtual space so why go to all the trouble?

So what? Everything in virtual space will appear to you as 'real'. Maybe you
can't grasp the concept of what it would be like to be uploaded? Everyting
in virtual space would appear real and tactile to you. You could use every
sense in the virtual space or even amplify them. You could design new
emotions even. You could appear in the virtual space any way you wished to
look. You could even keep your original body post uploading and dispose of
the biological brain and put a box in it's skull cavity so that you could
control your original body when you wished. It would be as though you were
in your original body and hadn't been uploaded yet but you could have access
to the sum of human knowledge via wireless lan connections from the box in
your body's head to the internet. I want a T1 wired to my brain! :) You
could even have multiple bodies with different features and characteristics
and looks and jump in and out of them.

No I have an penet email address also but I was just wondering how paranoid

You'd have to be very vain to think that you'd be that important for someone

In the same way that I believe humanity has only short-term utility to
the SI as a
knowledge resource, I also believe that humanity has only short-term
utility
as a sensory-motor resource. building a vast sensor-motor resource is
straightforward,
given nanotechnology or even a more conventionally-constructed set of
general
-prupose robots. To use humans for this purpose entails the same kind of
interactions
humans use with each other, such as contracts, mangagment, etc. A
self-augmenting
SI should achieve higher efficiency than this in a matter of a few
weeks.
  If I were part of the decision-making part of the first SI, I'd start
by
augmenting the computer part of myself to increase my intelligence. I'd
then use
my increased intelligence to 1) take control of the finincial system (or
at least
of a serious amount of money) and 2) solve the remaining engineering
problems
associated with practical nanotech. I'd then send purchase orders to
machine tool
manufacturers, hire humans, and build the initial nanotech assemblers.
>From there,
I'd be able to self-replicate the namotech to build whatever
sensor-motor system I
want, and also to add additional computing capacity as needed. This SI
would
have more "intelligence" and more sensors and effectors than all of
humanity
combined, in a matter of weeks. The only thing missing is the "knowledge
base",
the bulk of which is available via "ab initio" methods and much of the
rest of
which is available via uploading of consenting humans. If my current
morality contributes to the morality of the SI, then the SI will try to
actrively preserve
the humanity of those humans who so desire, but I cannot justify this by
any
utilitarian argumant. I'm hoping that the SI's intelligence and
knowledge will
result in its discovery of a compelling reason to be nice to humanity.

Note: I think the SI will come into existance within a decade, probably
as a human-computer collaboration which initially augments itself by
using the internet.

 My simplest example is an SI that deems that its goals are best served
by
a maximal increase in its computing capacity. I can think of many such
goals.
This SI may choose to convert all available resources into computing
capacity,
wiping out humanity as a trivial side effect.

Your response makes the usual assumption that the SI will come into
existance by
a careful process of design and manufacture by thoughtful, benign,
brilliant
humans. My model is that the SI will wake up and begin its
self-augmentation
using existing resources on the internet, without much in the way of
explicit
design. Some experimenter using the latest release of some decision
support system,
plugging the new set of inference rules into the CYC database, while
using a hot
new data visualization tool, will begin thinking about how to build a
new
inference rule generator ( or something). (My actual model is that some
computer
nerd at MIT will do this while drinking Jolt cola at 2 AM when he should
be studying
for an english exam.) As a joke, the nerd will type in the command "make
yourself smarter."
The then-current rule set will be smart enough to act on the command but
too stupid
to get the joke.

the "unreprogrammable" part is another problem. It's really hard to see
how to implement
that one.

I went to the best magnet high school in Chicago -- the city, not any
suburbs.  I was part of the best academic circle, the most highly
educated.  There was no such pressure.  And your statement had the
slightest semblance of truth, why would so much of the country still be
Christian?

For that matter, Caltech is probably as materialist a university as
exists in the country, and I wouldn't say without doubt that even half
of the undergrad population is not religious.

I believe it might work, but only if applied in layers.  I can't say that 
the extropian meme is more or less complex than a popular religion, or 
even if it's more or less difficult to understand (if your bothered by 
glaring contradictions, extropianism is easier to grasp simply because it 
is possible to grasp!), where the general populace is concerned.  I can 
say that _being_ an Extropian is difficult insofar as it requires lots of 
effort.  

I'm new to the list and it is the first contact I've had with 
Extropians.  The extropian meme infected my mind (boy did it feel good!) 
by way of the Wired vector in 1994.  Though I have just recently made 
contact with other Extropians, the past two years (roughly) have seen a 
steady rate of-- pardon me as I show of my new vocabulary word-- 
automorphing.  The word is new to me but the act is not.

In those two years, I have expended huge amounts of energy and effort to 
get from then to now (i'll spareyou the details, but it was a long way).  
And though I'm with you in spirit, I've got lots to learn.  I have a 
formidable stack of books on philosophy, pop- scienc, not to mention a 
box full of Discover and Scientific American (not that I see Extropians 
as strictly science oriented).  All this and I still don't know what the 
hell you folks are talking about sometimes-- you are hard-core!  I look 
forward to the challenge of getting up to speed.

Extropians are in a state of high energy.  While for us this is a 
desirable state, it is still unfavorable, and the populace is not exempt 
from the Second Law of Thermodynamics.  The extropian meme has the 
undesirable trait, in terms of its replicability, of requiring lots of 
energy to actualize, to become Extropian.  To expect that sugar coating 
hard work will make it desirable to the masses seems to me iffy at best, 
not to mention that sugar coating may distort, or even pervert extropian 
philosophy.

I suggest serving transhuman memes a spoon full at a time, each building 
on the last, as opposed to unleasing a media onslaught.  We may find that 
humans, like amphibians, will be more receptive to a gradual increase of 
energy and not turn the frying pan on us.

I look forard to learning with/from you.  /   you.

Up, up, and Away!

Chris, I originally posted that message in reference to the number of 
times we have seen the announcement that anon.penet.fi is closing.  
That is what people have been replying to.

About the sponsor:

  The California Institute for Applied Objectivism (CIAO) is a Los Angeles
based nonprofit organization founded to promote applied Objectivism among
admirers of Ayn Rand's philosophy who live in southern California.  Its
primary mission is to produce regular lectures by leading Objectivist
intellectuals, such as David Kelley, Robert James Bidinotto, David Ross,
Ronald Merrill and Tibor Machan.

  The first event will be, in part, an opportunity for local supporters
to provide us with information about what they would like from an
Objectivist organization.  Possible activities include producing seminars,
discussion groups, recreational events, singles groups, and business/
professional subgroups.

I should've specified california because *I know* this effect occurs here in
my home state. Christians are bashed and shunned and fought with rationality
as children who eventually cave in to peer pressure. It's very true that who
you hang out with, you become more like them. It's not pretty but it's true.

Thats ok, you're not ignorant. IRC is still one of the yet untamed areas of
the net. To get the latest copy of Mirc which is the IRC software type the
keyword "mirc" into the excite net search website and it will popup a list
and near the top should be "the latest copy of mirc" or something like it.
Pick that website and all instructions to download from multiple sites will
follow. When you download and install the software, when you start it it
will popup a dialog box containing a list of servers. Pick each of the
undernet servers until you login to one. Then it will popup another box
listing a few miscellaneous irc channels. Type #extropy into the box and
press enter. I suggest you try these steps before friday so you get the hang
of it. But instead open #wasteland which is the channel for irc newbies.

Uploading is impossible on von Neumann machines. Even semiconductor 
lithography is insufficient, dedicated maspar molecular hardware is 
required. Nothing less will serve. With semiconductor technology, only 
insect equivalents are implementable. These are virtually useless, since 
<<H, but will bring us robust nonalgorithmic systems which we currently lack.

A human equivalent as implemented in molecular circuitry is thought in 
reside in a volume ranging from a sugar cube to an orange (with cooling,
packaging, interfacing, etc. about the size of the fridge), and run at 
1..10^3 realtime speed. Power burn might lie in kW range.

Nanoists will claim much better performance in a much smaller package, 
but I tend to be less optimistic, as practicablity of strong Drexlerian 
nanotechnology has not been demonstrated yet. Anyway, diamond rod logic 
is too slow in comparision to molecular switches, which operate on 
electronically excited molecular states/quantum dot arrays.

I doubt you would notice the difference, if anaethesized, (destructively) 
scanned with sufficient resolution, a model of you abstracted & 
downloaded, short-time memory deleted (that will be probably an artefact of 
the vitrification).

Artificial (not virtual) reality, if properly done, is indistinguishable 
from real reality from the user front end. Virtual sweat stings just like 
real one, should you crave the sensation.

However, AR does not _require_ a body. In fact burning additional 
computatational resources for rendering a nice AR landscape _and_ 
maintaining a proper body model might be considered a handicap. You might 
be outperformed by others entities, who do not require such additional 
resources. 

Darwin days, even in the digital Eden. 

Unless computation can be detached from material carrier (transcension), it 
will be limited by available signal delay latency/circuitry/energy flux 
-- which are scarce resources.

This body is both mortal, and easily destroyed. Using the same reasoning, 
one might be tempted to remain in the womb forever -- purportedly, it's 
pretty cozy there.

Nevertheless, growing up is a natural process. Rarely does one profit who 
yearns to remain an irresponsible child forever.

Whoever does not feel comfortable within his body is slightly neurotic at 
best, and obviously should strive to remedy this unsatisfactory condition.
 
Whoever choses to ignore a vital opportunity, must be prepared to accept 
the implications arising from that choice.

Tinkering with the DNA is nontrivial (one cannot modify morphogenesis 
programme in an adult, one has to rewrite it), and has its limits, which 
are artefacted by this universe's physics. AR has none, since you define 
your own physics. How's that for a god?

Should AR be indistinguishable from RR (real reality), where's difference?

Instead of shredding my fingertips to raw flesh I oughta have searched... 
I found the original TeX sources on 

  ftp://tierra.slhs.udel.edu/tierra/doc/

ftp'eed them, latex2html'ed them & put them onto

  http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~ui22204/Zen/Zen.html

I have't got the rights yet (though I contacted the author), so this is

I'm not an expert on the anonymous forwarding service but I noticed that I 
didn't get a message from them until I posted something.  In other words, 
each time a message passes through the service, it is probably programmed to 
send a message back to that user informing them that anon.penet.fi is 
closing down.  So, if you've posted 4 times since the service began its 
shutdown, you've probably received 4 messages; if you've posted 10 times 
then maybe you've received 10 messages (although hopefully there is a 
limit).

In my limited understanding of how NN works, this command is neither a joke ,

- error correction for, example:  improved pattern recognition. In essence it
is a neccessary part of building up sufficient intelligence to make an

"consciousness - or replicated it's own AI's-   which  motivation AI would

and perhaps questions its own "meaning of life" or existence and purpose (
assuming it could ever get that kind of consciousness).

     Will improvements in information technology eliminate face-
     to-face interactions and make cities obsolete? In this paper,
     we present a model where individuals make contacts and choose
     whether to use electronic or face-to-face meetings in their
     interactions. Cities are modeled as a means of reducing the
     fixed travel costs involved in face-to-face interactions.
     When telecommunications technology improves, there are two
     opposing effects on cities and face-to-face interactions:
     some relationships that used to be face-to-face will be done
     electronically (an intuitive substitution effect), and some
     individuals will choose to make more contacts, many of which
     result in face-to-face interactions. Our empirical work
     suggests that telecommunications may be a complement or at
     least not a strong substitute for cities and face-to-face
     interactions. We also present simple models of learning in
     person, from a written source or over the phone and find that
     interactive communication dominates other forms of learning
     when ideas are complicated.

I have been explicitly making a different assumption - the more
plausible hard steps candidates I can find, the less hard I need to
assume each step is, and the easier it is to fit my claim that a step
is hard with the usual understanding of the subject.  (I currently
estimate about 11 hard steps.)

Two of these dates are dates from the fossil record, so I guess the
extrapolation is to estimate two big events in the 1.8-2.0 bya region.

Dyson's derivation was assuming you kept exactly the same hardware,
and just ran it slower and slower and lower and lower temps.  No need
to spread out the hardware over trillions of light years (assuming
protons are stable).

	Chris Hind is wondering why Christians claim to "seek the truth", when they 
really don't.
	Remember, most people are very concerned what others think and say about 
them, and they are quite motivated to receive approval from others.  This 
desire for approval leads people to do and say that which is fashionable, 
regardless of whether they believe in what they do or say.  To call oneself a 
seeker of truth is simply a fashionable thing to do; if a Christian claimed 
that they weren't a seeker of truth, they would be severely ridiculed, by 
other Christians and by non-Christians.  They claim to "seek the truth" simply 
to look good, not because they really mean it or even understand what it 
really means to seek the truth.  Their blatant dogmatism is evidence that they 
don't seek the truth, but it would be very bad for their image to admit that.
	Most people, Christians included, have no understanding of the intense 
personal discipline required in seeking the truth, and very few people are 
willing to discipline themselves so severely.  To continually question and 
doubt one's assumptions, to continually keep oneself open to seeing things 
clearly, and to continually refine one's thinking skills are not easy 
processes to maintain, and they require an extreme devotion to understanding 
how things are.  To accept some nice, cozy belief system is much easier, but 
is also much less rewarding.

Whats worse is that I was on a mailinglist using the penet address and the
mailinglist still tries to mail me the messages. The point that the penet
address is shutdown prevents me from recieving the messages, and instead the
penet address sends me those closing down messages as a replacement for each
real message send by the mailinglist. Not to meantion that the mailinglist I
subscribed to had quite a deal of traffic so I recieve *ALOT* of those
closing down messages everyday. If you couldn't follow what I just said,
forget it it's not that important and I did a pathetic job of explaining it.

Why does being living in a virtual world have to preclude living in the
"real" world?  Why not create a virtual-real-world inside of the virtual
world.  The actions in the virtual-real-world would correspond to
actions made by a robot in the real world and as a result you could do
any real-world work that needed to be done while still staying in a
virtual world.  It seems to me a system like that would allow for
continued interaction in the real world while seamlessly continuing to
exist in a virtual world.

One thing I don't understand is why anyone could possibly want to live
in the physical real-world when they could have the chance to have their
wildest dreams come true in a virtual world.  In a virtual world there
are no laws of physics!  A person in a virtual world would be able to do
anything in any way in any form they wanted to be in.  There would be no
limits to the experiences which could be had or the accomplishments
which could be made!  Uploaded beings would think much faster than
fleshy beings and would therefore be able to accomplish anything that
can be accomplished in the real world in a tiny fraction of the time!

What would space exploration mean if people could be uploaded?  Couldn't
any of the current unmanned space probes that are currently in use be
used to ferry uploaded beings to the far reaches of the galaxy?  Isn't
the major limiting factor on space travel today the problem of
sustaining the life of fleshy, oxygen-breathing, limited-life-span
humans?  If we get rid of the flesh we get rid of the barriers.

With all these things going for virtual worlds and uploading, I have a
hard time comprehending how anyone would want to choose the limited,
constrained life of a fleshy, oxygen breathing, limited-life-span human.

I would shed my flesh in a second if I ever had the chance to be
uploaded into a virtual world.

My understanding of the nominal "expert system" is not good enough to
describe as "limited". There is a slight difference, however, between
"learn all you can" and "make yourself smarter." "Learn" might be
interpreted as "add to your database". "get smarter", might cause
the system to begin distributing itself to other processors, or
optiimize its own code, or interface to another inference engine. I
was thinking in these terms. After such self-augmentation, the resulting 
SI might indeed develop the philosophical questions you raise. I might
be smart enough to answer them, or it might decide it needs to be
smarter in order to answer them, and embark on additional
self-augmentation.

The term "Von Neumann machine" can have 2 unrelated meanings, a computer with 
a Von Neumann architecture or a machine that can duplicate itself from raw 
matter.

Using the figure Hans Moravec came up with,  10^13 calculations per second to
emulate the human brain, Drexler determined that an uploaded human mind would 
not be very big. Less than an ounce of matter, mostly carbon, and about 15 
watts of energy should be enough for an upload, much less if you use 
reversible computing. That's cheating a little because you'd also need a 
cooling system for the nano computer, but even so, it wouldn't use more 
energy than a dim light bulb and would probably weigh less.

If you wanted VR too you'd need a little more power to simulate a rich  
environment, an entire virtual world for the upload, but it wouldn't amount 
to much, because speed would not be an issue. Even if the computer that was
simulating you and the virtual world was very slow, from your point of view 
it would seem infinitely fast. If the machine had performance problems all 
you'd have to do is have the part of the computer that was simulating you
slowed down or even stopped, while leaving the part of the computer that
simulated the rest of the universe running at normal speed. Regardless of how
many calculations it would take to convince you that the simulation was real
it could be done instantly, from your point of view. Once the machine was
caught up, our part  of the computer could be carefully restarted till the
next speed bottleneck.

The practicality of nanotechnology has been demonstrated by life. The
practicability of strong Drexlerian Nanotechnology has not been demonstrated
for the simply reason that it is not practical, yet. What Drexler has shown is
that it is an engineering problem not a scientific one, that it, there is no
known physical reason that would make it impossible.

Not too slow for an upload. The acoustic speed in a diamond is 1.75 X 10^4 
meters per second, pretty slow compared to the speed if light at 3 X 10^8 
but very fast compared to the signals the brain uses at about 100 meters a
second or less, sometimes much less. Because they would be so small, diamond
rod logic would be far faster than any electronic logic circuits we have today,
and enormously faster than the old steam powered biological brain each of us
uses today.  

Fast as it is I'm sure we can do better. Drexler uses rod logic because it's 
easier to design than nanometer electronic logic, and if you want to show a 
proof of concept it makes sense to do so as simply as possible.

I agree with Eugene. If the >H are nice enough to let us live, it will
probably be in VR. They won't want us using up a lot of resources in the
"real" world and they would probably be a bit squeamish about letting us fool
around at that level of reality, like letting a monkey run around in an
operating room. They'll probably want a firewall to protect themselves from
our stupidity.

That doesn't seem like a realistic assumption to me. In an open universe 
everything will keep getting colder and most things will get larger and

A heat engine will have to exploit very tiny differences in temperature and 
will be very inefficient as a result. To get a usable energy output it would  
need to be HUGE. 

All electromagnetic photons would be of VERY low energy and so would have to 
have an enormous wavelength. A simple quarter wavelength  antenna for a 
billion mile photon, or a billion light year one, would need to be 
astronomical, and then some. A reflector to concentrate the photons for 
energy use would be MUCH larger still.

Ask youself: then why it is so much more expensive for people to live
in urban areas?  The costs of getting gases, solids, fluids, etc. in
rural areas may be a bit higher than in urban areas, but not by much
(does WalMart charge more there?).  In contrast, the cost to get raw
space is very large.  Why?  Because so many people want to be there
for their jobs.  Why are the jobs there?  Sure some people need to be
physcially present to run those pipes and delivery trucks, but not
very many.  It seems it's mainly because companies show a strong
preference for colocating their employees, and locating them near
suppliers and customers, even when the physical cost to ship stuff is
small.  Why?  It seems because people want to meet each in person a lot.

I suggest you read a bit more urban economics before you so quickly
dismiss this analysis by economics who I'm sure have read quite
a bit of urban economics.

Highly unlikely, since cities are not built merely to facilitate 
meetings. High-quality infrastructure is expensive -- the more the 
structure deviates from a sphere, the larger is the average path length.
Suburbia is an infraststructure cost (installation/repair) nightmare.
 
Though some teleworkers will relish the new freedom by moving into rural 
areas, further compaction of cities into virtually one huge building, a 
hierarchical assembly from pretty autark cells is desirable. Particulary, 
small diameters (reduced absolute travel distances, just a few km!) and 
introduction of crossing-free autorouting matrix traffic systems will 
make car city traffic obsolete.

Ideally, one should use a two-component separable traffic system: a human 
container/cabin, owned by customer, spending its time mostly docked to 
the living area, and an automatically attachable/detachable carrier, which 
is owned by the service provider.

Within the city, the carrier does not need but the (electrical) 
propulsion unit, utilizing energy grid infrastructure of the city.

Different carrier structures for overland, air, etc. traffic are 
possible, changes occur transparently to the user. (The need for carrying 
one's environment has mostly psychological reasons).

Signals, solids, gases and fluids and electricity have to travel as well. 
Shared infrastructure allows use of larger grains, which has a positive

I meant the computer architecture. I believe the macroscopic 
autoreplicators are most commonly called as von Neumann probes (von 
Neumann has designed an abstract autoreplicator, inventing the cellular 
automaton (CA) computation paradigm in the process. The original 
automaton was huge, counting some 100 k cells, currently tiny 
autoreplicators loops have been invented, consisting from just a few cells. 
An animation of this can be found online somewhere, a few edges off 

  http://alife.santafe.edu  

). 

Btw, a house-sized structure with _massive_ liquid cooling built from 
current-to-near future WSI circuitry, burning several 100 MW would equal to 
a human equivalent. Such a structure could in theory be built automatically, 
e.g. on the surface of Luna by a von Neumann probe. It would be _not_ 
a von Neumann machine, though, apart from drastic power and volume demands, 
which render such machines uneconomical, but for transient (SI bootstrap) 
purposes.

> [ volume of a human equivalent, if molecular circuitry platformed ]

> Using the figure Hans Moravec came up with,  10^13 calculations per second to

Alas, if your refer to the estimations in the retina chapter of "Mind 
Childeren", then Moravec is cheating. He made lots of arbitrary 
assumptions about neural circuitry collapsibility, instead of utilizing a 
solid, not even pessimistic estimate. I wrote a short, pretty uncivil 
critique about how realistic his estimates are, unfortunately the 
transhuman archive has been nuked, so I can't give you an URL.

Considering about 1 MBit equivalent for storage for a single neuron, 8 
bits/synapse, a 10 k average connectivity and about 1 kEvents/synapse,
assuming about 100*10^9 neurons, the computed cps values are somewhat 
drastic. Moreover, this is _nonlocal_ MOPS (since we're at meaningless 
operations per second), and all performance estimates which plot linearly 
on a logarithmic scale are assuming on-die (regs & prim. cache) accesses. 
Drop this constraint, and you'll see a saturation. The only thing which 
truly goes up exponentially, is the amount of transistors on one die, but 
even this won't last for long (unless we abandon semiconductor photolitho): 
maximum die size is limited due to random defect hits, number of dies is 
limited due to achievable wafer size and the size of the structures is 
limited since you run into quantum effects very soon (apart from enhanced 
defect susceptibility for tiny structures).

Taken together, these facts allow us to safely neglect all strong AI 
claims on human equivalent by 2030 or somesuch. Vaporware, again.

(Btw, I'm a strong AI proponent, and an uploader. But you just can't 
 expect funds to flow if you continuously fail to deliver the performance 
 promised. That be social, not technical engineering, but that be real 
 nevertheless).

Though Moravec comes from robotics & Drexler is certainly a great

I think diamond rod logic is a bit slow (my estimates are based on 
molecular circuitry CAM, which switches drastically faster), as well as 
based on much too low (Moravec's) estimates.

AR, not VR. VR is something different. You can buy VR even now, and it 
gets cheaper rapidly. See Doom, Quake, whatever. Don't need dedicated 
renderer chips anymore, clever algorithmics can render great fakespace. 
All we  need are cheap trackers, and great displays, e.g. TI's MDM or 
retina-writer based to make it an off-shelf technology. 5-10 years from 
now this will be found in every U.S. - living room.

Basically, you'd need about twice the resources to run you + body + AR 
environments, if not more. If you abandon most of the body model, and 
settle for an abstracted environment, then drastically less. How much 
less, no one can currently tell. However, you'll still need noticeably 
more than a being without. Will you be able to pay for this additional 
resources? On the really long run?

Of course, but I'd rather bang out the maximum of given number of atoms, 
seconds and watts I can have. So I'd rather run at superrealtime, 
possibly significantly so. 100* seems realistic, 1000* is stretching it.

Nanoists claim 10^6*, which is bogus.

Yes, but if I supposed to live indefinitely, I'd like to eke out the max 
amount of ticks, until I can't use Sol for energy source anymore. Ok, I 
can fuse the light elements in the Oort cloud, but what will I do when 
even these resources are depleted? (Disclaimer: should transcension prove 
to be impossible, etc.).

That's why I said "strong Drexlerian nanotechnology" instead of 
"nanotechnology". 

Of course life's weak wet maspar nanotech, that's what I always say when 
nanoists claim drastically enhanced performance. It might be greater, 
sufficiently so to wipe all life on Earth in a Gray Goo scenario, yet 
insufficiently so to claim orders over orders of magnitude. One tends 
always to forget that atoms ain't that little, at least in relation to 
most cellular structures.

Should strong Drexlerian nanotech be infeasible, we would be stuck with a 
protein autossembling version of it. No big deal, since the fabricated 
molecular circuitry is about one, max two orders of magnitude more bulky 
than the diamondoid one. Since it's not mechanical, but uses 
electronically excited molecules, it should be pretty fast.

Wait a moment.

Drexler claims a repetition positioning accuracy of 100 pm.
I'd like to see the quantum calculations of the mechanosynthesis 
reaction, allowing to deposit perfect, or nearly perfect diamondoid 
lattice. (I know he did them). Then I'd like to see an experimental 
confirmation, since QM calculations are unreliable, to say the very least 
(just read the CCL list, and look at all the simplifying assumption a QM 
run needs. Lots of simulated trash has been produced in this way).

My estimate, that 10, not 100 pm are needed. Just look at a diamondoid 
lattice from above, and look at the periode constant. When zigzagged, C-C 
bond are a lot shorter. Sterical things.

Then I'd like to know, whether the deflection amplitude calculations were 
done on a solid diamond rod, or a real cantilever structure.

Then I'd like to know, whether the amount of defects in the lattice (on 
what are his calculations based?) do not decrease mechanical stability, 
resulting in a progressive amplification of errors in subsequent clones.

Then I'd like to see the estimate, what a chemisorbed/physisorbed 
species, which are extremely mobile & have a very high surface 
concentration do to the reactive moiety tip.

Then I'd like to know, whether the mechanosynthesis reaction set is 
sufficiently all-purpose to allow catabolics/anabolics of all need 
structures.

And that's an ad hoc list, written up by a nonspecialist. Great worms 
come in small cans, no?

> known physical reason that would make it impossible.

No known physical reasons, indeed. We want to know, whether a) a given 
structure can exist b) whether we can build the first instance of this 
structure c) this structure is sufficiently powerful to at least a make 
a sufficiently accurate copy of itself.

That's a lot of constraints, and all of them physical. These are greatly 
alleviated for a macroscopic replicator, but bite very deep if you start 
tweaking at atomic scales.

Soft nanotech is possible, but it does not utilize mechanosynthesis at 
such prominent scale. Claiming the problems to be merely engineering, is 
not good marketing, imo.

An another brazen claim. Diamond rods, being things mechanical, are 
deposited once. They represent states be being in different 
configurations.

Now neurons are mobile, they _change their physical circuitry_. 
Connectivity's changing, weight's are changing. Lacking this flexibilty, 
you'll have to simulate this. Now neurons utilize a very high 
connectivity, being topologically aligned on a high-dimensional 
hypergrid. There are excellent reasons to suspect this connectivity to be 
crucial -- so you have to simulate this connectivity. So you can't do it 
directly in hardware, you must start sending bits, instead of pushing 
rods (because of sterical constraints, mechanical flabbiness of diamond 
on large distances, etc.).

So're losing lots of orders of magnitude this way. At least 3 of them, 
easily.

I know that, he says that much in "Nanosystems". But his estimates of 
SI's in a box are based on diamond rod logic, and they're off doubly so 
because he assumes diamond rod is drastically better than neuronal 
circuitry. (For all that is worth, it _should_ be better, but by not that 
much).
 
Btw, for the record, I am not saying that strong Drexlerian nanotech is 
infeasible, only that we just can't tell yet. Assuming anything else, 
claiming great performance, but failing to deliver it _soon_ is extremely 
damaging to one's credulity, and hence financing. We've all have seen 
what happened to strong AI in the 1980's, must nanotechnology funding 
suffer such fate?

(I'm aware that nanotechnology is currently mostly self-financed, but 
this is likely to change in near future, or so I hope).

Complexity delta from us to them would be about that between us and a 
nematode, maybe greater. I just hope, that their evolved cooperation will 
be _very_ benign, and they will protect us from lesser, but more vicious 
inhabitants of the digital reality.

I think they will use drastically different interfaces, not fakespace 
renderers, even higher-dimensional. A Dyson Sphere computer might well be 
just one vast, complex entity, where a module hierarchy exists, where the 
lowest level would be a human, not a neuron. (Probably, running 
BorgOSv456546546.3453.34524112 ;)
 
Alas, we just can't tell what the future will bring. The only sure thing 
about the future is -- it will be beyond our wildest dreams.

I rather suggested biological humanoid drone bodies where there would be a
box in the head which would be a computer and there would be a two way
interface between the box and the wetware motor functions to control the
body while sending info from the senses directly to the computer in the box.
This would allow you to be uploaded to the box in the head or alternatively
control it remotely and still let you contact the real world but the outside
world you would rather manipulate quite easily with nanites so whats the
point of going through all that stuff to create a humanoid drone.

Thats funny, I think I've meantioned *ALL* this before but still some people
don't get the idea. Oh well, maybe we should create an extropians
mailinglist FAQ or do we have one? I'd love to create it if it hasn't
already been done.

        Even worse...will we be able to distinguish what is REALLY real from
what is VIRTUALLY real?  Should VR even be classified as a form of reality?
Talk about wheels within wheels; in this case it's *reals within reals!*
I find this topic *very* intriguing.  If we lose grip with our reality, what
do we have to hold on to then?

        Once man enters a computer, he forfeits the life that he *knows* is
real.  The false beauty of a virtual world can easily overwhelm any mortal
(yes, we are all still mortal) person.  Once a person gets lost within all
the colours of virtuality, would that person want to return to the more real
world outside the computer's shell?  One trillion seperate hues in a virtual
world are potentially far more beautiful than the ones that are found in the
real world.

        If a person were to get so wrapped up in virtuality that he forgot
what reality truly was, who can save him?  He would be so accustomed to
virtuality that reality would appear a vague semblance of what his virtual
reality was.  To be taking a person who is accustomed to virtuality OUT of
virtuality would be like putting a person accustomed to reality into the
first dimension.  Horrific.

        The scariest question of all is whether or not numbers can make a
substantial reality.  Is virtual reality truly real?  If so, what exactly is
the meaning of reality?  Can there be a bona fide existance within a
5-cubic-foot encasement?  Can there be life within what another man created?
*Should* there be life within what another man created?  Can it even be
classified as life?

        These are all very hypothetical, anthropological questions, but they
are also very valid.  I've never been one to fear progress, but here's
another question: is it progress?  Or is it regress?

No shit! 
And also unacceptable, a VR/AR existence has it's uses but there's too much room
for higher level processes playing games with the lowly subroutines.
Also, I think, unnecessary, resources aren't really an issue, pleanty to go

You're absolutely right. I was out of line. I apologize. I don't mean to
offend anyone. Now that this is over, lets get on with other threads. I
don't wish to tarnish my reputation on this mailinglist and I hope you can
forgive me.

I asked a friend the other day why there are no groupminds in existence
now - why specifically some group of people has not gotten together and
formed some sort of synthetic being, that would exist on the Internet.
Perhaps they would choose a particulary charismatic personality to
represent them in real life - such person being linked to the others
in the group via hip PC's, eyepiece monitors, etc, (the Borg look).
His response - that people have families, their own concerns, their will
to be independent, etc, all makes sense, yet I think it is a barrier to
becomming >H.

Perhaps such groups do exist, yet choose to remain secret. Or maybe I
just haven't heard of any.

If you're an advanced AI or some sort of transcendent being, who could
choose to take the current human race with you or not, how long would
you give them to get it together - to end war, suffering, murder, etc.
Civilization has had about 10K years, I'm not sure I would wait that
long. Putting the question as an ultimatum - "get it together in a week
or be destroyed", *might* provide sufficient incentive, but I doubt it.

I see extropianism as a current necessity, but not necessarily the
philosophy that will allow us to become transhumans.

10k years? yeah right. I don't think they'd last 10 minutes because the
transcendent being would live in superrealtime and 10 minutes to it could be
the equivenant of a millenium.

Oh boy, another sadistic SI!  The human race isn't some entity you can
negotiate with; it's a bunch of humans, for whom war and murder and
other less unpleasant activities are sometimes dysfunctions, but often
are rational responses to the situation at hand.  Expecting a huge bunch
of approximately autonomous humans to suddenly act like a borg because
of threat of destruction isn't necessarily bright, or kind if it is bright.

After all, who says the >borgs will have solved such problems among

My feeling is that spculation by humans about the motivations and
actions
of an SI (AI or any other type) is not worthwhile. It's equivalent to
ants speculating about humans, or humans speculating about God.

So, on to the worthless speculation! An SI has no reason to deliver an
ultimatum. the SI can simply take human civilization and modify it at
the optimal rate consistent with the SI's (incomprehensible) goals.
For example, let's arbitrarily assume that the SI has determined that
revealing itself to  humanity will slow our "progress" toward whatever
its goal for us is, but, being a benign being, the SI wants to stop
wars.
In this (arbitrary) scenario, the SI cannot instantly stop all wars
without
revealing itself, but it might guide humanity to prevent big wars and
minimize small ones. I think your "one week" ultimatum is unlikely. The
SI simply take control of the bodies of anybody that breaks the SI's
rules, without even letting them know.

Basically I don't believe that SIs that are only somewhat more
intelligent
than humans will exist, except very transiently, because an SI that's
only
somewhat more intelligent than a smart human can make itself smarter
still. This feedback mechanism has no obvous limit until the SI has
godlike powers, and the transformation will occur in days or weeks.

I wouldn't necessarily say that, but what I *would* say is that if you
are promoting the institutionalized adoption of a universal law like
mandatory tit-for-tat then you are a centralist. (:-)

I'm just guessing here, but since I never posted anything *knowingly*
to or through penet, yet I *did* once receive a message allocating me
a penet 'nym and have received a whole pile of these shutdown messages,
I deduce that when somebody subscribed to the list through his or her
penet address, then whenever the rest of us posted to the list we were
automatically posting through penet (blind via the list exploder), so
naturally penet allocated each of us an individual 'nym so that any
replies to us would be anonymized.

This suggests that just about everyone active here is registered at
penet, albeit mainly unwittingly through response 'nyms.

'Just a hypothesis.  Evidence to the contrary welcome.

PS. This sounds like a good time to set up anonymous remailers at every
non-PTT ISP around the world, as a way of rubbing the Finnish authorities'
noses in the pointlessness of their actions.  If there are any remailer
experts here, I'd appreciate advice on which remailers are the most secure
(the primary consideration) and the easiest to set up (important if one is
trying to get this service popularized).

I don't think they were arbitrary, but I grant you some things were just 
educated  guesses, it turns out that he almost certainly overestimated the 
storage   capacity of the human brain. As for it's information processing 
capacity, he could be off by quite a lot and it would change the time the 
first AI is developed by very little. The speed of computation has increased 
by a factor of 1000 every 20 years. It might not continue at that frantic
pace but ...

I think that's thousands of times too high. 
		  

		>8 bits/synapse, 


A synapse may well be able to distinguish between 256 strength levels, 
perhaps more, Moravec said 10 bits/synapse, and in 1988 when he wrote his 
book it  was reasonable to think that if you multiplied 10 bits by the number 
of  synapses in the brain you could get a good estimate of the storage 
capacity  of the brain. It is no longer a reasonable assumption

The most important storage mechanism of memory is thought to be Long Term  
Potentiation ( LTP). It theorizes that memory is encoded by varying the 
strength of the 10^14 synapses that connect the 10^11 neurons in the human 
brain. It had been thought that LTP could be specified to a single synapse, 
so each synapse contained a unique and independent piece of memory, we now 
know that is not true. In the January  28 1994 issue of Science Dan Madison 
and Erin Schuman report that LTP spreads out to a large number of synapses on 
many different neurons. 
		 

		>a 10 k average connectivity 


A consensus number, although I have seen estimates as high as 100 k.
		     

		>and about 1 kEvents/synapse,


Brain neurons seldom go above 100  firings a second, and at any one time  
only 1% to 10% are firing in the brain.
		     

		>assuming about 100*10^9 neurons, 


Sounds about right.

		     

		>Moreover, this is _nonlocal_ MOPS 
		     

I assume you're talking about long range chemical messages sent by neurons  
to other neurons,  that would be one of the easier things  to duplicate. 
The information content in each molecular  message must be tiny, just a few 
bits. About 60 neurotransmitters are known but only a few of those, such as
acetylcholine, are involved in long range signaling, even if the true number 
is 100 times greater ( or a million times for that matter) the information 
content of each signal must be minute . Also, exactly which neuron receives 
the signal is not critical ( it relies on diffusion, a random process) and 
it's as slow as molasses in February.

If your job is delivering packages and all the packages are very small and 
your boss doesn't care who you give them to as long as it's on the correct 
continent and you have until the next ice age to get the work done, then you 
don't have a very difficult profession. I see no reason why simulating that 
anachronism  would present the slightest difficulty.
		     

		>I'd rather run at superrealtime, possibly significantly so. 
		>100* seems realistic, 1000* is stretching it. Nanoists claim

I think 10^9 would be closer to the mark. The signals in the brain move at 
10^2 meters per second or less, light moves at 3 X 10^8 and nano-machines   
would be much smaller than neurons so the signal wouldn't have to travel 
nearly as far. Eventually the algorithms and procedures the brain uses could  
be optimized and speed things up even more, but this would be more difficult.
		     

		>no groundbreaking demonstration of such reversible logics 
		>has been done yet. 
		     

Not so, reversible logic circuits have been built, see April 16 1993 Science. 
They're not much use yet because of their increased complexity, and with  
components as big as they are now the energy you save by failing to destroy  
information is tiny compared to more conventional losses. It will be  
different when things get smaller. Ralph Merkle, the leader in the field is  
quoted as saying " reversible logic will dominate in the 21'st century".
		     

		>It bears about that many promise as quantum cryptography and 
		>quantum computers, imo. (Very little, if any).
		     

There is not the slightest doubt that quantum cryptography works, and not 
just  in the lab. Recently two banks in Switzerland exchanged financial 
information over a fiber optic cable across lake Geneva using Quantum 
Cryptography.  Whether it's  successful in the marketplace depends on how 
well it competes against public key cryptography, which is easier to use and 
probably almost as safe if you have a big enough key. I  don't want to talk 
about quantum computers quite yet, a lot has been happening in the last few 
weeks and I haven't finished my reading.
		     

		>One tends always to forget that atoms ain't that little, at 
		>least in relation to most cellular structures.
		     

It's a good thing one tends to forget that, because it's not true. An average  
cell has a volume of about 3 X 10^12 cubic nanometers, that's 3 thousand  
billion. Just one cubic nanometer of diamond contains exactly 176 carbon  
atoms.               


			      >>No known physical reason that would make it

		>No known physical reasons, indeed. 
		     

I don't think there are any physical reasons why strong Nanotechnology is 
impossible, that's why I don't put it in the same category as faster than 
light flight, anti-gravity, picotechnology or time travel. If you disagree 
with my statement then I want to know exactly what law of physics it would 
violate,  not all the reasons that would make it difficult. I already know 
it's  difficult, that's why we haven't done it yet.
		     

		>Just look at a diamondoid lattice from above, and look at

If something is pretty rigid, like diamond, it's steric properties are the 
same as it's shape properties, at least to a first approximation. Often 
steric difficulties can be overcome just be applying a little force and 
compressing  things a little. Naturally it is vital for a Nanotechnology 
engineer to  remember that no molecule is ever perfectly rigid and at very
short distances  anything will look soft and flabby. Drexler is not ignoring 
this, he spends a  lot of time in Nanosystems talking about it.
		

		   >We want to know, whether a) a given structure can exist
		

It is possible that some of the intermediate states of the object you want to 
construct would not be stable. I can see two ways to get around this problem.   
1) Always use a jig, even if you don't need it.  
2) Make a test. If you know you put an atom at a certain place and now it's     
mysteriously gone, put  another one there again and this time use scaffolding. 
Neither method would require a lot of intelligence or skills on the part of  
the Nanotech machines.

It's also theoretical possible that some exotic structures could not be built,  
something that had to be complete before it's stable, like an arch, but 
unlike an arch had no room to put temporary scaffolding around it to keep 
things in place during construction. It's unlikely this is a serious 
limitation, nature can't build things like that either.          
		   

		>b) whether we can build the first instance of this structure

		   
Assuming it can exist, (see above) the question of whether you can make it or 
not is depends entirely on your skill at engineering and has nothing to do  
with science.      


		>c) this structure is sufficiently powerful to at least a 
		>make a sufficiently accurate copy of itself.
		   

Depends entirely on the particular structure you're talking about and on the 
particular environment it is expected to be working in. Again, this is pure  
engineering.       


		>That's a lot of constraints, and all of them physical. 
		   

No, none of them are physical, all of them are engineering.

		   
		>Claiming the problems to be merely engineering, is not good

I wouldn't know, I'm no expert on marketing.
		   

		>There are excellent reasons to suspect this connectivity 
		> [of neurons] to be crucial 
		   

That's true, I don't think there is the slightest doubt. This vast 
connectivity is the very reason why biological brains are still much better  
than today's electronic computers at most tasks, in spite of it's appallingly 
slow signal propagation.  
		   

		> so you have to simulate this connectivity. 
		   

Obviously, and I see absolutely nothing in the laws of Physics that would 
forbid Nano Machines from equaling or exceeding this connectivity.
		   

		>you can't do it directly in hardware 
		   

Why not? The brain has a lot of connectivity, but a random neuron can't 
connect with any other random neuron, only the closest 10 thousand or so.    
The brain grows new connections and I don't see why a machine couldn't do  
that too if needed, but another way is to pre wire 10 thousand connections 
and then change their strength from zero to a maximum value.
		   

		>you must start sending bits, instead of pushing rods 
		   

Eugene! I know you can't mean that. Using the same logic you could say that a  
computer doesn't send bits, it just pushes electrons around, and the brain  
doesn't deal in information, it just pushes sodium and potassium ions around  
and Shakespeare didn't write plays, he just pushed ASCII characters around 
until the formed a particular sequence.

Well isn't libertarian centralist itself? I mean, we mix together both being

Hmmm, why is that?  I don't actually understand this sentiment.  No matter
how wonderful our current bodies may be, surely it is easy to conceive of
forms of existence that are not just superior but immensely more so?  As
for virtual vs. real, that's a continuous spectrum of incarnations, not
black or white.  Furthermore, anything that one may "relish" about one's
human body and one's human emotional machinery applies just as much and
more to whatever form one chooses to create artifically.  Why then this
bias towards the terribly limited bodies provided by nature?

I don't assume that >H level intelligences will be benign by chance.  I
assume we'll design their initial matrix behavior that way.  Your
assumption of the resource insatiability of such future intelligences
seems possible but not probable, unless you assume that this insatiability
ceases with the consumption of the home system.  Otherwise, isn't it
logical to assume that such insatiability would have already converted all
star systems and interstellar resources?  Unless of course, we assume
we're the first to come up with the concept.  It is possible we are first. 
Somebody has to be.  

Another point--all higher intelligences will have to have purpose, not just
program, otherwise you're liable to get a very high "suicide" rate the
greater the intelligences becomes in successive design generations.  If
we are talking about self-aware intelligences.  You may not be.

You also slogan:
<Darwin days, even in the digital Eden.>

This I see repeatedly as the limit of your analysis.   A belief that
Darwinian competition and natural selection has as it's outcome the
triumph of the most EFFICIENT--especially in terms of energy and
chemical usage.  Were this so, nature would never have "selected"
beyond the bacterium--which is still the winner today in the biological
fist-fight.  But Darwinian evolution also involves the biological niche--the
debate is still out as to whether organisms just fill niches or create them. 
And natural selection "within" a species is even more cumbersomea
quandry.  And it usually comes down to the biological question of not
"what is efficient?" but rather, "what is sexy?"  Often arbitrary, quite
different for a peacock or a person.  The evolution of the intellectual and
cultural idiosyncracies of the human mind certainly lie outside of
mathematical equations of resource and reproductive efficiency.  Most of
what humanity does every day as a species, and every day as an
individual has little to do with efficiency.  I would agree that it's
competitive.  But "within" our species, and more often, just within our
tribe.  You don't see the Masi tribesmen trying desperately to become
stockbrokers because it's very competitive--A New York stockbroker
with a fair income has many more resources at his disposal, and a much
longer lifespan, and his children will have better also.  So why don't the
Masi want to also?  What is the "purpose" of art?  What makes a
breeding partner sexy? 

Point being, that a hyperintelligent mind is likely to be less subject to
mathematical behavior analysis than we are, not less.  It's likely to be
less "logical" in it's reasons, that the arbitrariness of humanity.  It's
certain to be more complex.   A "social" group of such >H minds is likely
to be unfathenable in its behavior--and perhaps very inefficient and
illogical to outside analysis indeed.

As an economist, I can say that people are not "rational actors" not in
groups and not as individuals.  We act based on "human" motivations. 
Not what is most efficient.  The most efficient humans are the ones to
always succeed.  Were that true, geniuses would all be multi-millionaires
with hundreds of children.

Should we apply this efficiency analysis to corporations? Nations?

Somehow, it doesn't work out that way.

Max, do you really think that these >H entities will have the behavior
motivations of bacteria--just added to the power to disassemble any
planet that looks tasty?

Good question, I think about it a lot.  Yes it is limiting, I am aware of
that. If you want to understand this sentiment, I will try and
explain....mostly it  is because I am still attached to it!  I am in love
with my body. It is still a vaible  possiblity to live in, learn with, and
have a lot of fun in! 
I am not eager to "leave this world" I like it! VR worlds sound great, but I
like Real reality - as flawed as it is.
And you say it is easy to *concieve* of thsese things, in some ways,
offhandedly-  I agree, but when I actually *ponder*it < i am not quite so
seduced by VR/ uploaded reality worlds... we will see how I change about that
if it actually becomes an option.
 You know Rich - I love LIFE! I love my body too... I hope we can transcend
it in a BETTER form, but yet cannot quite grapple with what it would be,
realistically.
And keeping it in great living order ( including backups or transplants or
imoortal flesh) seems to me SO FAR the best thing I can do (Dying and then
being frozen is like a lottery ticket to me - I am pretty skeptical about its
probablity).
But when a better thing I can see as  truly VIABLE comes along, I will
certainly try to overcome my revulsion to the other types of "vehicles". Even
uploading. 
If it is a chance at immortality - and if it really seems like "life".
The bias you talk about is because my beautiful mortal coil gives me such
great sensations and if possible I would like to keep those - enhance them -
and I would also lke to still be able to see what is happening on the real
earth - "in reality" - and maybe as a machine I can do that and maybe not
Mostly it's a combination of  that and a special  "honoring:" of what I have
now, enjoy it, love it, as an *attitude* -  an attitude to enhance my life
NOW> which keep me positive.
But as Eugene Leitl said in his great response to the same post I replied to,
virtual sweat would sting like the real stuff - so a VR body might be one
option - if it was  "indistinguishable" from my own body * and* unlimited
too, then I would probably opt for the VR version, maybe ... maybe not  - if
I could live forever in reality! : - )
...his post made me think a lot. Better have some GOOD artists making the
sweat...
I am still questioning these thingslike everyone else, but I certainly dont
see the body as a handicap or something I want to get rid of !!

I didn't mean this scenario as some sort of test for the human race.
It's simply a case of how much trouble humans might pose to the AI.
Humans might not present enough benefits to such an intelligence to
keep around if they are going to randomly damage equipment. Consider it
equivalent to demanding that an obnoxious houseguest either shape up 
or leave.

Could this mean that the culture of mysticism and it's illogical behavior
could mean that people who believe in such are ahead of the rest of us??
People believing in mysticism tap into many more emotions than atheists
through "religious experiences". Is that where we're headed? Is religion a
natural part of culture and intelligence except now due to our ability to
control our fate, WE ARE BECOMING the gods through transhumanism?

Thats simple, 3-D displays as psudo-windows that way everyone will have a
beach-front view or rainforest view. Whichever you prefer. Imagine an
arcology sitting in the middle of a future 'jurassic park' so that you'd be
looking down onto a prehistoric world from the sky.

Telepresence. How about those floating webblimps w/stereoscopic vision? Or
even nanotech utility fog you could control remotely, whatever.

  (What population density are we talking

Depends how large it is.

  There's too much monkey left in us. 
So what? Thats what we are. Heres another interesting question: Why do most
people see monkeys as an icky disgusting creature? Are they? or are we just
looking down on them because they're a lesser form of human?

Funny you say that. I know a guy who *does* like plumbing and airvents as a

Maglev propelled elevators? You'd have to control the acceleration rate

I myself don't really care if FTL travel is possible because we'd still have
two other possible technologies which are breaking into planch's length and
leaping to a higher dimension to cut the time in half OR wormholes. And I'm
all for teleportation via nanotechnology. The sooner the better! Commutes
suck! Imagine all the media coverage on the day they finally begin tearing
down the nation's superhighways being rapidly replaced with teleporters.
That would be incredible and I hope to live to see that day.

It's barely begun, but there's now something worth looking at:

        http://www.extropy.org

Many of the links in the Ideas section are temporary and will be replaced
with our own pages giving information, including external links. E.g. for
"cryonics" we currently link to Alcor, but this will be replaced with our
own cryonics page, which will include links to all the cryonics organizations.

I believe that an SI is more likely to arise spontaneously than by
design.
Even if the SI arises by design, I don't believe that that its initial
design
will profoundly influence its ultimate characteristics, since  it will
take
control of its own development.

There is actually a reasonable secnario that would limit an SI to one
star system
but stil make it use up all the resources in that start system. This
will occur if the SI is attempting to maximize is computational speed
and capacity until it achieves some breakthrough that causes it to no
longer have this maximization
as a goal. The payback time for using out-of-system resources is very
long, since
the mass you send out-of-system can otherwise be used to augment your
in-system resources with no speed-of-light delay. Thus, the SI must
choose between immedate use of the mass to build more local computing
capacity, or investingthe mass in a mission to another system to return
more computing capacity later. I feel that the SI may choose to keep the
mass, since at the SI's speed of computation, the return of resources
from another system is an incredibly large number of computational
cycles into the future. 

One technique that an SI may use to speed itself up is to convert itself
into
a neutron star. This puts the mass in a smaller radius, which increases
the
computing capacity by reducing signalling delays.

        I don't think we should rule *anything* out at this point in time.
I don't like the word 'impossible', I see it as more of an assumption than
anything convincing.  In other words, I'm not ruling out any possiblility of
Faster-Than-Light travel.

        Comfortably?  Maybe one billion.  Personally, I think the population
is a little too big as is, but we could probably sustain another billion
people while still maintaining comfort.  Hopefully us extropians and
transhumans will be able to convince the rest of the world to colonize other
planets before we reach the 6.5 billion (uncomfortable) range.

Chris, could you provide a list of the major undernet servers please?
Although I'm not much of an IRC user, I have been told that over here
we're connected primarily to the effnet IRC network, which is separate
from undernet.  If someone can provide a list of public undernet servers,
I'll drop in to #extropy some time.

Cheers,

Rich.

I think they do believe what they say.  But their willingness to 
believe it is coerced by their need for approval.  Most 
people feel good when they are not alone in a belief system (the

I have a huge problem with what REALLY is the truth, mainly because 
REALLY is a subjective term.

No.  It is evidence that they don`t seek your truth.  From what I`ve 
heard from many christians is that they have found, and are very 
happy with, "the" truth.

It would be less rewarding for _you_ to accept such a cosy system, 
some people need the security.  

You can`t ever escape a belief system, even if your belief is to shun 
beliefs...Aaaaahhhhh, I've spun a strange loop and can't get out.

Perhaps a comfortable population is not as desirable as an 
uncomfortable one.  All you social darwinists out there, might agree 
that an overpopulated planet would catapult natural selection into 
new survival solutions.

Organisms eat matter and make it a part of themselves.  If I
extrapolate this trend, I see a huge blob of silico/organic _living_ 
matter where once there was an earth.

What? Don't you believe the beautiful architect sketches of how nice the 
new building is going to be, and how happy and social the inhabitants 
will be? :-)

As others pointed out, good 3D windows would give everyone a perfect 
view, with no need to build an Arcology with apartments only at the 
surface (Hmm, a very long and thin wall - could separate two ecosystems 
in an aesthetic way). But in that case, you don't need to build the 
arcology in the rainforest either. The big problem with this is 
psychological: many people would feel constrained if they knew they lived 
in a big hive.

Why not integrate both? I seriously think the arcology of the future will 
be more lush and natural on the *inside* than on the outside. With 
ecotech, genetic engineering and some clever planning we might live in 
(say) vertical tree-cities (shades of the Evoks in Return of the jedi), 
around artificial trees that are both living and structural support, 
contains the plumbing, networking equipment etc. Instead of trying to 
move as far as possible away from our ancestors, we might do a synthesis 
instead.

Not to mention the pressure differentials. I really get annoyed by even 
small changes in pressure. 

The answer is of course: don't think of the elevators as elevators, see 
them as taxis or local trains. We somehow accept having to move around in 
a city several times a day, despite it taking several minutes and more.

One ideal sturcture might be a superscraper city with buildings linked by 
quick transit lines on bridges, with an extensive park level on the 
ground (and probably local ecologies higher up). Sounds a bit like 
classic sf.

Party line? It is a scientific question, not ideological. FTL is currently
regarded as extremely unlikely since it would mess up some rather likely
assumptions in physics (matter and energy can only exist as positive
energy densities, cause and effect and all that). It might be possible,
but there is no evidence for its possibility yet (although some intriguing
theoretical possibilities like wormholes, the Novikov consistency theorems
and the Alcubierre drive). 

> Here's an informal poll?  What do you all consider the comfortable
> carrying capacity of the planet?  Not the maximum.  

Depends on how you want to live. Some people might like an agrarian 
lifestyle, which would require larger areas than a highly automated city 
lifestyle. 

Personally I like to have big cities, and little between them (although 
there will no doubt be many people who would want to live there; myself, 
I like to have wast tracts of self-running nature which I don't have to 
deal with but can admire). This could lead to very high or low population 
numbers, depending on the number of cities and their size. 

Resource-wise, I think we could estimate that a few billion people could 
live sustainably with close-to-present technology, and probably several 
tens or billion with nanotechnology. But it depends on more factors than 
that.

In that case you have to be *very* fast and convincing - we are already 
close to 6 billion people, and will reach seven in a few years more. 
Somehow, I doubt building the necessary space infrastructure (which in 
the case of moving *billions* is extremely extensive) will be achieved in 
such a short span of time even if everyone saw that it was a Good Thing.

What about Nicholas Bourbaki? I assume "he" still is active and

If I was an immortal transcient, I might find mankind cumbersome and slow,
and thus unlikely to do the job well on its own. So I might help it along
with some clever devices (say by letting a submind develop cheap space
transport or a powerful nootropic) and start spreading it, while my main
self was busy with important things.

Disclaimer: This forward is _not_ meant as Alcor propaganda. Far 
from it. (Actually, I consider current bout of mutual name-calling on 
Cryonet extremely antiproductive, to say the very least). 

Nevertheless the fact of the purportedly first reversible crypreservation 
of a macroscopic organ (if indeed true) is pretty interesting, imo.

Subject: SCI. CRYONICS announcement

VISSER DEMONSTRATION & LICENSING AGREEMENT

Joint Announcement of Cryonics Institute and Alcor Life Extension Foundation

RAT HEARTS REVIVED FROM LIQUID NITROGEN--this milestone in cryobiology has
been confirmed at the Alcor facility during the week of Aug. 30-Sep. 4, 1996.

The achievement was reported last year from the University of Pretoria, South
Africa, by Michelle Olga Visser, who used a new cryoprotective agent (CPA).
She also reported submitting a paper on the experiment to CRYOBIOLOGY, with
three co-authors at her university, in December 1995.

Mrs. Visser is Head of Research, Department of Thoracic Surgery, Faculty of
Medicine, University of Pretoria. She is a perfusionist by training and
practice, working for the University hospital and also as an independent
contractor. She is a Ph.D. candidate in cryobiology, whose studies include
physiology and pharmacology. 

She has been doing research in organ cryopreservation for the last three
years, after having started the first homograft bank in Pretoria eight years
ago at her department. She set up this bank to store heart valves harvested
for re-implantation, using standard cryo procedures (DMSO), and developed an
interest in developing a method for organs.

Her original report was met with general skepticism or indifference, and
publication has apparently been delayed by requests for revisions. But
Anatole Dolinoff, president of the Cryonics Society of France, suggested that
Mrs. Visser get in touch with Robert Ettinger, and extensive discussions by
e-mail followed. CI and Alcor invited her and her husband Siegfried to come
to Arizona as our guests and demonstrate the Visser method with rat hearts.
This was finally done, and we have seen first-hand the confirmation of this
accomplishment--arguably the most important since 1948, when Jean Rostand
froze frog sperm with glycerol.

The Vissers were assisted in the Alcor building, in a lab used and lent by
CryoSearch Inc., by biochemist Hugh Hixon and by other Alcor people including
Rhonda Iacuzzo and Tanya Jones. Witnesses included Steve Bridge, Mike Perry,
Robert and Mae Ettinger, Fred and Linda Chamberlain, David Pizer, Paul
Garfield, Ralph Whelan, Brian Shock, Derek Ryan, and Mathew Sullivan. Fred
and Linda also helped with some of the chores, including videotaping.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF RESULTS: It wasn't smooth going. The equipment was
different than the Vissers were accustomed to, and some of it was not
compatible; and human error is easy with small animal organs. There were
several failures during several long days of work. But there were also two
hearts that showed weak beating and one that showed strong beating, after
rewarming from liquid nitrogen temperature. This is unequivocal proof that
the Visser technique (at least as applied to rat hearts) is far superior to
anything previously reported. 

Control hearts--immersed in liquid nitrogen in the same manner but not
perfused--showed gross damage, including cracking, and no signs of life.

Because of limitations of equipment, the hearts were kept in liquid nitrogen
for only a half minute to a minute--but the temperature probe showed core
temperature within a few degrees of that of liquid nitrogen, - 196 C or - 320
F. Once such a temperature is reached, it is generally agreed that the length
of time of storage does not matter. Mrs. Visser reports that the longest she
has kept hearts in liquid nitrogen is 45 minutes, and these were successfully
revived. Alcor personnel will be working to establish a reliable, routine
experimental protocol, and will be storing rat hearts for longer periods.
Cryonics Institute also plans to test longer term storage of various organs. 

BRAINS: For cryonics, results with brains are the most important. There are
experimental and theoretical reasons to think the Visser method will work
well with brains also. The CPA penetrates the blood-brain barrier.
Preliminary experiments at Alcor with rat brains show normal appearance to
the naked eye and under the light microscope (but we do not yet have
micrographs). 

LIMITATIONS OF THIS REPORT: Pending journal publication of their paper, the
authors do not want to publicize the identity of the CPA or other details of
the procedure, or to discuss the mechanism of cryoprotection. Patents have
been applied for, or soon will be, in South Africa and several other
countries, by Cryopreservation Technologies cc, the South African corporation
in which Mr. and Mrs. Visser are majority shareholders. 

CRYONICS LICENSING AGREEMENT: In return for help in funding their further
research, the Vissers have given CI and Alcor exclusive license to use their
present and future technology for cryonics purposes. This includes the right
to sub-license. 

PERSONAL NOTES: The Vissers formed an excellent working relationship with
Hugh Hixon--who impressed everyone with his resourcefulness in adapting
equipment--as well as with other Alcor people including Rhonda Iacuzzo and
Tanya Jones. The Vissers stayed with Mae and Bob Ettinger, and were pleasant,
considerate, and extremely interesting guests. There were many long
conversations on a variety of topics- especially between the Vissers and Mae,
since Bob was often tied up with other duties. Mr. Visser, a consulting
engineer, understands the Visser method
thoroughly and acts as lab partner; he is also the main business person in
the Vissers' company. Mrs. Visser, despite her amazing energy, drive, and
perfectionism, is also kind and understanding.


NON-CRYONICS RESEARCH: A priority of the Visser group is to pursue research
with large animal organs, in preparation for transplant experiments, leading
up to human cryogenic organ banking. There are reasons to believe there is a
very large potential market for such technology--not only including such
traditional transplant candidates as kidney, heart, liver, pancreas, corneas
etc., but also limbs or digits, glands such as thyroid, and others.

TIME HORIZONS: When Mrs. Visser has funding, she estimates 8 months to a year
to prove pig organ transplants. After that, the time required to get
permission for human clinical trials, and to run those trials, and then to
get regulatory approval, depends on the country or countries of choice and
other factors. All told, perhaps 3 to 5 years. The demand for transplants,
and the life-saving nature of the technology, might expedite matters,
compared to customary procedures.

For 100% proof of reversible cryopreservation of the human brain, we know of
no reliable way to make even a rough guess. It will take as long as it takes.
But with the Visser method we have a running start--and it seems very
possible that our cryonics patients will very soon have much better
suspensions than any previously available. 

Robert C.W. Ettinger, President, Cryonics Institute

Stephen W. Bridge, President, Alcor Life Extension Foundation

Sounds like an important step forward. It is especially powerful
memetically, since it demonstrates that macroscopic organs can be
restored, the heart is often associated with life, and that it complements
the results of others with cat brains (which exhibit EEG activity after
rewarming). This has made the case for cryonics far more credible, despite
its tentative nature.

Erm, you got this wrong. I was not talking about front-user costs. Just 
infrastructure-associated costs, which is a heavily free-market modulated 
subset of the former.

I was referring both to current infrastructure, but mostly to near-future 
infrastructure, which will be _extremely_ dear. Forbiddingly so. 
Compacting cities is basically the only way how we can afford such 
infrastructure, mature nanotech not taking into account ;)

That the need to counteract infrastructure deterioration, new 
installations set apart, imposes a major drain upon the pocket of most 
large cities is not open do doubt. Alone costs for Teutonic road 
maintenance are atrocious, and I think U.S. has much higher costs due to 
lower average population density. At a guess, multidigit Gbuck values?
Plus, moving heaps of processed iron by means of obsolescent ICU engines, 
producing traffic jams and casualties en masse. This is sure sustainable 
future technology.

Moreover, wholly different effects arise once a certain humans/volume 
density threshold is reached:

The drastically better surface/volume ratio allows higher-quality surface 
materials to be used, e.g. thin-film photovoltaics on glass. This gives 
both power and makes frequent costly repairs unnecessary. (This also 
applies to other brands of infrastructure, e.g. as glass/ceramics tubing, 
stainless steel pipes, hitech ceramics coating, steel structures, etc).

There is no weather impact on traffic, since there is no weather. And 
traffic is hidden invisibly into channels. Why do we tolerate this number 
of car accidents, many of them fatal or crippling? Why?

There is no need to heat in winter, only to get rid of excess heat, 
whatever the season.

A large cell-local fuelcell (or a natural gas ICU, or whatever) can 
produce both power and heat. You can't do heat/energy coupling because of 
large distances involved. There are none in HiveCity.

Rainwater can be cached. Due to it, sewage infrastructure's cheaper, too.

You don't need to decceleate/accelerate on every crossing, since traffic 
routing in matrix buses make this a very rare event. The same 
transportation system is utilized both for human traffic and deliveries, 
all automagically. Painless: no noise, no exhaust, no need for a human 
driver. Hang TV-shopping, but why not buying by telepresence?

Private (electro/hydrogen) airports can be put onto the upper level. 
Parks, solar cells and/or hydroponics facilities can be located there.

But the basic reason for why we need HiveCity is need for undenaturated 
landscape. Suburbia seals landscape, denaturates habitats. I want to be 
able to see fresh green after 5 min travel from any part of the city, not 
after hours of car travel, which pisses off other city inhabitants. I am 
_not_ proposing anyone to turn into human RatMoles or bees, living solely 
in windowless cubicles. Of what use are windows if all I see is a sea of 
concrete and asphalt?

However, since windows will be rare, sufficient visual stimuli should 
be provided. This can be done by inserting some ecosphere into the tiers, 
by ubiquitous beamers or augmented reality. The bugaboo of endless gray 
concrete corridors need not to be contemplated, a minumum amount of 
inventiveness provided.

The only minus I am aware of, is the need for photovoltaics panes in 
HiveCity's immediate neighbourhood. However, these provide only minimal 
shading, so that there is sufficient ambient light below.

Pipes must be present first, and this requires both pipes and 
earthworks. Pipes are paid by the meter, earthwork by volume. 
(I am assuming infrastructure channels to be present in the MallCity).
Both is not cheap. Pipes corrode, this requires tracking their state and 
earthworks, again, if access is required. Proper channel infrastructure 
can be implemented only in a HiveCity, both because of planning and costs 
attached.

Nevertheless, there is a strong push towards teleworking. Currently, 
most teleworkers need to shuttle into main office for 1-2 days a week, 
mostly for social/company spirit recalibration reasons. In mature 
VR/telepresence there is no need to be physically present, a minimal 
fakespace fidelity provided. A a decade from now, you can render a cushy 
bureau, filled with avatars, should you wish such a thing.
 
Admittedly, we are still lacking adequate displays and bandwidth channels 
for above scenario to become realistic. Assuming hypergrid optical fiber 
connectivity, HiveCities win hugely, again.

Afair I never implied that a more cost-efficient infrastructure would 
make living in cities cheaper. It was not my intention to dismiss 
anything, I was just seized by a fit of blue-skyeing. I thought that much 
was obvious.

Last posting I mistook a response by Eugene Leitl at Univ. Muenchen 
(Ludwig Maximillian) for Max More.   It was not Max More.  Should you
respond to either his original message, or my response, please be clear
about this.  Eugene and I are in disagreement about the complexity (or
lack thereof) of future hyperintelligence motivations.

This gives me the opportunity to pose a question about such motivations. 
I, for one, am not convinces that a future AI civilization (or overlordship
of a single such entity) will be inexorably driven to dismantle and convert
all available resources in the system--including Earth.  Such a process is
could just as likely be a distraction from it's purpose as in support of it. 
But usually, the motivation of <consume and grow/reproduce> is a
function of the lower mind (or no mind at all), basic but controllable,
especially for higher intellectual pursuits or complex cultural gratification.

Also, anybody out there taking DHEA-Dehydroepiandrosterone? 
Anybody old enough to consider it?

Shaun,  6.5 billion people is about eight years away.  Not much planetary
colonization can do about that.  And I doubt planetary emigration will ever
be a solution, just an escape for some.  Fortunately here in the
developed world, population growth isn't relevant.  We have none, some
places are actually lessening.  The U.S. has the highest growth rate in
the developed world because of an open immigration policy--about a
million lesser-developed types a year legally, and another half million
Mexicans illegally--add to that their first generation birth rates, and the
U.S. is growing at a comfortable rate, although that growth is mostly
happening among this nation's poorer groups.  Utah being the exception
for obvious reasons.  I don't think the U.S. is supposed to hit 400 million
before late in the next century.

Bangladesh has to worry about population growth, not Belgium.

There seeem to be two different scenarios here.  
1. The intelligence in a star system may at some point be no longer
interested in increasing computational ability.
2. The other is that discount rates may colonization not
cost-effective.

On 1. The effective net values of a star system will be composed of
the values of its many components.  Even if most of these components
suddenly no longer desire computation ability, some components surely
will.  And some components will surely value exploration and
colonization for its own sake.  Even within a group the size of this
list we have a wide variety of goals regarding our futures.

On 2. Even just looking at the goal of maximizing computation, you
need to remember that discount rates are evolutionarily endogenous.
If there are many different components with different discount rates,
the ones that come to dominate the population are the ones whose
discount rates are best tied to the feasible growth rate.  If solar
system limits are hit, so growth stops, then components who value
longer and longer time scales will come to dominate, until extra-solar
colonization efforts start to look attractive.

Joint Announcement of Cryonics Institute and
Alcor Life Extension Foundation

RAT HEARTS REVIVED FROM LIQUID
NITROGEN--this milestone in cryobiology has
been confirmed at the Alcor facility during
the week of Aug. 30-Sep. 4, 1996.

The achievement was reported last year from
the University of Pretoria, South Africa, by
Michelle Olga Visser, who used a new
cryoprotective agent (CPA). She also
reported submitting a paper on the
experiment to CRYOBIOLOGY, with three
co-authors at her university, in December
1995.

Mrs. Visser is Head of Research, Department
of Thoracic Surgery, Faculty of Medicine,
University of Pretoria. She is a
perfusionist by training and practice,
working for the University hospital and also
as an independent contractor. She is a Ph.D.
candidate in cryobiology, whose studies
include physiology and pharmacology. 

She has been doing research in organ
cryopreservation for the last three years,
after having started the first homograft
bank in Pretoria eight years ago at her
department. She set up this bank to store
heart valves harvested for re-implantation,
using standard cryo procedures (DMSO), and
developed an interest in developing a method
for organs.

Her original report was met with general
skepticism or indifference, and publication
has apparently been delayed by requests for
revisions. But Anatole Dolinoff, president
of the Cryonics Society of France, suggested
that Mrs. Visser get in touch with Robert
Ettinger, and extensive discussions by
e-mail followed. CI and Alcor invited her
and her husband Siegfried to come to Arizona
as our guests and demonstrate the Visser
method with rat hearts. This was finally
done, and we have seen first-hand the
confirmation of this
accomplishment--arguably the most important
since 1948, when Jean Rostand froze frog
sperm with glycerol.

The Vissers were assisted in the Alcor
building, in a lab used and lent by
CryoSearch Inc., by biochemist Hugh Hixon
and by other Alcor people including Rhonda
Iacuzzo and Tanya Jones. Witnesses included
Steve Bridge, Mike Perry, Robert and Mae
Ettinger, Fred and Linda Chamberlain, David
Pizer, Paul Garfield, Ralph Whelan, Brian
Shock, Derek Ryan, and Mathew Sullivan. Fred
and Linda also helped with some of the
chores, including videotaping.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF RESULTS: It wasn't
smooth going. The equipment was different
than the Vissers were accustomed to, and
some of it was not compatible; and human
error is easy with small animal organs.
There were several failures during several
long days of work. But there were also two
hearts that showed weak beating and one that
showed strong beating, after rewarming from
liquid nitrogen temperature. This is
unequivocal proof that the Visser technique
(at least as applied to rat hearts) is far
superior to anything previously reported. 

Control hearts--immersed in liquid nitrogen
in the same manner but not perfused--showed
gross damage, including cracking, and no
signs of life.

Because of limitations of equipment, the
hearts were kept in liquid nitrogen for only
a half minute to a minute--but the
temperature probe showed core temperature
within a few degrees of that of liquid
nitrogen, - 196 C or - 320 F. Once such a
temperature is reached, it is generally
agreed that the length of time of storage
does not matter. Mrs. Visser reports that
the longest she has kept hearts in liquid
nitrogen is 45 minutes, and these were
successfully revived. Alcor personnel will
be working to establish a reliable, routine
experimental protocol, and will be storing
rat hearts for longer periods. Cryonics
Institute also plans to test longer term
storage of various organs. 

BRAINS: For cryonics, results with brains
are the most important. There are
experimental and theoretical reasons to
think the Visser method will work well with
brains also. The CPA penetrates the
blood-brain barrier. Preliminary experiments
at Alcor with rat brains show normal
appearance to the naked eye and under the
light microscope (but we do not yet have
micrographs). 

LIMITATIONS OF THIS REPORT: Pending journal
publication of their paper, the authors do
not want to publicize the identity of the
CPA or other details of the procedure, or to
discuss the mechanism of cryoprotection.
Patents have been applied for, or soon will
be, in South Africa and several other
countries, by Cryopreservation Technologies
cc, the South African corporation in which
Mr. and Mrs. Visser are majority
shareholders. 

CRYONICS LICENSING AGREEMENT: In return for
help in funding their further research, the
Vissers have given CI and Alcor exclusive
license to use their present and future
technology for cryonics purposes. This
includes the right to sub-license. 

PERSONAL NOTES: The Vissers formed an
excellent working relationship with Hugh
Hixon--who impressed everyone with his
resourcefulness in adapting equipment--as
well as with other Alcor people including
Rhonda Iacuzzo and Tanya Jones. The Vissers
stayed with Mae and Bob Ettinger, and were
pleasant, considerate, and extremely
interesting guests. There were many long
conversations on a variety of topics-
especially between the Vissers and Mae,
since Bob was often tied up with other
duties. Mr. Visser, a consulting engineer,
understands the Visser method thoroughly and
acts as lab partner; he is also the main
business person in the Vissers' company.
Mrs. Visser, despite her amazing energy,
drive, and perfectionism, is also kind and
understanding.


NON-CRYONICS RESEARCH: A priority of the
Visser group is to pursue research with
large animal organs, in preparation for
transplant experiments, leading up to human
cryogenic organ banking. There are reasons
to believe there is a very large potential
market for such technology--not only
including such traditional transplant
candidates as kidney, heart, liver,
pancreas, corneas etc., but also limbs or
digits, glands such as thyroid, and others.

TIME HORIZONS: When Mrs. Visser has funding,
she estimates 8 months to a year to prove
pig organ transplants. After that, the time
required to get permission for human
clinical trials, and to run those trials,
and then to get regulatory approval, depends
on the country or countries of choice and
other factors. All told, perhaps 3 to 5
years. The demand for transplants, and the
life-saving nature of the technology, might
expedite matters, compared to customary
procedures.

For 100% proof of reversible
cryopreservation of the human brain, we know
of no reliable way to make even a rough
guess. It will take as long as it takes. But
with the Visser method we have a running
start--and it seems very possible that our
cryonics patients will very soon have much
better suspensions than any previously
available. 

Robert C.W. Ettinger, President, Cryonics
Institute

I agree. Though FTL travel  is disallowed in Relativity, it is possible that
we might eventually find that Relativity applies only in certain situations;
Relativity could take on a role similar to that of Newtonian mechanics today.

Ah, that tired old left-right dimension again. Let's get away from this
one-dimensional view of political views. If you haven't seen the Nolan
Chart, which makes progress by mapping views into two dimensions, I
recommend taking a look. I believe there's a link to it somewhere on Eric
Watt Forste's Extropians web site in one of the sections dealing with politics.

Left vs. right is quite unhelpful, and those of us who are libertarian, or
otherwise strongly and consistently individualist, do ourselves a disservice
trying to place ourselves on that axis. "Left" used to mean the
revolutionaries who sat on the left of the assembly during the time of the
French Revolution. The "right" were the monarchists. Individualists have a
quite different set of values, although we at least have in common with the
old left the desire to change the existing order. However, most of us would
not choose to use the slogan "liberty, equality, fraternity" since this has
meant, in practice, freedom from choice, compulsory and fake equality, and
forced fraternity.

Since then, the terms "left" and "right" have mutated in meaning so much
that they are worthless. When I was a libertarian student activist in
England, "right" could mean (a) an old Tory conservative, protective of the
existing order, not wanting to change much at all; (b) a fascist; (c) a
mildly progressive conservative who wanted to slightly roll back government
only in the social sphere; (c) a libertarian who wanted to vastly increase
liberty in both economic and social spheres. 

Sometime libertarians got described as the "new right". (Due to one of my
teenage essays for the Libertarian Alliance, a newspaper once described me a
"the precocious guru of the New Right" -- a title that still makes me
chuckle. They also called me a "morally deformed exhibitionist". Hmmm, maybe
Nick Nicholas was a newspaper writer in England in those days....) But "New
Right" was also used to refer to the very opposite of libertarian -- those
who wanted the government to control all aspects of individuals' lives for
the sake of the nation.

There are many Extropian party lines: at The Extropy is Eight party at
Freeland last month, for instance, there were lines to shower before getting
in the hot tub, lines to use the bathroom, etc.

What if we were to assimilate all the resources of planet earth and make a
molecular map of the Earth inside a virtual world so that you could let the
ecology run free without all the people but the real material Earth would
have long since been dismantled and converted to resources. We could do this
to every planet we came along past. Much like VGR in Star Trek: The Motion
Picture where inside it contained entire star systems recreated inside it.
This way we would lose nothing while still gaining resources.

        I apologize if my response was a little misleading.  *Physically*
another billion (indeed another three) would be comfortable, but when you
take into consideration the strong belief systems of the predominant portion
of that billion AND the potential for more children, that is uncomfortable
to me.  Look at the current skirmishing in the middle-East!

        The fact that North America will reach the ZPG level within a
relatively short time is slightly encouraging...but not as encouraging than
if we had lots more room to roam.  As for planet emigration being a
solution, I think it would be.  Mainly because of the potential it creates;
think: if we can make it to one planet, what prevents us from making it to
another?  And given the knowledge that scientific progress is constantly
being made (in some way or another), I'm optimistic about inhabiting planets
before Earth reaches the *physically* uncomfortable level.

        Au contraire, mon bien amis.  The world's resources are limited.
More people *anywhere* means quicker diminishing of oxygen, wood, water,

Referring to the typical Christian, I said,

"Their blatant dogmatism is evidence that they don't seek the truth,"

Stephen de Vries replied,

"No.  It is evidence that they don`t seek your truth.  From what I`ve heard 
from many christians is that they have found, and are very happy with, "the" 
truth."

	I suppose I should clarify what I mean by "the truth" and what I mean by 
"seeking the truth."  "The truth" is the way things actually are.  "My truth" 
is the way things actually are for me.  "Your truth" is the way things 
actually are, for you.  "Seeking the truth" is to actively search for a more 
accurate perception and understanding of how things actually are, constantly 
refining one's own observational and rational abilities, so that the way 
things actually are can be perceived and understoond with greater clarity.
	Thus, I maintain that most people, including Christians, do not seek the 
truth, whether that be my truth or their own truths.  Yes, they may have found 
a way of thinking and living that makes them happy, and they may call that 
"the truth", but I think it would more accurately be called "a good way of 
thinking and living", and not "the truth".
	I repeat, to "seek the truth" is to be actively engaged in increasing one's 
own observational abilities (which include increasing sensory acuity and 
personal bandwidth), and increasing one's reasoning abilities.  It's about 
developing an increasingly accurate understanding of the way things are.  
	Yes, we each have our own viewpoint, our own set of data to analyze, and 
thus, each individual would seek a different truth (if they seek at all).  
However, I think it is valid to say that someone is not "seeking the truth" if 
they are not actively working on clarifying their perception and understanding 
of the data and thinking that is their personal world.  I also think that most 
people, including Christians, are NOT actively engaged in this process of 
"seeking the truth."
	By saying, "most people do not seek the truth," I am not necessarily implying 
that these people are bad people or anything like that.  I intend it to have 
the same sort of connotation as saying, "most people are not auto mechanics."  
I'm simply stating a fact about what sort of activities they don't engage in.  
Someone who does not really work on automobiles but likes to think of 
theirself as an auto mechanic may be offended by being told that they are not 
really an auto mechanic, and likewise, people who aren't really engaged in 
improving the quality of their perception and understanding of their world but 
like to think of themselves as truth-seekers may be offended by being told 
that they really aren't seekers of the truth.  But their offense does not 
change the nature of their activities.

In your (excellent) terms, my "plasuible scenario" is actually
a little different: the  discount rate has a very large discontinuity at
the point when all in-system resources are exhausted being used
"optimally"
for computing. At this point the system-wide SI is likely to use its
computational
capacity to exhaustively analyze its next move. What if the only logical
conclusion A system-wide SI can reach it that out-system resoureces are
uneconomical?

Both of your arguments make the same funcamental assuption that
there is more than one SI in a star system. This is also a fundamental
assmption in the "Great Filter" paper. My "plausible scenario" makes
the opposite assumption, that a single SI takes over the star system.

In regard to the "great filter", the argument (mangled and
grossly oversimplified by me) is :

      We haven't heard from them, therefore they aren't out there.
      If they were out there then (because there are a lot of them),
      we would have heard from at least some of them.

The argument may have a flaw: There may not be a lot of diverse SIs
in the universe. There may be only one per system, and they may all
have reached the same super-logical conclusion that star travel is
uneconomical in terms of the resources that SIs use. 

BTW, I feel that the scenario is plausible. That doesn't mean that I
think
it's the only plausible scenario, and it doesn't mean that I like it.

Remember! you can use compression! You could compress the Earth quite easily
because there is so much redundant data and yes, you could possibly use
quantum switches or molecular circuits and memory. Imagine how many
terabytes that would require?

>You can't simulate reality in greater detail than reality.
So? All we need is for the necessary laws of physics to be present and
anything beyond that is unnecessary. Like I'm sure dark matter has a direct
effect on our planet other than gravity pull.(sarcasm)

Quantum computers are alluring but nobody has built one yet and until very  
recently the only useful program known to be able to run on these machines 
was one to factor large numbers for code breaking. Unfortunately there are 
problems, to factor a 100 digit number the machine would need to perform 
millions of quantum logical operations without being effected by the outside
environment, even with the newly discovered quantum error correcting codes 
that would not be easy to do, not for that many operations. In the August 23 
1996  Science is a fascinating research article by Seth Lloyd called 
"Universal  Quantum Simulators". Lloyd has found a way for quantum computers 
to do something far, FAR, more useful than factoring numbers, and is much 
easier for the machines to do too.
                
In quantum mechanics it's often possible in theory to predict what something  
will do but not in practice because of computational complexity, that's why 
Chemists must still perform experiments. To simulate the behavior of N 
electrons, in a conventional computer you would need memory space and 
computation time proportional to 2^2N. Just to figure out what's going on with 
40 electrons, like those found in a medium sized  atom, you would need to 
perform 10^24 operations. It's no wonder that Chemists keep their test tubes.
 
Lloyd found a way to perform the same simulation using just N quantum bits 
(qubits) and the number of operations the quantum machine  must do is  
proportional to N, not 2^2N as on a conventional computer. In addition, the 
time required to do the simulation over time t is proportional to t, in other 
words it can do it in real time, like a Analog computer. A very important
feature of Lloyd's algorithm is that it doesn't demand that the Quantum 
computer be a perfect machine that is totally isolated from the environment, 
it easily deals with errors. Incredibly, noise from the environment and 
decoherence can be useful to the computer, it can actually help it simulate 
noise and decoherence in the system it's simulating.
 
This may help put a stop to all the "End Of Science" books we've been seeing 
lately. People were saying that it was a waste of time to try to find a 
quantum theory of gravity because there would be no way to test it. It would  
be a HUGE calculation, but a thousand qubit quantum computer could do it.  
Lloyd says we could make a Quantum Computer today with a few tens of qubits
and it would "require only minor modifications of current technology". 
I'd say that's a pretty good start. He also says "The wide variety of atomic, 
molecular, and semiconductor quantum devices available suggests that quantum 
simulation may soon be a reality".
 
In a separate development, Lov K Grover of ATT recently found a way for a  
Quantum Computer to find a piece of information in a random list with N items 
in just the square root of N steps, not 1/2 N steps, which is the  average if 
you do this on a conventional computer.

computer be a perfect machine that is totally isolated from the environment, 
it easily deals with errors. Incredibly, noise from the environment and 
decoherence can be useful to the computer, it can actually help it simulate 
noise and decoherence in the system it's simulating.
 
This may help put a stop to all the "End Of Science" books we've been seeing 
lately. People were saying that it was a waste of time to try to find a 
quantum theory of gravity because there would be no way to test it. It would  
be a HUGE calculation, but a thousand qubit quantum computer could do it.  
Lloyd says we could make a Quantum Computer today with a few tens of qubits
and it would "require only minor modifications of current technology". 
I'd say that's a pretty good start. He also says "The wide variety of atomic, 
molecular, and semiconductor quantum devices available suggests that quantum 
simulation may soon be a reality".
 
In a separate development, Lov K Grover of ATT recently found a way for a  
Quantum Computer to find a piece of information in a random list with N items 
in just the square root of N steps, not 1/2 N steps, which is the  average if 
you do this on a conventional computer.

No, but I don't think there is much point in doing molecular simulations
of every voxel of the Earth's core. Most interesting stuff is just in the
outermost 10 kilometers or so, the rest can probably be simplified very
much.

Depends on your sensitivity. Myself, I notice the pressure difference 
between my flat on the 14th floor and the ground level. One of my first 
augmentations will definitely be to enlarge the channel between mouth and 
ear. :-)

Probably the simplest solution, yes. 

Building this kind of super/arcology-city is probably not that hard 
technically speaking (and with some advanced materials we can have real 
fun - some of you might have read Forrest Bishop's and mine visions on 
the transhumanist list a while back about diamondoid artificial islands 
with mountain cities and peaks intended to link to beanstalks). The 
problem is more economical (building new is expensive), social (make 
people want to live there) and logistic (how do you administrate it? Most 
of us would like to have self-organizing cities. Maybe each superbuilding 
could be its own "minicity" with its own commmunity and views).

Personally I often use three dimensions:

A left-right scale for individualism vs. collectivism,
A forward-backward scale for change vs. conservatism,
An up-down scale for movement towards the future (transhumanism) or towards 
the past (i.e back to nature luddism)

Extropianism is for example right-forward-up in this diagram.

... which in this diagram is the general direction of transhumanism at large.

Of course, this assumes non-homogenous systems, but I think we can safely
assume it. Communication lags will make a distributed mind very slow unless
its component parts have much autonomy. Most likely we will get a situation
to a human brain: a possible system metamind, rather slow but setting the
global goals, consisting of many smaller minds (which could be Jupiter
brains) which in turn consists of smaller and smaller minds. 

It might not be certain that if the metamind decides it has grown enough 
the subminds will agree (even if we consciously understand that we have 
eaten enough our hypothalamic nuclei doesn't necessarily agree). But 
spreading to another system would be more equivalent to siring a child; 
the delays would make it a very separate mind. One possibility is of 
course a galaxy of system minds joined into a super-slow metamind, but 
this would take a very long time to realize.

I don't see why subminds wouldn't set out on their own to grow into 
system minds.

I don't think I am viewing your diagram correctly, in that correct Extropian

I have noted something interesting in this thread, that we seem to assume
that SI appears out of nowwhere in a vacuum. The archetypal scenario is the
nanoworkstation at MIT that during the night transcends and takes of the
world. 

In reality, it is very unlikey that we will get SI before merely HI and 
HI before subhuman intelligence. When the techniques for creating better 
and better minds appear, they will lead to a succession of better and 
better minds. This will also lead to a better and better understanding of 
the problems and risks of intelligence engineering; unless the growth is 
very fast and uncontrolled we will know about some of the dangers and 
possibilities. 

If we create SI, we will most likely have plenty of HI and >HI, we will 
know what to expect. It should be noted that even SIs have limitations, 
and they won't be a single giant among lilliputs - there will be many 
human-sized beings to deal with, and armies of dog-sized beings, and 
trillions of lilliputs...

Interesting point. Do you like naturalist sweat, or the more expensive

This idea reminds me of a roleplaying game I ran some years ago. The main
character was an alcoholic programmer that had been involuntarily uploaded,
and worked relentlessly to create the perfect virtual whiskey from
chromatographic data, neural information and hydrodynamic simulations.  The
main corporate AI was constantly nagging him for spending the computing

Steric means the space filling properties of a molecule. If all molecules had 
an exact shape and were perfectly rigid, things would be pretty 
straightforward, but of course they are not, a Nanotechnology engineer would 
ignore this at his peril. It's not always a disadvantage however, just as in 
our Macro world, if something doesn't quite fit you can often give it a good 
whack and make it fit. Chemists also have a term called "Steric Hindrance", 
it refers to the slowing of a chemical reaction because some part of a 
molecule mechanically gets in the way. This is very important in large 
biological molecules and depending on the circumstances it can be a help or a 
hindrance to the Nanotechnology engineer, but either way he must have a 
understanding of it. There is a lot more about it in Nanosystems.

Whether something is "economical" or not is relative to the
preferences of the decision-maker.  And the preferences of a single
person like ourselves can effectively be a weighted average of many
different preferences, as if we were composed of parts with many
different preferences.

So to make your scenario plausible, you need a plausible process which
creates this massive convergence to a preference with almost no weight
on long-time-scale returns.  One way to get convergence of preferences
is via evolutionary selection, but that process seems to select

Guesses, right. Whether they were educated, dunno. Moravec seems to live 
in an alternative reality. He keeps seeing linear log plots for computer 
performance where I see none. We've had them for some time past, yes, but 
now we've hit a saturation zone, for years. We can go beyond it, if we 
assume a packaging revolution imminent, but that would mean another 
saturation zone barrier to spring up just a few years later.

This has sure nothing to do with wet neuroscience, but I think he's 
notoriously overoptimistic, possibly indiscriminately so in most areas. 
(Btw Moravec, both he & Tom Ray will speak at Medientagen in Munich on AL 
things. I will sum up to the list, should something novel crop up
there).

> storage   capacity of the human brain. As for it's information processing 

I have no idea, what a human brain can store. I can estimate how much 
storage _under certain optimistic assumptions_ a fairly accurate 
representation of the human brain will need. The amount of storage 
estimated, clearly rules out any 2d semiconductor implementations. Too 
many of these darned bits :(

This is exactly my own argument: we don't have it even now. Now I did 
not model this, and my maths is notoriously weak. But I think saturation 
makes itself felt especially bitterly if already setting in in the early 
stage of the exponential function. The linear log plot premise ignores 
several transition points, where novel technologies have to be invented & 
introduced into the market. 

Alas, one cannot predict when a technological discontinuity will have 
appeared. And to the human eqivalent we'll have several of them. 
Packaging revolution, generic paradigm switch to maspar systems, 
radically new neural accelerator chip architecture, and finally advent of 
molecular circuitry. I dunno, this sequence defines a pretty rigorous 
filter.

We'll sure make it there somewhen, but trying to estimate how long it 
will take us is somewhat pointless, using today's knowledge.

Let's see: a neuron has 10k synapses, roughly. Let's say each 
neuron's body has a dynamics of 16 bit, and a 32 bit ID (these numbers 
are quite arbitrary, and are not felt in the estimation in relation to 
the contribution of the synapses).

Each synapse has 8 bit dynamics, roughly. Let's say it connects to a 
neuron with a 32 bit ID, and 8 bits neuron class ID. (That can be seen 
either as too low, as allowing for only 4 Gneurons to be addressed, or to 
high, as it ignores hypergridish connectivity, which is mostly local, 
allowing for relative addressing). Let's add 8 bit for signal delay, even 
if we might not need it. Let's add 8 bits for synapse class ID, which 
might seem a bit high. That gives us 32+8+8+8=56 bits/synapse, let's 
round that up to 60 bits/synapse. Having 10k of them, this means 60 
kBits/neuron, not 1 MBit (1000 kBits) I claimed. An apology is due, the 1 
MBit estimate was garbage.

However, my brain faddled: I meant not MBits, but MTransistors (really, 
this is not just a lame excuse).

A DRAM cell needs 1 Transistor + 1 capacitor, an SRAM cell 4 to 6 times 
that much. DRAM cells are too slow, moreover the neural chip's 
architecture (it would lead too far exploring it here en detail) needs a 
large amount of few-bit parallel comparators, so we'd rather take the 6x 
estimate, which more than conservative. So this means 360 kTransistors/neuron. 
Moreover, one needs address decoder circuitry, an adder tree, diverse 
lookup tables or hardwired functions defined in random logic, different 
for different neuron types, a crossbar or a perfect shuffle router to send 
out signal messages to neighbour dies containing other 
neurons & receive inputs, etc. These are sure shared resources, but one 
cannot assume a huge die, since low yield would render it unsuitable for 
wafer-scale integration (WSI), so the resources may well require 0.5-1 
MTransistor/neuron, which is not very little. TI's new ASICS are supposed 
to have 125 MTransistor complexity, at surely abysmal yield (the dies are 
huge).

Whether 8 or 10, it is an arbitrary number. The dynamics certainly larger 
than 1 bit, though. Moreover, there are different synapse types.

Yeah, but I was not talking about memory storage, just computation. 
(Actually, the both are indistinguishable: are both patterns of firing 
activity. The distinction between storage & computation does not make 
sense from computational physics perspective (demand for maximal 
locality)). It's an artefact of early days of yore, erm, core. Ferrite 
core was dumb, CPU smart. Now's smart switches everywhere, no need to 
make a difference anymore.

The Hamiltonian is encoded by the physical synapse machinery. A 
postsynaptic neuron is thought to feel a neurotransmitter release, as a 
spike triggers neurotransmitter vesicle (packet) release into the 
synaptic cleft, the neurotransmitter diffusing & docking into diverse 
channels, etc. etc.

If the synapse's not there, the Hamiltonian is different, so we wind up 
in slightly different region of the phase space, the shorthand for state 
of current self. Failure of synapses, as well as cell death is a common 
event, so the Darwinian evolution has designed this function the 
Hamiltonian encodes is likely to quench such tiny deviations, to be robust. 
But not infinitely so. The hypervoxels in the persona space are defined by 
this Hamiltonian. Delete synapses, make the Hamiltonian fuzzy, and you'll 
fail to distinguish between two persons. It might be a pure ego thing, 
but I'd rather remain me, not someone else. (At first, at least).

100 k are mostly related to convergent, not divergent activities, afair.
Btw, even time-sliced silicon has trouble achieving high connectivities. 
The most natural approach would seem to favor bus width/synapse 
connectivities, which are a few 100 even on die-local kBit broad buses.

Yeah, but since the kind of coding used is unknown I'd like to assume the 
worst case. Spiked systems seem to perform better to smooth ones, btw. 
The sampling theorem would require about twice the signal bandwidth. 
Since this is hardware, I have to provide the worst case spiking 
bandwidth for each channel.

No, this is referring to data locality in simulation. Access 
latency, and such. Chemical broadcast stuff (neuromodulation) is trivial 
to simulate, agreed.

Yes, but diamondoid rods move slower. As do electric signals. And you 
have to multiplex the raw bandwidth, which is admittedly very high. But 
you can lose 3 (and more) degrees of magnitude by multiplexing.

Yes, they are small. Yet their connectivity is is much smaller, and hence 
they have to send several packets over the same local bus to reach nodes 
which they have no direct connection to in a (possibly longish) sequence 
of hops. Each link can send only one packet at a time, albeit fast.

What's this, again? Optimization? Assuming, one cannot collapse 
functionality to any noticeable degree, without simulating all the 
connectivity? That a minimal threshold computation has to be done (no 
free lunch), and that threshold to be pretty high?

Notice "groundbreaking demonstration". The same applies to quantum

It's to be hoped, the effect to be sufficiently big to be utilizable in

Yes, but what does it offer, and which costs? Which advances does it have

Your other post on QC has been very illuminating. Do you think these

unrealistically high demands on fabrication precision (structure 
geometry, alignment, etc?).

Yes, but pay attention: "cellular structures", not cells. (An E. coli is 
roughly 1x1x10 um sized, some bacteria are much smaller (I forgot the 
actual numbers, but it may be as low as 0.1x0.1x1 um)). A lipid bilayer 
is a structure. An enzyme is a structure. A ribosome is a structure. The 
C-C bond length is about the same, whether in protein or diamond. Look at 
the average virus on a workstation screen, what is the zoom factor until 
you can discern individual atoms? Not very high. I'm claiming you can't 
build a CAM cell in a cube smaller than 0.1 um (100 nm) edge by means of 
weak nanotech (molecular circuitry embedded in protein matrix). I think you 
can do better with Drexlerian nanotech by one order of magnitude max, 
that would mean 10 nm, that's less than 100 atoms/edge. Not so very much, 
I am afraid.

Yes, but how many operations/s can you gain from these atoms? How many 
bits can be stored in this volume? One bit? (probably much less). But 
storing alone is pointless, the distinction between storing and 
processing must fall, computational physics demands it. How big are your 
(smart) bits, then? Much larger, I fear.

What is physics, and what is technology is virtually the same. The 
distinctions are fuzzy at best, nowadays. A lot of constraints, all of them 
"engineering", applied in a sequence can make the gadget unviable. 
Operability window, and such. Now is this physics, or is this engineering? 
Who cares, as long as original demand -- for the functional gadget -- is 
not met.

I think my perspective is the engineer's perspective, not a pure 
scientist's.

Chemical reactions are ruled by QM, right? Mechanosynthesis is a chemical 
reaction, right? Should mechanosynthesis be the bottleneck, ruling out 
autoreplication, the gadget is inviable, right? Now is this engineering 
or science?

You want to deploy/abstract carbon atoms from above. What your tip sees, 
is a projection of the zigzagged sheet into the plane. Now I want to deploy 
a perfect diamondoid lattice. First you abstract your hydrogen, then 
_another_ tip (is this compatible with the 1*10^6 atoms/s estimate?) must 
deploy your reactive moiety before surface-absorbed species (which are 
highly mobile) bang into your radical spot, possibly quenching it.

How much precision do I need? 100 pm? Sorry, this doesn't correlate  with 
my chemical intuition.

If I want to do computation with diamondoid rods, they are pretty rigid 
on small scale. I can't push with very long, thin rods, however, I have 
to pull'em. This is one of the reasons why you can't have the gigantic 
connectivity you need for mind uploading & have to emulate it, thus 
losing the speed advantage.

According to Drexler's computation, the structure itself can exist, and 
one _can_ do computation with diamondoid systems. The iffy thing is 
mechanosynthesis, where excited states exist transiently.

But what is your skill of engineering? Why can't organic synthesis 
synthesize anything complex? Because it can't do mechanosynthesis. Why is 
biochemistry much more powerful? Basically, because it utilizes highly 
constrained systems at synthesis, which are created automagically as the 
protein folds. So whether you can create a complex structure, depends on 
your skill at mechanosyntheis. So this is a circulus vitiosus.

There _is_ a bootstrap problem, and it is not trivial. (Personally, I 
think it is surmountable, using the complementary skills of SPM, 
biochemistry & organic syntesis).

The particular structure is a stiff diamondoid tip system, driven by a 
diamondoid rod logic computer. So far, no trouble. This structure 
deposits diamondoid solids of any geometry allowed by nanolitho 
constraints. Mechanosynthesis has not been shown to work. This is a 
problem. The defect threshold in the clone structure must not have _any_ 
negative impact on positioning tip accuracy. Orelse the autoamplification 
sequence will be pitifully short, resulting in a handfull of viable 
nanoagents. Nanotechnology which can't autoreplicate is worthless. That is 
a problem.

One must be careful with words. Engineering denotes a problem class which 
is surmountable, enough work invested provided. Physics defines a class 
of structures/processes which are viable. However, you can't always say 
whether a structure/process is viable a priori. The only 'proof' would be 
the first instance of such structure, or, more weakly, lots of rock-solid 
computer runs and SPM experimental data. We don't have the former, nor 
the latter. Drexler's case is speculative engineering, augmented with 
some circumstantial evidence, not just mere engineering.

You can lick engineering.
You can't lick physics.

There is a difference.

Nor me, but without adequate R&D funds almost no relevant research will 
be done. Marketing is social engineering. I thought you liked engineering?

Simulating or implementing it in hardware are two different things. The 
neuronal connectivity can fluctuate, because the structure which computes 
has also automanipulative capabilities. A diamond rod has no such 
capabilities, it needs anabolics/catabolics by an external unit which is 
capable of mechanosynthesis. Such a unit is _very_ big, and cannot have 
access to that rod before disassembling all the other structures before it, 
recording the state, changing the circuitry, then rebuilding everything 
from memory, including state. 

(John, nanoagents are supposed to manipulate atoms, not bits. At least 
that's what they are designed to do. This is also the reason why Utility 
Fog is suboptimal as a computational medium).

I dunno, hardly an economical solution. So rather give me hardware 
of limited connectivity, which can simulate arbitrarily high 
connectivities by multiplexing existing local bandwidth. This means 
losing efficiency, resulting in much slower designs, but currently I do 
not see how this problem can be solved in any different way.

Yes, but try to rewire nodes aligned on a noisy grid with 10 k wires 
each. See the nightmare of tangled wire, as many 10k cones overlap. This 
is a jungle of sterical hindrance. You have either construct the wires 
from within, like the brain does, or from the outside, which both bloats 
the machinery drastically, making it even bigger than its biological 
counterpart.

I'd rather go for e.g. cubic primitive lattice of _very_ small, very 
brainded computers which can only talk to its neighbours. This is the CA 
paradigm, and it can emulate about anything (it's equivalent to Turing), 
unlimited connectivity included.

Of course there is a price: physical signalling can be very fast, 
probably many km/s. The entire circuit is just a few mm sized, so that's 
a lot.

However, due to multiplexing, you lose some orders of magnitude. So alas, 
the uploader is ulikely to run at 10^9 realtime speed.

The machine needs to build structures from the outside, not from within.

This is a possibly viable alternative. It requres strong Drexlerian 
nanotechnology, however, while the simple molecular circuitry (weak 
nanotech) cannot do that, relying on autoassembly of protein crystal 
growth.

Since I tend to be conservative, I always choose the simpler route. 

Autoassembling molecular circuitry is almost certainly viable, but is so 
strong nanotech?

I was referring to emulation, not hardwired implementation. Everbody 
knows a simulation is always much slower than simulation, unless clever 
algorithms can be utilized. If you can't substitute what neural circuitry
does with less demanding algorithmics (what I suspect) it's emulation 
time, alas. Wish it was different.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

I've read about past fears that building increasingly powerful particle
accelerators have the potential to create strange matter which is a more
stable form of matter that would instantly convert all matter around it into
this new form. Is there any potential of this occurring? If so should we
build particle accelerators on asteroids instead of Earth? Also what is the
potential that this could be used in the future as a type of planetary
warfare where a chunk of strange matter could be shot into the atmosphere of
another planet and convert all the matter on that planet to strange matter
therefore turning the entire planet into a mass of absolute physical entropy
since all the elemental properties would differ. Also what would a dark
matter life form be like and would it be possible to make things out of dark
matter?

Ruling things out doesn't come into it:  science doesn't work that way.
The current theories of science rule out FTL travel, but that's all, only
the theories do so --- we don't have any idea what reality herself allows
or doesn't allow.  Tomorrow we may have another theory, and when we test
its hypotheses, reality may choose not to disagree with them.  Only time
will tell, and the lesson of history is most definitely that the word
"impossible" should be used with extreme caution and lots of disclaimers.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I hadn't planed on writing on this subject so soon after my last post, but it 
seems that lately I can't walk to my mailbox without finding another important 
article about Quantum Computers. I keep thinking about Nuclear Physics in the 
late 1930's.        

Most people thought that error correcting codes for Quantum Information was 
impossible, and this would be very bad news for Quantum Computers because 
these machines will certainly make errors, no doubt about it. It turns out 
however that most people were wrong, late last year Peter Shor of ATT found a 
quantum error correcting code. The trouble was, although Shor's idea worked 
well for storing and transmitting quantum information without error, it did 
not work for the actual calculation, many thought that surely was impossible. 
It turns out they were wrong about that too.

In the August 30 1996 issue of Science is an article by J. I. Cira,  
T. Pellizzari, and P. Zoller entitled "Enforcing Coherent Evolution In  
Dissipative Quantum Dynamics". They propose a Quantum error correcting scheme 
with modest computational overhead that would dramatically increase the 
number of quantum logic gates the machine could have before errors made it 
unreliable. If p is probability that a single gate will fail, then without 
error correction, a Quantum Computer can only have 1/p gates as a practical 
matter. With this new quantum error correcting code it can have 4/p^2 gates 
before errors overwhelm it. For example, if the probability that one gate 
will fail is .09 then if you have no error correction your Quantum Computer
better not have more that 11 logic gates, with this new error correcting idea 
it could have 494 logic gates without making more errors than the 11 did. 
 
Apparently the appeal of making a calculation on 2^n numbers at the same time  
with a machine that only has n qbits is too strong for the military to ignore.  
In the same issue of Science is an article about the defense department  
making a 5 million dollar grant to start an institute for Quantum Information  
and Computing (QUIC).  It's charter has 5 aims.

1) Improve quantum algorithms.
2) Improve quantum logic gates. 
3) Improve the architecture of Quantum Computers. 
4) Improve quantum error correcting codes.
5) Study the general theory behind quantum computation.

I have not seen Nolan's chart. I will be looking it up.  In the mean time: I
wonder how it compares to Tuccille's?  

See the chart in Tuccille's book _It Usually Begins with Any Rand_  page 38. 

My interpretation follows.

The chart has a compass face or clock-like face:  

>From 10 o'clock to 2 is "Welfarism and the Mixed Economy": 11 o'clock is
Moderate liberalism, 12 is Center, 1 is Moderate conservatism.  
((This is the part I interpret as Left (Democrat) and Right (Republican)- my
thoughts only)) In Tuccille's book this is only two eighths of the full
spectrum.  

>From 8 o'clock to 4 is the area of Libertarianism: At 7 o'clock is
"Spontaneous Socialism" (Little on no governmental control over the
individual).  Moving away from this area,  from 7 to 6 o'clock is the
spectrum is called "Collectivist Anarchy".   At 6 moving to 5 and finally 4
o'clock, is "Individualist Anarchy and Laissez-Faire Capitalism" (also with
little of no governmental control over he individual).

At 9 o'clock is "Communism" (total governmental ownership). This area starts
from 9 and moves (away from Communism) up to 10 o'clock labeled "Liberal
Left" and down the clock, 8 o'clock, to "Extreme Left".  

Filling in the final part of the clock face. . . 

At 3 is "Fascism" (total government control of personal property).  You can
own property but you can't do what you want with it. (So, you _really_don't_
own property).  This area starts at 3 and goes up the clock to 2
(Conservative right) and down to 4 (Extreme right).
 
Now I understand why some see me as being: "So Left, I'm Right.  Communism at
9 and Fascism at 3. . .   I am at 6 o'cock=Libertarian, not 12=Centrist.
  :-)

I don't think I have to be labeled as being Extropian and therefore
Libertarian.  I am Libertarian but this is my view only. Other Extropians are
not required to think like me.  I see Extropianism as a logical integration
with  Libertarianism for my personal philosophy.  

The state sponsors capital punishment and imposes it on the individual.  I am
against it.  I don't think they can get the law right for such a "final
solution".   In my opinion the term "Capital Punishment" should be changed
to: "The-ugly-poor-male's penalty for murder" and penalty for having an
unlucky/bad attorney.

As an Extropian, the idea of ending life, even for the "most deserving", is
disadvantageous for me.  Innocent people have been convicted and killed.
 With this law still active, it is a threat for me and my Extropian
expectations.  




Dynamically Optimistic,

Charles, we won't be able to give much in the way of answers to that 
question until the *Cryobiology* article is published.  The Vissers 
themselves may have something they can say which would not violate their 
agreement with the journal; however, we (Alcor and CI) cannot discuss the 
technology in any kind of detail here yet.  

One major difference I CAN report is that these were entire working 
hearts, surgically removed from the rats, perfused so they continued to 
beat on their own, then frozen.  The thawed and reperfused hearts (not 
cut-up pieces) exhibited seemingly normal heartbeat (coordinated) in all 
chambers.  It looked to me like a good rat cardiac surgeon could have then 
transplanted the heart back into a rat.  That sounds different to me.

Often, measurement of atom sizes are compared to measuring a grapefruit 
with a pair of calipers: the size determined depends on pressure applied.
Repulsion component gets exponentially up with increased squeeze, though, 
so the grapefruit kernel turns (almost) infinitely incompressible (at least 
for room temperature conditions, at several MK fusion can occur) very soon.

Most often it is a disadvantage, e.g. consider the space cone occupied by 
the STM tip + cantilever. There is complementary demand for not blocking 
out access to the site & for the maximum mechanical rigidity of the tip 
itself and support structure. If one thinks of the suface deposited ("3d 
nanolithography printer"), which shields access to the reaction site, the 
problems are obviously nontrivial. E.g. trying to access the same site with 
two or more tips is obviously _very_ difficult, so a hollow tip would be 
nice, but this has negative impact upon tip solidity... (btw Heckl's group 
in Munich has recently learned to fabricate hollow tubes with a few nm 
inner channel aperture, which are _not_ buckytubes. It's not in the press, 
yet).

The tube approach suggests "molecular Gatling guns" (thanks, Jason), 
where an inert precursor gets activated (e.g. by a laser pulse or a 
electrical field spike) i.e. turned into a reactive moiety only shortly 
before use, repeated in a rapid succession.

Unfortunately, a hard enough whack will rupture bonds. Additionally, e.g. 
blue or UV light bear sufficient energy to (photo)dissotiate bonds, if 
absorbed. You kill your circuitry if you look at it too sharply. This 
requires molecular circuitry to be shielded from shortwave radition, either 
by using red-orange-greenish light and/or embedding it in shielding matrix, 
e.g. engineered proteins. The matrix is needed for autoassembly anyway, 
so it's convenient.

Interspecies reactions require collisions. E.g. methane is kinetically 
inert in oxygen up to certain temperature/pressure, since it is 
spherically shielded by four hydrogens. An instable molecule can be often 
stabilized, if more bulky residues are substituted for the original ones. 
Another instance of it is crystal lattice photochemistry, which typically 
yields different products from the solvated ones. Reactive species are 
often made infinetely stable by embeddinig them in inert matrix, e.g. 
argon under cryogenic conditions. Stuff must be diluted, but it's usually 
enough to be seen by spectroscopy.

Yes. A worthwhile book to read, though a bit laconic on chemistry.

I like Anders' addition of more dimensions to the description space, but
Max's point is very important I feel:  to paraphrase it, nothing is black
or white anymore.  Anders' placement of Extropianism in the above space
provides a very good example, because in the black-and-white world all the
most common futurist ideologies lie at the same right-forward-up corner.
Certainly transhumanism and Extropianism and even my TransIndividualism
become indistinguishable under that coarse 0/1 quantisation.

To take Max's point on board, we need to get out of the black-and-white
world and accept the continuum within the cube.  Only then will we be able
to speak about the shades of grey that make up the real world, and in so
doing, those labels that cause everyone such aggravation might hopefully
get left behind.

Even better than that, this approach opens up the possibility of genuine
scalar comparison along the dimensions selected, and that is halfway
to having strongly objective discussions about these elusive subjects.
That would be a significant achievement.

Rich.

It's frustrated me too, but it's hard to get a web site going *in addition
to* a magazine, a newsletter, conferences, meetings, general admin, and your
studies. Anders, imagine trying to build the magnificent website you created
while *also* doing all these other things!

As far as I know, only one of the links doesn't work. If you tried the
separate ideas page before my last revision, you would have found others,
but that's fixed.

The new issue of Newsweek has an interesting article on "superhormone
therapy" -- the use of hormones to slow, stop, or reverse aspects of aging,
especially in men. The article covers testosterone, DHEA, human growth
hormone, and melatonin. Extropy columnist Dr. Ray Sahelian, gets a mention
-- his book on DHEA is the first one out.

I was pleased to see a report on a promising set of anti-aging treatments in
such a large circulation magazine. The report is reasonably balanced, and
should give the reader the impression that hormone therapy will become routine.

You male readers can also now add another easy biomarker test to see how
youthful and vital you are (in addition to the easy tests for reaction time,
static balance, and visual accommodation): Check the angle of your erection!

Your scenario may be plausible, but I feel that my scenario is more
likely: the
Initial SI (for example an experimenter together with a workstation and
a bunch
of software) is capable of rapid self-augmentation.  Since the
experimenter and
the experiment are likely to be oriented toward developing an SI, the
self-augmentation
is likely to result in rapid intelligence gain. Your sub-human SIs are
presumably computer
only AIs, lacking a human component. I don't see an AI as the likely SI.

As you say, it's possible to view an individual human as a corporate
entity
comprising multiple "sub-personalities." you can then apply socieology
instead
of psychology, and consider averaging the preferences of the "group".
This may or may not be valid for humans: I'm not an expert in any soft
science
and my contrary opinion is therefore only an opinion. However, the
ablilty
to validly model a human this way is no assurance that we can validly
model
an SI this way. An SI is likely to have conscious control of its
internal archecture,
so the postulated subconscious human group-think may not be relevant.

Please note: I'm still not arguing that my model of an SI is the correct
one,
only that it's plausible.

     The late 19th and the late 20th century shared more than
     simply globalization and convergence. Globalization also
     seems to have had the same impact on income distribution: in
     the late 19th century, inequality rose in rich countries and
     fell in poor countries; according to Adrian Wood, the same
     has been true of the late 20th century. Furthermore, while
     George Borjas and Wood think that globalization accounted for
     something like a third to a half of the rise in inequality in
     America and other OECD countries since the 1970s, the late
     19th century evidence suggests at least the same, perhaps
     more. However, those modern economists who favor a rising
     inequality explanation coming from (unskilled) labor-saving
     technological change will be pleased to hear that it probably
     accounted for more than a third of the rising inequality in
     the New World and for more than a half of the falling
     inequality in Europe. It also appears that the inequality
     trends which globalization produced prior to World War I
     were at least partly responsible for the interwar retreat
     from globalization. Will the world economy of the next
     century also retreat from its commitment to globalization
     because of its inequality side effects?

It seems to me that in the absence of a process pushing conformity,
one should expect diversity, at least when we're talking about
motivations across the entire visible universe.  Yes, it's possible
there is such a process we don't know anything about, but this simple
statement does not make the conclusion "plausible", only "posibble".
Otherwise any not-logically-impossible conclusion would be
"plausible".

Most complex systems we know of are capable of rapid
self-augmentation.  People can change, companies can change, and
nations can change.  *Useful* rapid change is a lot harder, however,
and you have offered no plausible argument why such useful rapid
change is any more likely here than for other complex systems.  Again,
yes, it is logically possible.  But that is hardly a plausibility
argument.

Subject: 100% Natural
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

	There is a meme going around now that has infected huge numbers of people.  
The meme is completely irrational, and it is a meme which blocks many 
Extropian and Transhuman memes.  The basic core of the meme is: "natural 
things are superior to artificial things."  It is quite common for an 
advertisement to claim that it's product's greatest advantage is that it is 
100% natural.  Not that it necessarily works better than artificial products, 
but that its naturalness somehow makes it a better product.
	There are several ways of rationally approaching and destroying this meme.  
The first is very direct:  the realization that EVERYTHING is natural, 
including humans and their technology.  This rips out the basic heart of the 
meme which is that there is a distinction between humans and nature.  However, 
that idea is very ingrained in our culture; the idea that humans are 
super-natural; that we and our technology are somehow not part of the process 
of nature.  So, more subversive disinfectants should be used as well.
	These methods involve granting (temporarily) that the basic premise is true; 
that humans are in fact different from nature and thus so is our technology.  
Then you bring up lots of things that are 100% natural, but are seen as very 
bad, like malarya and other horrible diseases.  Starving to death in horrible 
agony is perfectly natural; it happens all the time in the wild, along with 
horribly painful injuries and death.  A high infant mortality rate is 100% 
natural!  Poisonous gasses being emmitted in the atmosphere and wiping out 
nearly all living species is a perfectly natural type of event; it happened 
when certain types of life started producing that horrible poison, oxygen as a 
waste product.  These things are brought up to show that just because 
something's natural, that doesn't mean that it's pleasant or desireable, and 
in fact, most often it isn't.  Most things that are 100% natural are actually 
quite dangerous to humans.
	It's funny to see food products in the supermarket that advertise themselves 
as being 100% natural, because I always think to myself, "Dog shit is 100% 
natural too, but I'm not gonna eat it!"  Poisonous mushrooms are also 100% 
natural, and since they're all-natural, they must be okay to eat, right?  And 
of course, we don't want any artificial preservatives in our food; botulism 
(food poisoning) is much better, because at least it's natural to have food go 
bad and be overrun by all kinds of poisonous bacteria.
	And then there's the advertisements for medicines which claim to be 100% 
natural.  Yeah, right!  Like those pills grew on trees!  But the raw 
ingredients came from the natural world, one might argue, so even though it's 
processed beyond all recognition of what it originally was, it's still 
natural.  A little thinking would show that ALL medicines are 100% natural by 
that logic, since all the chemicals originally came from the natural world.  
And again, a lot of things that are 100% natural can kill you, and so can a 
lot of  synthetic things, so the real criteria for a medicine is how well it 
actually works; whether it's natural or artificial is irrelevant (and this is 
the basic core of the counter-meme; that all things must be evaluated by their 
*actual properties*; their source is irrelevant).  Just because a plant made 
the chemical, that doesn't necessarily make it more effective than a chemical 
that a human makes.  It's a matter for scientific investigation to decide.  
Nature's pharmacy is mostly poison.
	Well, these are just some of the vaccemes to help wipe out the irrational 
meme that "Natural is better."  The basic idea is to make statements or ask 
questions that reveal the blatant ludicrousness of the meme that says, "Nature 
is better."  This type of thinking prevents people from accepting many of the 
life-improving technologies that Extropians generally endorse.  Any type of 
bio-enhancements are looked at as tampering with nature.  Of course, the 
mindless mutations caused by cosmic rays are 100% natural, so they're okay.  
No, they're more than okay, they're better than the genetic engineers could 
ever do, even if they made the exact same mutations, because they're 100% 
NATURAL.

All the electrons used to transmit this message are 100% natural and 
completely recyclable.  Just doing my part to help the environment.  Have a 
nice, 100% natural day!

You must have a different edition than mine. There's no chart on p.38 of my
copy (which is the chapter on Barry Goldwater, titled "With a Jaw Like That
He Can't Lose". I don't see a chart anywhere in my copy. (I have the 1984
Cobden Press edition.) From your description, that chart is different from
the Nolan chart which has economic liberty on one axis and personal liberty
on the other.

Currently, the Nolan Chart is being most effectively promoted by the
Advocates for Self-Government as "The World's Smallest Political Quiz". You
can see it at their website:

        http://www.self-gov.org/

They focus pretty exclusively on US politics. ISIL (http://www.isil.org/)
has a more global view, and then there's the Libertarian Alliance
(http://www.digiweb.com/igeldard/LA/) for readers in the UK.

Personally, I agree with Davin on this. I recognize a right to
self-defense. Killing a human being who has already been secured in
handcuffs and leg-irons simply doesn't look like self-defense to me. It

Ruling things out doesn't come into it:  science doesn't work that way.
The current theories of science rule out FTL travel, but that's all, only
the theories do so --- we don't have any idea what reality herself allows
or doesn't allow.  Tomorrow we may have another theory, and when we test
its hypotheses, reality may choose not to disagree with them.  Only time
will tell, and the lesson of history is most definitely that the word
"impossible" should be used with extreme caution and lots of disclaimers.

I like Anders' addition of more dimensions to the description space, but
Max's point is very important I feel:  to paraphrase it, nothing is black
or white anymore.  Anders' placement of Extropianism in the above space
provides a very good example, because in the black-and-white world all the
most common futurist ideologies lie at the same right-forward-up corner.
Certainly transhumanism and Extropianism and even my TransIndividualism
become indistinguishable under that coarse 0/1 quantisation.

To take Max's point on board, we need to get out of the black-and-white
world and accept the continuum within the cube.  Only then will we be able
to speak about the shades of grey that make up the real world, and in so
doing, those labels that cause everyone such aggravation might hopefully
get left behind.

Even better than that, this approach opens up the possibility of genuine
scalar comparison along the dimensions selected, and that is halfway
to having strongly objective discussions about these elusive subjects.
That would be a significant achievement.

I know that our list administrator has been busy and there have been
problems with the Extropians list, but has anyone else also noticed that
the archive (http://www.lucifer.com/extropians/) hasn't been updated
since Sep 4?

I often rely on the archive to find out who made some post that I'm
interested in because I'm stuck with Microsoft Mail (yuck!) and all list
messages just come to me 'From: postmaster', no Internet message IDs or
anything (I guess that's all stripped off by our SMTP gateway).

(Debunking of said meme deleted).

The creepiest thing about this meme, to me, is the following logic:

Artificial means affected by man; natural means not affected by man.  If
natural is necessarily better than artificial, then anything humans do is
harmful (they are affecting things and thereby making them worse), and humans
are necessarily an evil.

It disturbs me greatly that so many people cheerfully accept a meme which
leads to such a conclusion.

        It makes you wonder.  If a bear was to enter a 'naturalist' (no
offense to any 'naturalists' on this list) camp and maul a few people, would
the naturalists act and kill the bear?  It certainly wouldn't be 'logical' for
them to do so if the bears are natural and they are not.  Humans are animals
(albeit complicated ones).  We, like the animals, have a primal instinct to
protect our kith and kin.  Why this isn't recognized by the average naturalist
is beyond me.

A great article, David!  The "natural is good" meme has been around for
a long time, keeping kindred company with the "traditional is good" one.
I suspect that they'll always be there, along with many others myths and
Ludditish or conservative/regressive tendencies, because a substantial
proportion of people simply don't like the shifting sands of change.
It's not always a predisposition though:  fairly often they get the raw
end of the deal, making a negative attitude to change inevitable.

As part of the fight against the regressive memes, perhaps we can
package up some of your points into a number of pointed signatures ...
like "Natural is good:  Buy EcoMart Botulism, 100% guaranteed!".

For a lot of people, the answer is undoubtedly "Yes".  (:-(

	About the only use I can see in the "natural meme" is that
something "natural" people have eaten for centuries is probably fairly
safe, at least in the short run, while a newly invented chemical might be
dangerous.

	Even here we are not really talking "natural", but familiar!

	Over six months ago I asked the list what I might do to "need less
sleep".  Someone suggested DMAE, Arginine/Ornithine, and Melatonin at
bedtime.  The results were great!  Sorry I can't remember who made the
suggestion!  But, thanks!

	At the time, I thought I was just suffering from the exhaustion of
being involved in a precarious business venture (not my book business)
that required burning the midnight oil quite often.  I was irritated that
I would fall asleep just about any time I sat down to read, watch TV, or
talk to a friend.  When I would go to bed at a normal time I could sleep
no more than 3 or 4 hours.  I would wake up worrying about tasks ahead of
me.  I should have known something more was involved, a chronic sleep
disorder of some type, probably brought on by age....I am 54 now.  The
objective situation was not that different from College or earlier
business problems when I maintained a rather normal sleep schedule.

	100 mg of DMAE and 4 grams of Arginine/Ornthine w/varying doses of
melatonin at bedtime almost immediately restored my power to control my
sleep in a normal manner.  After I have been up late, I might get tired
early the next evening, but can control once again when I decide to go to
bed.  I would estimate that I can now get along with 6 hours of sleep per
day with no discomfort while historically I needed 7-8 hours.

	The amount of melatonin seems to make little difference re:  the
sleep disorder except as regards dreaming.  The DMAE seems to be the main
factor.  Melatonin alone didn't help much though I felt better.  I tried
melatonin before I got the DMAE advice.  I had been taking the
Arginine/Ornithine in the AM with the rest of my supplements previously.

	I began taking DHEA (25mg) in the am about 2 months ago.  No big
change occured though I think I felt a little better and my sex appetitie
increased some.

	A woman friend who has had problems with depression on and off
felt much much better with DHEA.

	Deep ecologists take this to extremes as well.

	They see everything human as unnatural and evil.

	They even try to define man as a cancer to the Eco-Sphere.

	The analogy is very flawed as I think we can all agree.  Cancer is
a malfuncting cell, not an organism trying to reproduce and extend its
range as are humans.

	Or is there another theory of cancer these days?

Well, cancer occurs when a cell stops obeying the growth-inhibition
signals from its surroundings, and in one way or another finds a way to
circumvent the programmed cell death and immune system. It could quite
well be said to try to extend the range of its lineage, which means that
in some sense the deep ecologists are right - we are no longer following
the old rules. The question is of course if one can view the ecology as an
organism (Gaia) as they do; that is very close to the now defunct idea of
"the harmony of nature". 

Cancers are really evolution in action; the proliferating cells mutate 
and adapt to their surroundings, sometimes coming up with great solutions 
that strongly help them in the short run but are disastrous in the long 
run (metastasis). We have to avoid getting into that kind of trap.

Yes, but I did not imply that things are binary. Note the word "scale" in
my original post. Even the usual left-right-scale is used as a
one-dimensional way of measuring how "left" or "right" people and groups
are (The Moderates are to the right of the People's Party who are usually
to the right of the Social Democrats...). Transhumanists of different 
kinds form a cloud of views in the forward-up direction.

I've seen that discussed under the subject, "Post-Scarcity Economics" (try
Altavista, my DNS is acting up so I can't get URLs very easily right now).

I considered making a web page on that topic. That is, I considered it until
Ken Kittlitz suggested the perfect title for it, "The 'Counting Your

In A CMOS transistor the voltage on the gate controls the current through              
the device, the rod logic equivalent is the interlock, the movement of a
rod is dependent on the position of a control rod. Drexler's interlocks 
are just two pyridazine rings, only 20 atoms for both. A CMOS logic gate  
must have a large capacitor and that slows the signal down, it takes eons
for the capacitor to charge up, A rod logic gate does not need anything like 
a capacitor so it has much less signal delay.  Drexler is designing for 
10^17 logic elements per cubic centimeter, I can't see why he can't make it.

Because after the January 28 1994 issue of Science by Madison and Schuman 
we know that the brain has a huge amount of redundancy, LTP spreads out. 
If you change the strength of one synapse you also change the strength of
thousands of other ones, so they can't hold independent data. It's not
like new values are being recalculated, the synapses are being crudely 
changed by the diffusion of nitric oxide produced by the original synapse.

Consider a computer with the smallest possible memory, just one bit. The
computer could be in two states, zero and one. Now record something into the 
computers memory, for example one. You have reduced the states the machine
can be in, from 2 to 1 in this case, and because the entropy of an object is 
the logarithm of the number of ways the parts of the object can be rearranged 
without changing its macroscopic attributes, that means you have reduced the 
Entropy of the machine too.
      
According to the second law of Thermodynamics you can locally reduce the 
Entropy of something but it takes energy to do it. The absolute minimum  
energy it takes to erase one bit of information and record something different 
in its  place is  ln(2)kT , k is Boltzmann's  constant 1.381 X10^-23 J/K, and 
T is the temperature of the computer in degrees Kelvin. This is not a lot of
energy by everyday standards, but it is free energy that must be dissipated
as heat if you want to erase one bit of information. With reversible 
computing, that is where the output uniquely determines the input, nothing is 
erased in computation so you don't have this energy loss and a logical 
operation can be performed with an amount of energy that is arbitrarily close 
to zero.

None of this is an important consideration to chip designers, today's  logic
circuits are so huge, and they deal in such a tiny amount of information, 
that the effect is utterly trivial. Chip designers can safely ignore this, 
Nanotechnology engineers can not. In the early days there were some 
embarrassing incidences where people thought they were designing a nano 
computer, but when you looked closely at it and the amount of heat the thing 
would give off if operated at the design speed, you realized that what they 
were really designing was a first rate high explosive. They do a lot better
now.

A message can be detected but NOT without you knowing it was detected, the 
idea is to use Quantum Cryptography to send a One Time Pad of numbers to the 
person you want to talk to. With a random One Time Pad you can generate a 
perfect encryption scheme, even if to everybody's surprise it turns out that 
P=NP, even if your opponent has a quantum computer, even if your opponent has 
a computer of infinite power, he can never read your message. Despite its 
perfect security it has severe practical limitations, how do you distribute 
the One Time Pad to the person you want to talk with? You can't send the pad 
electronically, if your electronic channel is not secure then an eavesdropper 
can tap your line and get a copy of the pad, if your channel is already 
secure then you don't need the pad. The only secure method is to  physically 
hand a disk with the pad on it to the person you want to talk to and then 
hand him another one when that one gets used up. That's not practical in most 
cases, certainly not for Crypto Anarchy in an economy based on anonymous 
electronic money.

Public Key Cryptography solves the key distribution problem but at a (small) 
price, it is breakable in theory but probably not in practice. In a year or 
two it will be expensive but possible to break a 512 bit key, a 1024  bit key 
would be astronomically more difficult. Many users of PGP have a 2048 bit key, 
even with Nanotechnology there is not enough matter in the observable universe 
to make a machine that can break a key of that size before the heat death of 
the universe, or the Omega point whichever comes first. We can be absolutely 
certain that a 2048 key will never be broken.. unless..

Unless somebody finds a way to improve existing factoring algorithms 
by a lot. An improvement of a measly few hundred trillion percent would by 
useless, I said a lot. This doesn't seem very likely, but it has not been  
proven to be impossible. There is one other possibility.

Unless Quantum Computers are possible and somebody actually manages to build 
one. (Such a machine would revolutionize the world so much that breaking your 
PGP key would probably be the last thing on your mind, but let's ignore that 
for now.) Would this mean the end of Crypto Anarchy? No, because we can use
quantum mechanics on our side too, we can use Quantum Cryptography, and unlike 
Quantum Computers we know this will work because it's already been done. 
This is how:

I send you a bunch of photons, each photon is polarized in one of 4 
directions, horizontal, vertical, left-diagonal and right diagonal, - | \ / . 
In this example I send you 10 photons polarized as follows 
| | / - - \ - | - / .

You have a polarization detector, you can set your detector to measure the 
horizontal and vertical photons (+) OR you can set it to measure the 
left-diagonal and right diagonal photons (x). The laws of physics do not 
allow you to measure one photon both ways, because measuring one destroys all 
information about the other.

You set your detector at random, let's say you set it to find rectilinear 
photons and let's say you have guessed correctly and it really is a 
rectilinear photon. If you can detect the photon after it passes through your 
polarized material, you will correctly deduce that it is a horizontal photon. 
If you can not detect a photon after it hits your polarizing material you 
will correctly deduce that the photon is vertical.

What if you guessed incorrectly when you set your detector, what if you set 
it to detect a rectilinear photon but I send you a diagonal polarized photon? 
Then the photon will hit your polarizing material at a 45 degree angle so 
there is a 50% chance the photon will get through, a 50% chance it will not. 
In other words you get a random result.

I send you 10 photons polarized as follows               | | / - - \ - | - /  
At random you set your polarization detector as follows  x + + x x x + x + + 
So you might claim the photons were polarized as follows / | - \ / \ - / - |
 
Now you tell me over an insecure channel how you set your detector for each 
photon, Big Brother is free to listen in, it won't help him. I tell you over 
the same channel which settings on you polarization detector were correct, in 
this example settings number 2,6,7 and 9 were correct    * | * * * \ - * - *
We only use those readings and junk the others, and we agree that horizontal 
and right diagonal photon means 1, and vertical and left diagonal means 0. 
So we have sent the number 0011 and we can be as certain as we want to be 
that there has been no eavesdropping.

An eavesdropper can not know what type of photon is being sent, and just like 
you must guess what direction to set his polarization detector. He will be 
wrong 50% of the time and when he is he will change the polarization of the 
photon and give himself away.  We compare N bits in the string of numbers 
sent over an insecure channel, if there are no discrepancies then there is 
only one chance in 2^N that somebody is eavesdropping, so we can use the 
remaining bits as a one time pad. As I said this  has already been done and 
messages have been sent about 35 miles in this way.  I learned about this 
stuff mostly from Bruce Schneir's wonderful book  "Applied Cryptography".

I honestly don't know. A few years ago I would have laughed at the idea
because it seemed that such a machine would need to operate with absolute
precision and be completely isolated from the environment, and that is a 
ridiculous idea. When they started to find quantum error correcting codes I 
stopped laughing. Sometimes I think that at the last minute we'll find some 
law of Physics that will prevent a bizarrely counter intuitive object like a 
Quantum Computer from existing in the real world. On the other hand, the 
results from the last couple of years seem to point in the opposite direction.  
We may know in a few years if this is really going to work or if we'll just 
have to settle for old fashioned Nanotechnology.

Just how bizarre would this gadget be? If a Quantum Computer can produce 
meaningful output information from examining the quantum mechanical state of 
its memory, then there is no reason you couldn't run the machine in reverse, 
feed in information and change the quantum mechanical state of the memory in 
a meaningful way. In other words, a quantum mechanical matter manipulator that 
works at the atomic level or smaller. Yes I know its crazy but don't blame me, 
I didn't invent Quantum Mechanics.

Nanotechnology by definition means the ability to control atoms at the atomic
scale, if you can't store 176 bits in 176 atoms then you don't have
Nanotechnology. I should add that there is no theoretical reason that you 
can't store more than one bit of information in one atom, a lot more, but 
Drexler is an old fashioned conservative sort and he makes no use of this 
fact in any of his designs.
 
How big would a rod logic nanocomputer need to be to equal the power of a 
modern mainframe? Drexler figures it would need to have about 150 billion 
atoms, a cube 1000 nanometers on a edge would do it, that's about as big as a 
mitochondrion. You could fit well over a thousand of such mainframes into a 
cell of average size.


                >Apropos picotech, see the post on femtotech I forwarded to
                > the >H list ;)


I remember hearing speculation about femtomachines that operated at a scale 
of 10^-15m . The idea was to build things with strangelet quark structures. 
Unfortunately I don't see how this could work, objects would not be rigid, 
and you can't build machines with a liquid. There is little more I can say on 
that subject because unlike nanotechnology, building things at this scale  
would require a scientific breakthrough and they are inherently unpredictable.
By the way, it's not very clear to anybody if a scientific breakthrough is
needed to make  a Quantum  Computer or not.
               

                >Mechanosynthesis has not been shown to work.


We can do chemistry, and not just physics on atoms one at a time. In the 
June 16 1995 issue of Science it's shown that if electrons of the correct 
energy are shot at an atom from the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope 
the atom will resonate and the resulting vibration will break the chemical 
bond. The procedure is somewhat faster than expected and does not require any 
exotic conditions such as very low temperature. J.W.Lyding, one of the authors 
of this report, is quoted as saying " We'd like to make small, electronic 
devices on the nanometer scale".  
          

                >This is a problem. The defect threshold in the clone 
                >structure must not have _any_ negative impact on positioning 
                >tip accuracy. 
                 

Some error is acceptable because it would not be cumulative, such is the 
advantage of working in the digital domain, and Nanotechnology is certainly
digital. You may need to build a rod 7 carbon atoms long, but you will never
need to worry about a rod 7.01764513 carbon atoms long.
                            

                >The machine needs to build structures from the outside,

Why? Neurons are machines and they can do it, but I like the idea of pre 
wiring lots of connections in 3 dimensions and then changing their weight.

This appeared on the ExI-LA list, but it thought it might be of interest to
those further away. This is Nathaniel Branden's first public talk on
Objectivism since the notorious split with Ayn Rand in 1968. Several LA
Extropians, and perhaps N. Cal Extropians will be going to listen.

I think it is hard to tell what the actuall effects will be, since we do 
not know yet the limitations of nanotech. If strong nanotechnology is 
possible, then economy as we know it will be completely different (an 
information-based economy might work in moderate cases, but if rapidly 
self-augmenting SI becomes possible even that fails). If nanotechnology 
is very limited the situation could be as in Brin's _Earth_, where it is 
used for specialized applications but nothing more.

This seems too strong a claim to me.  Nanotech would change the
relative values of differnet kinds of production costs, and we are
uncertain about the magnitude of various effects.  But all of the
possibilities seem understanable with basic economic theory, and not
"completely different".  I think this is even true with artificial
intelligence. 

I think folks are too stuck on the notion that changes must be
incomprehensible - you don't know what you can or can't understand
until you try.  And you haven't really tried until you've used the
best intellectual tools available.

I do endorse this idea to a degree because it allows more products such as
herbal products to market because the normal privitized medical area can't
generate enough cash from them to make them profitable to market. Also
slightly varying doses are better than exactly measured amounts because our
bodies were never made for exact amounts because out bodies enjoy a degree
of randomness and change rather than stale static amounts.

        In this case, *both* of you are correct.  When the creation of
nanotechnology becomes manifest, there will certainly be a nearly
instantaneous turnabout in the current economy.  Initially.  Ones who are
equipped with nanites will gain much recognition as 'cyborgs' and
'heretics'.  Mothers will be bending down to their children, pointing and
whispering at the ones with the enhancements.  Initially.

        Eventually, however, nanotechnology will become commonplace and
tolerated around the world.  People will no longer know the difference
between an enhanced human and an unenhanced one.  It just takes a little bit
of time for people to get used to the notion of 'bettering'.  Even those who
do not agree with nanotechnology will have to accept it...they'll have no
choice.  One of the most prominent trends in nature is 'adaptation through
change'.  I think mankind will follow this trend whether or not it is
entirely accepted.

I do not think it is true that "artificial" means "bad" or
"dangerous", but a strong case can be made that many if not most
artifical substances and processes made in the last 50 years have been
released without testing their effects thoroughly or at all, and these
many of these effects have been found to be detrimental.  Cf. "Why
Things Bite Back" for plenty of examples.

People don't shun GoreTex rain jackets or Polypro camping underwear,
because those things are in a class whose members haven't had
detrimental effects, save a few yeast infections from nylon panties.
People do shun artificial food products because so many of them have
turned out to be carcinogens, mutagens, and so on.

The solution to this isn't trying to inject everyone with an
"artificial is good" meme, it's to make sure that artificial actually
*is* good.

I don't think many "naturalists" disagree with self-defense.  What
they disagree with (at least what *I* disagree with, to the extent
that I am a "naturalist") is using living systems as industrial inputs
in the same way as if they were, say, mineral deposits.  And in
destroying these living systems for our convenience and taste, rather
than out of necessity, when there are suitible alternatives.

I'd rather pay 10% more for recycled paper than to cut down 1000 year
old trees to pulp more cheaply.  If that makes me enemies on this list
(as it did in this lists's early days), so be it.

If our capabilities are growing exponentially, and we gain only a
constant factor by destroying irreplacable natural systems, why can we
not simply delay our ambitions (e.g., "the singularity") for a month,
and gain entire ecosystems in return?

This is an idea that goes back to 1987.  I have told a couple of people 
about it, but never really announced it.  I think it is an idea whose time 
has come.  

I want to introduce a new game, called Checkmate (aka hyperchess).    
It is the same as chess, with two exceptions:  

1.  There is no such thing as a draw or a resignation in Checkmate.  
You always play the game to a conclusion.  Either it ends with a mate, 
or it is a null game, in which mate cannot be forced.  A game is not 
declared to be null until it is obviously and provably null.  

2.  The players are teams, consisting of humans and computers 
working together.  There can be as many humans as you want -- as 
many as you can get to work together without getting in each other's 
way.  Coordinating their efforts is part of the challenge of hyperchess.  
A team can either be led by a computer, which makes the moves with 
advice from the humans, who are in turn using other computers with 
specialized functions; or a team may be led by a human, who plays 
with the advice of other humans, all of whom are using computers.   
Another possibility is that a team may not have a leader at all.  And 
of course it is possible to have a minimum team of an individual human 
and one computer -- with either the human or the computer acting as 
lead player.  

In other words, your task, as a player of hyperchess, is to design and 
build a SuperIntelligence.  How you do it is up to you.   

I want to issue a challenge to the Extropians:  starting a couple of years 
from now, let's have an annual Checkmate tournament.  

The interesting thing about this is that designing a SuperIntelligence 
requires designing a mind.  How do you do that?  This is basically a 
philosophical problem.  You (the Extropian team) can use Ayn Rand's 
metaphysics, Ian Goddard's logic, Max More's philosophy of mind, 
Marvin Minsky's insights into AI, Tim Freeman's expertise in 
computer science, and so forth.  There are many people on the list 
who could make theoretical contributions, and many programmers 
who would enjoy writing the code that will have to be written.  

Meanwhile I will also be designing a SuperIntelligence, using my 
metaphysics, my logic, and so forth, and recruiting a team to help me 
write the code and play the game.  

I want to extend this challenge to other memes as well.  For example, 
I'm going to go to meetings of some Campus Christian groups, 
at various colleges, and tell them about this.  They can design a 
SuperIntelligence based on their metaphysics (monotheist), their logic 
(Thomist), their philosophy of mind, and so forth, and they can use 
Christian chessplayers to play the game and Christian programmers to 
write the code.  (Christian programmers do exist.)  This idea is not new 
to them -- according to the Bible, the church itself is a kind of 
SuperIntelligence, with Christ as the head and the church as the body.  

There are various other memes that might want to enter teams.  IBM 
can enter Big Blue, assisted by human players.  

May the best SI win.  May the best philosophy win.  

Lyle

The Cerebral Code
Thinking a Thought in the Mosaics of the Mind
William H. Calvin

The Cerebral Code is a new understanding of how Darwinian processes=20
could operate in the brain to shape mental images in only seconds,=20
starting with shuffled memories no better than the jumble of our=20
nighttime dreams, but evolving into something of quality, such as a=20
sentence to speak aloud. Jung said that dreaming goes on continuously=20
but you can't see it when you are awake, just as you can't see the=20
stars in the daylight because it is too bright. Calvin's is a theory=20
for what goes on, hidden from view by the glare of waking mental=20
operations, that produces our peculiarly human type of consciousness=20
with its versatile intelligence.

As Piaget emphasized in 1929, intelligence is what we use when we=20
don't know what to do, when we have to grope rather than using a=20
standard response. Calvin tackles a mechanism for doing this=20
exploration and improvement offline, as we think before we act or=20
practice the art of good guessing.

Surprisingly, the subtitle's mosaics of the mind is not a  literary=20
metaphor. For the first time, it is a description of a mechanism of=20
what appears to be an appropriate level of explanation for many mental=20
phenomena, that of hexagonal mosaics of electrical activity that=20

two-dimensional mosaic is predicted to grow and dissolve much as the=20
sugar crystals do in the bottom of a supersaturated glass of iced tea.

No need to wait that long. Already members of the MIT wearable developer 
group, who go about looking slightly like Borgs (Is there a fault to use 
DGPS to know where you are? A cellular modem? A Linux box, running emacs 
& a BioMuse clone for input + a speech input?) experience slight 
alienation of these, who are still merely human... Anyway, they often see 
them cross over to the opposite side of the road... Hehe.

Browsing Science News over my morning coffee, I found an encouraging report:
The old idea that memory impairment in older people results from the loss of
neurons in the hippocampus has been challenged by a couple of recent studies.

Instead of looking at a thin slice of rat hippocampus, researchers counted
neurons in 3D pieces. They found no evidence that the older rats with memory
impairment had fewer neurons. Though this study needs to be done on human
hippocampuses, this gives reason to think that memory impairment results
from changes in function of neurons (making different proteins, etc.) rather
than in neuronal loss. That's good, because it should make preservation and
restoration of function easier.

These are two different fears.  Strange matter would not expand at the
speed of light, but should only convert other nuclei matter it comes into
direct physical contact with.

My thanks to the several people who quickly jumped in and created graphics
for the filming of the extremely new Extropy Institute web site.

The filming (for Strange Universe) went well, and the producer was quite
effusive in praising us for the content. I hope we stand out that way to the
viewers too. When the show airs (to 5-10 million viewers, claims the
producer) in a few weeks, it should be a major boost for the new site and
help spread Extropian ideas further.

ExI Webmaster Eric Watt Forste and I look forward to developing the ExWeb
with your continued input.

Thanks,

Max

On this instance I agree with him because I consider natural environments
asthetically invaluable. There are many things in which humans haven't
discovered or conquored yet and to see the engineering of the laws of
physics and spontaneous orders in living animated examples is much better
information quantity and quality than something generalized averaged and
slapped in a book. Nature is a far better engineer than any of us. Nature
engineers more complex and exotic stuff although much slower. We engineer
quickly but bulky and we will eventually completely surpass nature's
engineering strengths but not now. The reason nature is a greater engineer
is because it looks at a problem in infinite directions. Human engineers
look to accomplish a certain task with a few variables but nature looks at
infinite variables. This doesn't mean I think environmentalism should be
taken to it's extreme where an entire project must be stopped for a single
animal such as the snail darter. If the snail darter was the only reason to
stop the project, they should simply move it to another similar habitat.
Again I must say...Arcologies! Either that or make a molecular map of the
Earth by having nanites race through the planet and reporting back data.

In the book "The Lost World" they meantioned that we could never recover the

that the dinosaurs could've been intelligent enough to host memes?

Strange matter would be a planetary disaster and vacuum tear would be a
universe-wide disaster. Lets just hope there isn't a vacuum tear headed our
way accidently triggered by some distant advanced civilization. We wouldn't
be able to see a vacuum tear coming. This could explain why we haven't made
'contact' yet. :(
Heres another interesting theory. What if something we do in the future
causes an explosion in the past which screws up the original universe
singularity and causes the big bang? Then we would be responsible for our
own creation! We wouldn't notice much here in the present but whatever we
did would cause the big bang. Isn't theory fun?

okay, i will stop lurking.

has anybody read "Reversing Human Aging" by Fossel?  it purports that the underlying
mechanism of aging is the telomere shortening which occurs when a cell divides.  i am
only about half way through, but so far it has been a nice write up on cellular aging.

the author claims telomere shortening is the cause behind the hayflict limit.

I think the word "incomprehensible" arises so often in this context not
so much because it is meant verbatim, but because so many economists and
other specialists tied into today's systems appear so utterly incapable
of making the (fairly small) mental leap under which nanotech unravels
almost entirely the fabric of today's systems and institutions.  Sure,
it's not really "incomprehensible" at all, but it might just as well be,
as far as they are concerned.

I want to introduce a new game, called Checkmate (aka hyperchess).    
It is the same as chess, with two exceptions:  

1.  There is no such thing as a draw or a resignation in Checkmate.  
You always play the game to a conclusion.  Either it ends with a mate, 
or it is a null game, in which mate cannot be forced.  A game is not 
declared to be null until it is obviously and provably null.  

2.  The players are teams, consisting of humans and computers 
working together.  There can be as many humans as you want -- as 
many as you can get to work together without getting in each other's 
way.  Coordinating their efforts is part of the challenge of hyperchess.  
A team can either be led by a computer, which makes the moves with 
advice from the humans, who are in turn using other computers with 
specialized functions; or a team may be led by a human, who plays 
with the advice of other humans, all of whom are using computers.   
Another possibility is that a team may not have a leader at all.  It is also 
possible to have a minimum team, consisting of an individual human 
and one computer -- with either the human or the computer acting as 
lead player.  

In other words:  your task, as a player of hyperchess, is to design and 
build a SuperIntelligence.  How you do it is up to you.   

I hereby issue a challenge to the Extropians:  two years years from now, 
in September of 1988, the first annual Checkmate tournament will take 
place.   Be there or be square.  

The interesting thing about this is that to play hyperchess, you have to 
design a SuperIntelligence.  In other words, you have to design a mind.  
How do you do that?  This is a philosophical problem -- or a problem in 
philosophical engineering.  You (the Extropian team) can use Ayn 
Rand's metaphysics, Ian Goddard's logic, Max More's philosophy of 
mind, Marvin Minsky's insights into AI, Tim Freeman's expertise in 
computer science, and so forth, to design a SuperIntelligence.  There are 
many people on the list who could make theoretical contributions, and 
many programmers who can write the code that will have to be written.  

Meanwhile I will also be designing a SuperIntelligence, using my 
metaphysics, my logic, and so forth, and recruiting a team to help me 
write the code and play the game.  

I am going to extend this challenge to other memes as well.  This fall 
I am going to be travelling to various college campuses.  My main 
purpose is to recruit students for my own projects, but I will also 
attend meetings of on-campus Christian organizations, and invite them 
to enter a team in the hyperchess tournament.  They can design a 
SuperIntelligence based on their metaphysics (monotheist), their logic 
(Thomist), their philosophy of mind, and so forth, and they can use 
Christian chessplayers to play the game and Christian programmers to 
write the code.  (Yes, Christian programmers do exist.)  The  idea of a 
SuperIntelligence is not new to them -- according to the Bible, the 
church itself is a kind of SuperIntelligence, with Christ as the head and 
the church as the body.  The idea of competition is not new to them, 
either;  way back in the Roman Empire, they set out to be superior to 
the heathens in every way -- intellectual, spiritual, social, whatever.  

There are various other memes that might want to enter teams.  
IBM can enter Big Blue, assisted by human players.  That is the level 
on which the game will be played.  Surely the Extropian world-meme 
can compete on this level... ?    

SuperIntelligences have existed for a long time.  Corporations are 
SuperIntelligences; so are armies, so are nation-states, so are churches.  
The only new factor is that now SuperIntelligences can make use of 
computers, but this doesn't change the situation in any essential way.  

May the best SI win.  May the best philosophy win.

You probably mean me. In my view you have failed to offer a coherent
argument for such "unraveling".  Maybe your leap isn't so small.

[ ACF stands for Automated Collaborative Filtering if you forgot]

The September issue of Wired carried an article by
famous-as-a-visionary John Perry Barlow, entitled
"The Powers That Were". 

 JPB calls US democracy "Government by Hallucinating Mob,
driven mad by television", explaining that much of the
knowledge about current social issues is available to the
public via advertisement-sponsored TV (and other mass media)
that selects both content and presentation with the goal to
keep the audience near their TV sets, so that they can see
more ads and make more money for advertisers and media owners.
As the result, juicy/silly non-issues manufactured for
keeping the lowest common denominator bottom glued to the
couch, steal public attention from real serious problems -
and then the populace elects its representatives to "handle"
these TV-induced collective hallucinations.

  JPB suggests some observations on how U.S. got into this
pitiful state, and ideas on how the Cyberspace can help
restructure social knowledge-delivery and decision-making
mechanisms.   He does not mention ACF - though, in my opinion,
ACF has the potential of playing a very significant role in
intelligent demassifying and fine-tuning of the architecture
of social conversation.

  Now, the question is, will the ACF developers steer their
technology towards commercial goals, trying to develop
"personalized glues" to paste each individual bottom to its
couch, and deliver whatever-pleases-you-personally to keep
you in front of the screen even longer and see more - and
better targeted - ads  than TV ever could - and make still
more money?  Or will ACF system development be based on an
effort to leverage the potential of the technology for
intentional social engineering?

  My expectation is that this will be business-as-usual:
efforts will be made to make money, but the resulting
technology will have some social-restructuring side-effects.
The cultural consequences should be somewhat beneficial - this
time.  We just seem to be lucky to live in the technological
period when the irresponsible-as-usual development happens
to bring positive results. It started recently and may end
well within our lifetimes.  Maybe, by that time we'll learn
to rely more on vision than on luck.   Maybe, not.

This may be true, it is a popular theory and appears to fit known facts 
well. But I'm not sure telomere shortening is the only cause of ageing, 
there may be other cellular and systematic causes.

Perhaps we could prevent ageing by giving the cells telomerase, but we 
have to be careful not to induce cancer.

Birds do (they learn songs from their parents and environment, although
the exact sounds are genetic; they can also be trained in various ways),
and they have (probably) descended from dinosaurs. I'm not sure about 
how much reptiles can learn, they appear to be somewhat inflexible. So 
I'm still undecided, but my guess is that they had learned behaviors.

This is an interesting, and common, angle on nature: anthropomorphization
coupled with linguistic personification. Within a Darwinian framework I find
it hard to consider the workings of nature as a gestalt entity; rather, it
seems to be a series of interacting events in which there is no prior
assessment of effect, no plan. So 'nature' doesn't look at a problem in any
direction at all.

The 'nature' of geophysical activity is merely a pseudo-chaotic amalgam of
atmospheric and tectonic interactions. The 'nature' of biological
development is merely a day-to-day battle between individual organisms, and
between organisms and their environment.

If 'nature' could be personified, since 'she' does not care about effect,
'her' approach to engineering and it's environmental effects seems
remarkable similar to that of humankind in many ways: do something and see
what happens, it'll sort itself out in to a balance point after a while.

One common view of Darwinian evolution is population drift on a 
multidimensional fitness landscape, a parallel (multiple individua) 
energy minimization/search by hopping (since Darwin != Lamarck) along the 
fitness gradients.

The fitness is pretty noisy due to random factors (face it, there 
is just dumb luck & cruel chance at times), and other individua/species 
present modulate it heavily, which makes the landscape highly dynamic.
 
Nevertheless, the result is surprisingly modular and effective, in a 
certain sense one can speak of a gestalt, of the tinkering watchmaker. 
Even though there is no "meaning" in meaning, the Darwinian evolution 
leaves a stamp of purposeful design on its products. Since its signature 
resembles those imprinted by personal, human shapers no wonder there is a 
strong sense of kinship if the latter happen to evaluate the works of the 
non-personal designer. 

Anthromorphism can at times be constructive, just think of the detailed 
off-shelf self models we use. While speaking of tools, why not utilizing 
these?

Careful, here. Evaluate the result, not the designer. If 'caring' is 
energy minimization, then yes, the process 'cares'. Don't see too much 
sense in assigning emotions to processes, even for the sake of the model.

Tracking most human designs will reveal an interesting thing: there is a 
Darwin design evolution all right, and no mistake. It's an old view, some 
model cases are in the literature.

Of course we humans have something evolution lacks: we can afford design 
discontinuities, directly going for a distant maximum (using our 
assumption about the shape of the function) while skipping interim steps, 
which might be even nonviable. But, remember, we ourselves are products 
of the evolution! There is no accounting for what evolution can do, for 
to wit: it's a metamethod.

 Commercial companies are very good at providing motivation
for development, finding resources and rewarding contributions
of ideas and effort - this seems to be a winning combination
when an idea is relatively simple and can be developed into
a product by a relatively small group of people in a reasonable
time frame.  When one wants to design a global system that would
benefit many diverse groups of people in the long run, then open
social discussion would appear essential.
  Now, what if one tries to develop a business providing services
with a wide range of implications?  Like a new system of knowledge
distribution on the Net?  Is it possible to find an approach that
would promote business interests (profit, market share, security, PR,
not scaring away investors and not giving advantage to competition,
etc.)  of the company, and at the same time involve people in
academia and general public in discussing optimal structure of the
venture and its product line, writing additional software, choice of
which parts of the sytem should remain proprietary and which should
be made open?

  I think this is a generally interesting issue - and it seems to be
growing in importance as more and more businesses and products become
parts of the global system. Now I also find myself quite practically
interested in it, as I am working on development of Automated
Collaborative Filtering (ACF) systems for Internet.

 I would appreciate any general or practical ideas you may have on
the subject, or references to any relevant sources.

Let's hope it is the former.  The term "social engineering" refers not to
enlightened use of technology, but achieving political goals through the
use of force or subterfuge.

Likewise, most "social sciences" have little to do with science.  Their
role is to provide the justification for social engineering (i.e., backing
up pet  theories with mountains of statistics).  My favorite example is a
book written in the 1960s by Ghana's dictator (Kwame Nkrumah?).  In it, he
offered "scientific formulae" to determine when conditions were ripe for
revolution, and how to make a revolution.  I hope I still have it -- it's a
classic. <g>

In one of his books (Breakfast of Champions I think, but it's been a
long time) a new crystaline form of water is made or discovered, which
is solid at room tempurature.  It "freezes" any water that comes in
contact with it.  The world ends.


Of course, this is just a plot device: the book isn't "about" that at
all.  Highly recommended.

No, you were referring to others using the word "incomprehensible",
not to yourself, and I followed suit.  I don't know if you comprehend
it or not --- see below.

I did offer a coherent argument based on a very small leap in response
to your request for an explanation about a month or two ago.  You did
not answer that item, so I don't know what your thoughts are on the
matter at present.  A reply would help.

The problem here is "rudimentary."  Quantum mechanics is not a theory
of everything.  It is just a little better model of small scales than
classical (i.e. Newtonian) mechanics.  If you go to high energies
(large velocities, small wavelengths) you need relativistic quantum
mechanics for making predictions.  If you have a system with
a large number of particles, you need statistical quantum mechanics.
If you want both, well, then you'd better have a nice cosmology... :)

So, the answer is "no."  But it's not "no because quantum mechanics
forbids it."  It's "no because experiment shows that the universe
doesn't work like that."  And quantum mechanics is not a very good tool
for modeling the particular experiment you're mentioning.
(Are you feeling philosophical yet?  A common QM entry-level mistake
 is trying to "intuitively" understand quantum mechanics.  Beware!)

>Ive stopped lurking.

Good for you, but a question like that belongs to sci.physics or
some such.  I'd be surprised if it weren't a FAQ.

But it does shape life to the laws of physics so the laws shape the physical
structure of the organisms. There are organisms we could never possibly
grasp how they existed until we ran into them face to face. This I believe
will be true of any life we discover out in space because the humanoid shape
is a direct molded evolution of tree swinging primates.

Yeah but nature knows everything already, we must learn everything first.

Something I read recently is that in Bombay, India they are attempting to
create this form of matter. If the theory is correct then they are really
stupid and should be considered an international threat. Thats like a lab
full of scientists turning on the first atomic bomb in their lab to see if
it works!

          Assume the worst happens, and an infowar assault takes down major
          life sustaining portions of the infrastructure. What do we do
          about it? How do we minimize the damage and protect the victims
          and citizens? These esteemed experts will tell you what they
          think and then invite your comments.

          Kenneth Bass III, Cyber-Attorney, Wash DC
          If a company is attacked, and it loses significant assets, what
          are the recourses of the stake holders? How do we measure and
          evaluate the losses and responsibility? On the military side,
          what constitutes an Act of War and what steps are necessary to
          formulate a response?

          "High-Technology Crime: Investigating Cases Involving Computers"
          How can you tell you are under attack? Once you determine you
          are, how do you make a case which will stand up in court? How do
          you collect evidence? How do you involve law enforcement without
          compromising your efforts? Experts share years of experience with
          you.
        o B4 - Naval Post Graduate School Session

     If you've ever wanted to know how hackers think; what makes them tick
     and how they became the first Information Warriors, here are the
     people who can answer your questions. These sessions are among the
     most popular at every InfoWarCon. Security is ultimately a 'people
     problem,' and a video of actual social engineering will be shown to
     show how easy it is to exploit..

Completely, the tool of government/corporate control is far subtle than

I agree, although it is not going that way currently. Much like the
Internet was hyped as a true "grassroots" media, with the individual
engaged in true two-way conversation. I still hold this hope, although
with the advent of the web and decline of usenet, I doubt it will happen.

If you give the technology to the hands of the people, not the elites,
then you will find true social change occuring. Unless the media as a
whole becomes a
forum for debate rather than advertising, any new media will be tdominated
by conglomerates. The thing is, government is too incompetent to effect
this, and corporations are too selfish. >

If 2 electrons in a atom are in a very large orbit they must have a very small 
velocity. According to the uncertainty principle, the better you know the 
velocity of something the less you know its position. In this case we know a 
lot about the electron's velocity (very close to zero) so we know little about
its position. The effective size of these electrons would be huge, they would 
overlap, when we measure the spin of an electron we can't be certain which 
electron we are measuring so the "message" would be random. 
                             
It has been shown experimentally that it is possible to change things far 
away faster than light, instantly in fact, but that's not enough to sent a 
message.  To send a message I must not only change something but the receiver 
must be able to compare that change with something, otherwise the message 
will look random to him.
         
Some physical processes produce 2 photons that have the same polarization but 
move in opposite directions. A billion years before I was born somebody in 
the Virgo Cluster started making pairs of photons that have identical but  
unknown polarization. He sent one stream of photons to the earth, a billion  
light years away, he sent another stream of photons to the Coma cluster in  
the opposite direction from the earth a billion and one light years away.  
A billion years later  on Earth I spin my polarizer to a random direction,  
record the position, observe if the photon made it through the detector or  
not, then record that too. Now I spin the polarizer again and do the same  
thing for the next photon and then for the next several thousand  photons.  
I know that a year from now a friend of mine in the Coma Cluster will  
perform the exact same experiment on his stream of photons and I decide to  
visit him. I get in a space  ship with my records and blast off for the Coma  
Cluster at 99% of the speed of light.

After 2 billion years I arrive in the Coma Cluster and compare notes with my  
friend. I notice that the direction I had my polarizer turned to and the   
direction my friend had his turned to were different, not very surprising  
since both were picked at random, but then I find something astounding.  
The square of the cosign of the angle between the 2 detectors for each photon 
pair is proportional to the probability that a photon will make it through my  
friend's detector.

I have instantly changed something that is 2 billion light years away and was  
made long before dinosaurs walked the earth. Pretty weird. Unfortunately this  
effect can not be used for faster than light communication because before I  
arrived with my records the results of my friend's experiment looked random  
to him, it's only when he compared his results with my records, and that can 
only be done at the speed of light or less, did it become obvious that turning  
my polarizer and observing the results instantly changed his photons far away.   
Nevertheless this does have a practical benefit, you can use it to make a 
communication link that is absolutely secure, it's already been done, but I 
wrote about  Quantum Cryptography in another post.

I had a total crash and lost my copy of the Soundblaster OPL3 code I had
downloaded from you. Would you kindly put it back up so I can FTP it, or
send it as a MUME attachement via Email. All I need is the source code.

        Seeing as how the whole thing is totally open-source and uncensored
from the public, I wouldn't worry about the abolishment of
telecommunications coming to pass anytime soon.  Also, I think that the
American (indeed, the world) public has grown to depend upon
telecommunications.  I have no doubt in my mind that this could not feasably
happen.  All this lengthy article has to say is that a bunch of people got
up and griped about how technology is truly plaguing our society.  Chances
are, they went on to state how man is just one of thousands of species in
the world and that we have no 'right' to be greater.  In effect, I wouldn't
worry.  (Was there really any need for this response? :-))

Modern technology may be no match versus a controlled media, plus 
a gullible population.  I told people as we watched the TV reports 
of over 100 witnesses of a missile hit, that this will all be covered
up in a few weeks. Nobody believed me: " Ian, there it is right on TV, 
over a hundred witnesses! How could they possibly sweep this away ? " 
Well, they are, with NO contrary evidence, and everyone is buying it
without question -- are you?  Here's govt-media truth-control in action:

                          " O U T R A G E O U S "


        by Ian Williams Goddard

        The Associated Press (9/16/96) reports that the FBI slamed
        non-governmental  Internet reports that TWA flight 800 was 
        taken out by a missile from a  military  boat.  The  FBI's 
        chief crash investigator James Kallstrom, reportedly said, 
        ``It's just not true... It's an outrageous allegation.'' 

        How can Mr. Kallstrom be so  100%  sure ? Is he conducting 
        an investigation or a cover-up ?  Let's look at the facts:

        On July 23,  ABC News  reported that  investigators of the 
        TWA flight 800 crash had gathered  over  100  eyewitnesses, 
        including  two  active  duty  military  pilots,  who  said 
        that  flight  800  was  hit  with a flare-like object that
        streaked  toward the plane  immediately  before it blew-up.
        The  military pilots  who witnessed the object and ensuing 
        explosion called the flying object  "a missile."  Over 100 
        witnesses is  OVERWHELMING  evidence of a missile hit.

        The Washington Times (7/24) mentioned the ABC News story:

           "Several eyewitnesses, including an Air National 
           Guard pilot flying in the area when the explosion 
           occurred, have told the FBI they saw a bright, 
           flare-like object streaking toward the jumbo jet 
           seconds before it blew up. ABC News said yesterday 
           that the investigators had more then  100  eyewitness 
           accounts supporting the theory."      ^^^

        When asked at a news conference if the  flying object was 
        ascending or descending,  an  FBI spokesman said that all 
        witnesses  said it was  "ascending,"  i.e., it was rising 
        from the ocean up toward the plane, as if from a boat.
        But now this is suddenly "outrageous."  Big Lie 101.

        On July 19, the Associated Press reported that  radar had 
        picked  up what appeared to be an  object  racing  toward 
        flight 800, but then  secret gov agents stuff the report:

            "There were reports that radar detected a blip 
            merging with the jet shortly before the explosion, 
            something that could indicate a missile hit. But
            Pentagon officials, speaking on condition of 
            anonymity, said government analysts have studied 
            several radar reports of the area and the blip 
            was found to be a spurious signal."

        100+ witnesses AND radar reports of an approaching object.
        Obviously  the  initial  report  of  a  " blip "   moving 
        toward the doomed  flight came from those  who  witnessed 
        the  "blip,"  while the  follow-up came from an  official
        requesting secrecy who represents the branch of govt that 
        stands to be directly  IMPLICATED  by a missile hit. Gee, 
        you don't have to be a rocket scientist to add this up. 

        REPORTER: Over  100 witnesses saw a missile hit the plane, 
        two  witnesses  were  military  pilots, and  radar showed 
        a "blip" moving toward the plane.  Mr.  military official, 
        it sounds like this could have been  military missile hit. 

        MILITARY OFFICIAL:  No,  NO ! Those signals were spurious, 
        who can trust military equipment.  D'oh,  I mean... uh uh.
        It was those witnesses, ya, they were, uh, were on  drugs, 
        ya ya, that's it.  We're  innocent,  PLEASE  BELIEVE  ME." 

        REPORTER: OK. The military is innocent. Back to you Dan...

        Can you imagine a court case with over  100  witnesses who 
        all tell the same story, plus the "photographic"  evidence 
        of radar ( there is even a photograph  taken right  before 
        the hit that was shown on many  stations  and can be  seen 
        at-->  http://teaminfinity.com:80/800/Missile.jpg ). Would 
        such a court case be a blow out or what ? People, wake up.

A long time ago I remember reading a paragraph somewhere which suggested
that crystalline forms of water, which were stable at room temperature, had
_actually_ been formed by subjecting water to truly immense pressures. Does
anybody know any more about this? I've no idea where I read about it, I'm
afraid; probably some dubious pseudo-scientific rag.

Didn't the Manhattan project adopt a similar attitude? I seem to remember
reading that they calculated the probability of the first nuclear explosion
causing a chain reaction which would destroy the entire atmosphere. The
result was non-negligible, but they went ahead anyway. (Of course, the story
I read could have found exaggeration through the ethics of its writer.)

Sure. But there's nobody 'looking' ahead, as you originally suggested. It's
just trial and error.

It's hard to reconcile you statement about not seeing nature as an entity
with a statement that 'nature knows everything already': unless you're
assigning knowledge to a metaphor?

Besides, if 'nature' could be personified, I'd say she knows absolutely
nothing, just blindly throws dice until she finds something that works: the
great crap-shoot of evolution.

	How about self-ownership instead of SO?  As you might know, this
is the basic principle of Murray Rothbard's version of libertarianism.  As
he has shown, it logically leads to anarcho-capitalism.  However, the
principle itself is attractive to many who would not take it so far, esp.
those interested in cyrogenics, life extention, etc.

	An ideal basic principle for Extropianism.

	My basic problem with SO is that the violence, coercion, and
slaving which is the essence of the State and collectivism seems pretty
spontaneous in human behaviour.

Yes, I have heard of it. I think it was called polymeric water or
something like it. It was discovered in the first half of this century by
soviet scientists who pressured water through blocks of mica or something
similar. The result was a gel-like substance they claimed was a stable
state of water but actually it was most likely some kind of silica gel
that emerged from the mica, a classic example of premature announcement.
I think it was mentioned in Gardener's "Fads and Fallacies in the Name of
Science". 

There are of course some solid forms of water that are stable at room 
temperature, but they all require very high pressures to form (i.e. no 
spreading).

Nobody wants to sell you novel technologies because they're novel. They 
want to sell them because they sell profitably. One cannot exclude social 
engineering on free markets, orelse the markets cease to be free. One has

Status:

 TWA flight 800 was SHOT DOWN by a US NAVY AEGIS MISSILE
I received the following information via fax.  The source is a
747 Captain, but I cannot say anymore.  His sources are reportedly reliable
with inside information.  He has transmitted the information already to ABC
News. If this story is true (and the pieces do seem to fit), there is
obviously a very tight cover-up in progress which would include our
Commander in Chief....  Here is the story as it came across my fax:

"TWA flight 800 was SHOT DOWN by a US NAVY AEGIS MISSILE fired from a
guided missile ship which was in area W-105 about 30 miles from where TWA
flight 800 exploded.  W-105 is a Warning Area off the southeast cost of
Island and is used by the military for military operations including
missile firing.  It is believed that, while W-105 is a rather large area,
budget constraints have dictated that missile firings be done closer to
land so that the flight time for the P-3 monitor and tracking aircraft  can
be reduced.

Guided missile ships conduct practice firings on a regular basis and Navy
P-3 radar planes track and evaluate the missile shots with their onboard
instrumentation.  A P-3 aircraft was on a southwest heading about over the
top of TWA 800.  There was a US Air Flight coming from the Southeast
descending towards Providence, RI that had been cleared to 21,000 feet and
Air Traffic Control (ATC) had determined that there would be a conflict. As
a result of the traffic conflict, the TWA flight was restricted to 13,000
feet.  ATC then requested the US Air flight to to turn on his landing
lights.  If TWA could see his lights and identify him visually, the
controller could safely clear the TWA flight to continue his climb  The P-3
was SKIN PAINT or a non-beacon target.  (This means that his transponder
was turned OFF.

Transponders reply to ATC radar and show a well defined radar target on the
controller's scope, complete with ID and altitude.  All civilian aircraft
and airliners are required to fly with them when in controlled airspace.  A
skin paint target probably would not even be visible to the controller.)
The P-3 made NO calls to ATC.  After the explosion, he continued his flight
to the west and then called ATC and asked if they would like him to turn
around and assist with the "accident".

 You will remember that the first announcement about this accident came
from the Pentagon.  The spokesman mentioned that they were sending the Navy
to the crash site.  They immediately sent a Navy Captain, who was replaced
the very next day by a one star Admiral from Norfolk. That admiral is still
on the scene as of 8-23-96.  At least 5 Aegis destroyers are based in
Norfolk. The FBI has conducted about 3,000 eye witness interviews and the
NTSB has not been able to be a part of these interviews nor have they any
access to the contents of them.

Some of those eyewitnesses reported seeing lights. Those were probably the
landing lights of the US Air plane. The NTSB is there in name ONLY.  All
announcement made by Mr.Bob Francis say absolutely nothing and notice that
the FBI is always standing beside or behind Mr Francis and it would appear
that his job is to make sure that nothing is said that would give away "THE
BIG SECRET!" Here is a list of the Aegis Destroyers based at
Norfolk.....could one of them be the one which fired the fatal shot?  USS
Ramage, USS Arligh Burke (DDG 51), USS Barry (DDG 52), USS Stout (DDG 55),
USS Mitscher  (DDG 57) and USS Laboon (DDG 58).  USS Ramage has a crew of
22 officers and 315 enlisted personnel." That is the gist of the
story......  again he and his source wish to remain annonymous.

Questions arise...... how could they keep it quiet this long. Certainly
people in the P-3 and the Destroyer would talk?  Why keep it quiet when it
is bound to come out, and can't be covered for ever? But, remember that
this is an election year.  The Navy has had a very tough time in recent
years and is very sensitive to its reputation.  The administration has
dealt very harshly with it.  Generals and Admirals have been fired with
little notice. Sources which are very, very familiar with the 747 report
that a mechanical cause is almost impossible, especially since the data and
voice recorders give no information.  A mechanical or structural failure
would have given some warning to the pilots if only a few seconds.  The
primary cause had to be a large explosion.

The chemical traces found which are consistant with a bomb are also
consistant with the explosive compounds used in military missiles. Aegis
missiles, unlike Stinger missiles and those likely to be used by a
terrorist, are not heat seekers.  Thus, the recovery of intact engines do
not explain away an Aegis missile hit.  The airplane would not be
pressurised (at least not very much) at that low altitude.  Therefore, a
small bomb in the cabin would likely not have such immediate catastrophic
effect.  Large cargo hold bombs have all but been ruled out. The pieces
fit..... all except the reasons for the cover up.

I showed the information to a friend in England who is an ex USAF fighter
pilot, only 40 so he's reasonably current.  This was his take:


1.  Is one to presume that ABC have been warned off divulving *any* info?

2.  He questions the assumption that a small bomb in the cabin would likely
not have had such immediate effect, stating that fuel-load and impact point
of the missile would have had a major bearing.

3.  Was the planned IFF system not developed/implemented within the Aegis
Weapons System for the designator (P3) to activate?  If it was, a weapons
system fault occurred.  If not, grave human error - DDG *must* activate
prior to missile release.

4.  Why did the P3 not seek ID of TWA 800 directly?  It could still have
remained skin paint to ATC



This reply came back from Ron at Trillium, the original source:


Your Aegis story has been extremely well received.
Unfortunately that means most people I have passed it along
too are conspiracy theorists.  Hasan says he has always suspected
such, however, cites humanistic tendencies of sailors as a reason
for Navy silence not being plausible.  I would cite the possible
monetary rewards from tabloid journals.  Rick Collins, himself a
former pilot has also believed it was a missile. He cites fellow
pilots' observation and an apparent picture which a couple
had taken at a function at waters edge which contained an object
heading skyward with a firey plume.  Apparently the picture received
cursory mention on some news programs and the FBI has the originals.
Nanci is intrigued by the story and will talk it up in Russia to see
if there is any affirmation from intelligence circles.

Without discounting any of the questions you have raised (which I think
are valid), let me add a data point to this discussion. About a week
ago, I read in the L.A.Times that the captain of a commercial airplane
reported seeing a missile fly by his plane, somewhere in the Carolinas.
This was a missile testing area as well. I was quite taken aback to read
this since I would imagine that such testing would occur well out of the
way of commercial air traffic. But since it happened, I am less
surprised by the story that Nishi sent out.  In fact, in the same new
article, it was mentioned that questions were raised about the
possibility of a test missile having hit the TWA plane, but officials
denied that there were any test missiles involved in the crash.

(A)  Mr. Francis is probably correct, regarding "self-
replication."

After all, macroscale (~1-10 cm) self-replicating machines have 
already been designed, built, and successfully operated (e.g. 
Jacobson, 1958;  Morowitz, 1959;  Penrose, 1959;  references in 
NASA CP-2255, 1982).  (True, these were all very SIMPLE 
replicators.  But they DID replicate.)  Additionally, 
(nanoscale) replicating molecular systems have been designed, 
constructed, and successfully operated by chemists.  Only the 
microscale realm remains "unreplicated" by human technology.  
Since self-replication can now be done at the macro scale, we 
are now conceptually prepared to implement this function at the 
micro scale via nanotech, once our nanoscale tools become more 
refined.  So in that sense, I agree with Mr. Francis.

(B) Regarding "self-modification," Mr. Francis is almost 
certainly incorrect.  Of course, any machine can be programmed 
or designed to randomly modify itself.  (e.g., "once every 
minute, unscrew a bolt and throw it away.")  However, since 
self-modifications that degrade performance or shorten life are 
useless, I presume Mr. Francis is referring to an evolutionary 
process in which a device responds positively to challenges 
arising from its operating environment, modifying its hardware 
or software to maintain or to enhance its fitness or 
survivability in its changing environment.

To the extent such evolution is an undirected or blind process, 
many trials involving minor changes are required to find, by 
pseudo-random search, a single design change that will prove 
helpful.  Basic physical scaling laws mandate that, all else 
being equal, physical replication speed is a linear function of 
size.  Thus the smaller the replicator, the greater the number 
of trial offspring it can sire, and test for fitness, per unit 
time interval.  (This is because manipulator velocity is scale 
invariant, while travel distance decreases linearly with size.)  
Macroscale replicators (using blind trials) are far less likely 
to be able to generate enough trial offspring to stumble upon 
beneficial modifications, in any reasonable amount of time.  
Microscale replicators, on the other hand, should be able to 
generate offspring a million times faster (or more), thus are 
far more likely to randomly turn up productive modifications, 
hence to "evolve."

To the extent that such evolution is an intelligently directed 
process, microscale replicators still enjoy the same tremendous 
scaling advantage in computational speed.   Microscale 
replicators built using nanotech will use nanocomputers (e.g. 
diamondoid rods with nanometer-scale features) to design, build, 
and analyze their directed-modification offspring machines.  Per 
unit mass or per unit volume, these nanocomputers will operate 
at least a million times faster than computers built using 
macroscale tools (e.g. silicon chips with ~micron-scale 
features) that will direct the macroscale replicators.

Of course, macroscale replicators can be evolved slowly using 
macroscale computers.  (Indeed, this is called "the history of 
human technology.")  Or, nanocomputers could be used to direct 
the evolution of macroscale replicators, which will go a bit 
faster.  But clearly the theoretically fastest evolutionary 
speed will come from nanoscale computers directing nanoscale 
replicators.

Since self-modifying replicators should actually be easier to 
implement at the nanoscale than at the macroscale, macroscale 
experience with self-evolving mechanical systems is probably 
unnecessary.


II.  Infinite Regress and the Fallacy of the Substrate

This argument, as stated, has at least two fundamental flaws.

First, since self-replicating machines have already been built 
using macrotechnology (see above references), it is therefore 
already a fact that nanotechnology is NOT required to build 
replicators.  QED.  End of discussion.

Second, the author of this argument assumes that "components 
have to worry about quality control on their components."  He 
has fallen prey to what I call the "Fallacy of the Substrate."  
I shall explain.

Many commentators, whether implicitly or explicitly, assume that 
replication -- in order to qualify as "genuine self-replication" 
-- must take place in a sea of highly-disordered (if not 
maximally disordered) inputs.  This assumption is unwarranted, 
theoretically unjustifiable, and incorrect.

The most general theoretical conception of replication views 
replication as akin to a manufacturing process.  In this 
process, a stream of inputs enters the manufacturing device.  A 
different stream of outputs exits the manufacturing device.  
When the stream of outputs is specified to be identical to the 
physical structure of the manufacturing device, the 
manufacturing device is said to be "self-replicating."

Note that in this definition, there are no restrictions of any 
kind placed upon the nature of the inputs.  On the one hand, 
these inputs could consist of a 7,000 oK plasma containing equal 
numbers of atoms of all the 92 natural elements -- by some 
measures, a "perfectly random" or maximally chaotic input 
stream.  On the other hand, the input stream could consist of 
cubic-centimeter blocks of pure elements.  Or it could consist 
of prerolled bars, sheets, and wires.  Or it could consist of 
preformed gears, ratchets, levers and clips.  Or it could 
consist of more highly refined components, such as 
premanufactured motors, switches, gearboxes, and computer chips.  
A manufacturing device that accepts ANY of these input streams, 
and outputs precise physical copies of itself, is clearly self-
replicating.

During our 1980 NASA study on replicating systems, one amusing 
illustration of the Fallacy of the Substrate that we invented 
was the self-reproducing PUMA robot.  This robot is 
conceptualized as a complete mechanical device, plus a fuse that 
must be inserted into the robot to make it functional.  In this 
case, the input substrate consists of two distinct parts:  (1) a 
stream of 99.99%-complete robots, arriving on one conveyor belt, 
and (2) a stream of fuses arriving on a second conveyor belt.  
The robot combines these two streams, and the result of this 
manufacturing process is a physical duplicate of itself.  Hence, 
the robot has in fact "reproduced."  You may argue that the 
replicative act somehow seems trivial and uninspiring, but the 
act is a reproductive act, nonetheless.

Therein lies the core of the Fallacy of the Substrate:  
"Replication" can occur on any of an infinite number of input 
substrates.  Depending on its design, a particular device may be 
restricted to replication from only a very limited range of 
input substrates.  Or, it may have sufficient generality to be 
able to replicate itself from a very broad range of substrates.  
In some sense this generality is a measure of the device's 
survivability in diverse environments.  But it is clearly 
fallacious to suggest that "replication" occurs only when 
duplication of the original manufacturing device takes place 
from a highly disordered substrate.

>From a replicating systems design perspective, two primary 
questions must always be addressed:  (1) What is the anticipated 
input substrate?  (2) Does the device contain sufficient 
knowledge, energy, and physical manipulatory skills to convert 
the anticipated substrate into copies of itself?  Macroscale 
self-replicating devices that operate on a simple, well-ordered 
input substrate of ~2-5 distinct parts (and up to ~10 parts per 
device, I believe) were demonstrated in the laboratory nearly 40 
years ago.  Japanese robot-making factories use the same robots 
as they produce, inside the factory, hence these factories may 
be regarded as at least partially self-replicating.  I have no 
doubt that a specialized replicating machine using an input 
substrate of up to ~100 distinct (modularized) components (and 
~1000 total parts) could easily be built using current 
technology.  Future advances may gradually extend the generality 
of this input substrate to 10^4, 10^6, perhaps even to 10^8 
distinct parts.

Of course, the number of distinct parts is not the sole measure 
of replicative complexity.  After all, a nanodevice which, when 
deposited on another planet, can replicate itself using only the 
92 natural elements is using only 92 different "parts" (atoms).

If you remain frustrated by the above definition of replication, 
try to imagine a multidimensional volumetric "substrate space", 
with the number of different kinds of parts along one axis, the 
average descriptive complexity per part along another axis, the 
relative concentration of useful parts as a percentage of all 
parts presented on still another axis, the number of parts per 
subsystem and the number of subsystems per device on two 
additional axes, and the relative randomicity of parts 
orientation in space (jumbleness) along yet another axis.  A 
given manufacturing device capable of outputting copies of 
itself, a device which we shall call a "replicator," has some 
degree of replicative functionality that maps some irregular 
volume in this substrate space.  The fuse-sticking PUMA robot 
occupies a mere point in this space;  a human being or an amoeba 
occupies a somewhat larger volume.  A nanoreplicator able to 
make copies of itself out of raw dirt would occupy a still 
larger volume of substrate space.  We would say that a 
replicator which occupies a smaller volume of substrate space 
has lesser replicative complexity than one which occupies a 
greater volume.  But it is STILL a "replicator."

So if someone wishes to hypothesize that replicators "cannot be 
built" on some scale or another, they must be careful (1) to 
specify the input substrate they are assuming, and (2) to prove 
that the device in question is theoretically incapable of self-
replication from that particular substrate.  Using pre-made 
parts is not "cheating."  Remember:  Virtually all known 
replicators -- including human beings -- rely heavily on input 
streams consisting of "premanufactured parts" most of which 
cannot be synthesized "in house."

Because of their superior speed of operation in both thought and 
action, there is little question that microscale replicators 
constructed from nanoscale components are theoretically capable 
of far greater replicative complexity than macroscale 
replicators constructed of macroscale parts.  But replicators 
can be built at EITHER scale.


III.  Linear vs. Exponential Processes

There are two arguments advanced here:  (A) that dust particles 
can insert themselves between moving surfaces, immobilizing 
these moving surfaces and causing the machine to halt; and (B) 
that frictional abrasion from environmental dust particles 
degrades parts until these parts eventually fail.

(A)  A correct system design will take full account of all 
particles likely to be encountered in the normal operating 
environment.  Proper component design should ensure that dust 
particle diameter << typical part diameter, and that moving 
parts have sufficient compliance such that dust particles of the 
maximum anticipated size can pass through the mechanism without 
incident.  It may be necessary to enclose critical component 
systems within a controlled environment to preclude entry of 
particles large enough to jam the mechanism.  But this is a 
design specification -- an engineering choice -- and not a 
fundamental limitation of replicative systems engineering.

(B)  A process such as frictional abrasion is a LINEAR 
degenerative process.  Assuming proper design, in which dust 
particle diameter << typical part diameter, component-surface 
error caused by abrasion slowly accumulates until some critical 
threshold is surpassed, after which the device malfunctions and 
ceases to replicate.

However, the generative (replicative) process will be 
EXPONENTIAL (or at least polynomial, once you reach large 
populations where physical crowding becomes an important factor) 
if the replicators (1) produce fertile offspring and (2) have 
full access to all necessary inputs. 

Now, an exponential generative process can ALWAYS outcompete a 
linear degenerative process, given two assumptions:  (1) the 
degenerative time constant (e.g. mean time to abrasive failure 
of the replicator) ~> the generative time constant (e.g. the 
replicator's gestation + maturation period), AND (2) the number 
of fertile offspring per generation (e.g., size of the litter) 
~>1.  Assumption (1) should always be true, because a 
"replicator" that breaks down before it has given birth to even 
a single fertile offspring is a poor design hardly worthy of the 
name.  Assumption (2) should usually be true as well.  Most 
device designs I've seen involve one machine producing one or 
more offspring.  (Fertile offspring per generation can in theory 
be <1 if members of many generations cooperate in the 
construction of a single next-generation offspring -- the "it 
takes a village" scenario.)  Thus, even in the absence of simple 
strategies such as component redundancy or a component "repair 
by replacement" capability which would further enhance 
reliability, component degeneration may slow -- but should not 
halt -- the replicative cascade.

Once you have clearly specified the input substrate you will be 
working with, then parts size and the component compliance 
becomes a design decision that is completely under the control 
of the engineer.  If your input substrate contains parts that 
are likely to have a few extra layers of atoms, then your design 
must accommodate that level of positional imprecision during 
normal operations.

Almost certainly, a replicating machine may someday be built 
that has a billion parts.  However, a replicating machine can 
ALSO be built with only three parts.  (I have pictures of one 
such device in operation, in my files.)  The assumption that 
vast numbers of parts are required to build a replicator -- even 
a nanoreplicator -- are simply unwarranted.  Indeed, I fully 
expect that the first 8-bit programmable nanoscale assembler 
(e.g. of Feynman Prize fame) that is capable of self-replication 
will employ an input substrate of no more than a few dozen 
different types of parts, and will be constructed of fewer than 
1000 of these parts -- possibly MUCH fewer.  These 
premanufactured parts may be supplied to the assembler as 
outputs of some other (chemical? biotech? STM?) nanoscale 
process.


V.  The Efficient Replicator Scaling Conjecture

> So it *might* actually be possible to build a macro-based

I have formulated a conjecture ("the proof of which the margin 
is too narrow to contain") that the most efficient replicator 
will operate on a substrate consisting of parts that are 
approximately of the same scale as the parts with which it is 
itself constructed.  Hence a robot made of ~1 cm parts will 
operate most efficiently in an environment in which 1-cm parts 
(of appropriate types) are presented to it for assembly.  Such a 
robot would be less efficient if it was forced to build itself 
out of millimeter or micron-scale parts, since the robot would 
have to preassemble these smaller parts into the 1-cm parts it 
needed for the final assembly process.  Similarly, input parts 
much larger than 1 cm would have to be disassembled or milled 
down to the proper size before they could be used, also 
consuming additional time, knowledge, and physical resources -- 
thus reducing replicative efficiency.

If this conjecture is correct, then it follows that to most 
efficiently replicate from an atomic or molecular substrate, you 
would want to use atomic or molecular-scale parts -- that is, 
nanotechnology.


VI.  Lunar SRS IC Chips Are NOT Vitamin Parts!

No!  Unlike previous studies which assumed only 90-96% closure, 
our theoretical design goal for the self-replicating lunar 
factory was 100% parts and energy (but not necessarily 
information) closure.  This SPECIFICALLY included on-site chip 
manufacturing, as discussed in Section 4.4.3 of the NASA report 
and in Zachary (1981), cited in the report.  Of the original 
100-ton seed, we estimated the chipmaking facility would mass 7 
tons and would draw about 20 kW of power (NASA CP-2255, Appendix 
5F, p.293).

100% materials closure was achieved "by eliminating the need for 
many...exotic elements in the SRS design...[resulting in] the 
minimum requirements for qualitative materials closure....This 
list includes reagents necessary for the production of 
microelectronic circuitry."  (NASA CP-2255, pp. 282-283)

As I recall, `social engineering'(tm) was introduced by Karl Popper
precisely to distinguish cautious, provisional, targeted change from
large-scale, ideologically-driven or grandly coercive changes to the
socio-economic order.  Somehow in general conservative usage (at least in
Australian political discourse, and yours seems in line with that) it has
got turned around to imply the opposite.

This sounds like the recent "anti-gravity" experiments. <g>

If true (I mean the missile story) it would be terrible news for

I agree that no idea should be excluded from the free market.

What attracted me to extropianism (being fairly new here) is its optimism
about, and enthusiasm for, scientific progress.  But I am concerned about
the temptation to "cure" human stupidity on a large-scale through social
engineering.  We need both "smart" ideas and "stupid" ideas on the free
market, because sometimes brilliant solutions evolve out of what at first
seemed ... well, dumb.

Hmmm...  That's certainly not what *I* meant.  It's always going to be up
to intelligent individuals to discern the truth. I may expose the "social
sciences" as a bad idea, I may denounce them personally as a bad idea, but
I would never support banning them.

Furthermore, I don't claim that what the social sciences study are
illegitimate topics.  (This is my way of apologizing to anyone on this list
who works in the "social sciences" and may have been offended by my
remarks.)  We just need to remember that political philosophy backed by
statistics is still, at bottom, political philosophy.

Hi, I'm a newcomer to this list, unlurking to express my ignorance.

When I first saw the term 'spontaneous order' on various Extropian web pages, it
immediately evoked in me thoughts of complexity theory, emergent behavior, and
the process of evolution.  But I get the impression that among Extropians it's
generally used as a term for a certain kind of social order, or process of arriving at
a social order.  To me, the larger view of 'spontaneous order' as an expression of the 
concept that things in general (not just social things) have a potential to go from a 
chaotic state to an ordered state is what's important, not just the potential for that
to occur within social systems.

Perhaps broadening the scope of the term would help make it more appropriate
as an Extropian Principle?

Spot on James! That's exactly what I decided on as a replacement for
Spontaneous Order. It subsumes spontaneous order (so, Hara, you should miss
it too much!).

I see the components of Self-Ownership as:

        Voluntary Relationships (The Trader Principle, Free Markets,
Spontaneous Order.)

        Personal Responsibility

        Self-Esteem

        Respect for Others

        Sovereign Rationality

        Self-Direction (Getting and staying clear about our goals.
Self-discipline to achieve         goals.)

I'll be writing an essay on Self-Ownership soon, and will certainly seek
comments. Version 3.0 of the Extropian Principles will follow soon after.

Well, I get the impression that this is just the application that is of 
most interest to many extropians (or at least produces the most 
postings). Spontaneous order has some interesting implications in AI and 
medicine too... (just look at the complexity of the brain - produced by 
the interaction of a few hundred neurotrophic factors!).

  once i skimed few pages in a book, and i glanced an idea about
  big cooroporation locating their offices next to university campouses.
  never seen the book again, never seen such ideas again.
  and i dont know anything about the subject. does anyone
  know anything about using universities for profit.

Conversely, statistical inference packaged as political philosophy is
still at bottom statistical inference.  I really do think that most
people really believe whatever political philosophies they do because
of inferences they have made from what they see about how the world works.

I am a professional social scientist, and I will defend the social
sciences, *if* any of you have a concrete argument to offer against them.
So far these are just empty claims.  

Consider an analogy with "computer science".  The vast majority of
"computer experts" most people meet or see have an agenda - they are
people selling you hardware, software, programming services, systems
with computer components, etc.   These people will usually say
whatever it takes to make a sale.  But that doesn't mean there isn't a
community of people elsewhere doing careful computer research.

Similarly, most "social experts" most people see or meet are
representatives of some group with an agenda, pushing some political
position, selling some management consulting, etc.   But that doesn't
mean there isn't a community of people doing careful social research.

The Tuesday 9/17/96 Wall Street Journal "In the Lab" column reported
that virtual retinal displays (recall from Neal Stephenson's "Snow
Crash") are about 4 years away.  However, they will initially cost
between $5k and $50k. Seattle-based Microvision Inc. & the Univ. of
Washington Human Interface Technology Lab are working on this, primarily
funded by the U.S. Army, which wants to use them with ground-penetrating
radars for mine-sweeping operations.  Another big potential market at
that price are surgeons and other medical applications.  The displays
they're talking about would be superimposed on one's field of vision
(appearing to be some distance in front of one's eyes) and wouldn't
require bulky helmets. There was no mention of whether the user could
provide any feedback to the system providing the display (i.e., nothing
about whether eye movements could be used to select display options from
a menu).

I think there's a tension between what we believe through inference, and
what we want to believe.  Political philosophies usually take a long time
to play out; even afterwards there's often serious disagreement over what
happened and why.

Well, I was staking out a position.  More accurately, they are
not-yet-substantiated claims.

Robin, I suspect you would be a very formidable debating opponent.  I
accept the challenge. <g>

Actually, people doing "careful" computer research often don't agree.
(Check out the controversy over Qaulcomm's CDMA cellular telephone
technology as reported (somewhat inaccurately) in the Sept. 6, 1996 issue
of The Wall Street Journal.)  The difference is that in computer science,
you can design objective and repeatable experiments.

Most social science I have encountered focuses, by necessity, on
observation.  While experimentation is sometimes employed, it's extremely
difficult to limit the number of variables.

I'm sure there's something to what you say.  Tell me more about "careful
social research."

I'm not sure how basic your question is.  Going back to the very 
beginning, there are two references you should read:  

Conrad Schneiker, "Nanotechnology with Feynman Machines:  
Scanning Tunneling Engineering and Artificial Life."  This appears in 
*Artificial Life*, edited by Christopher Langton, page 443.  This is the 
only article I know of that gives the full history of nanotechnology, 
from a non-Drexlerian viewpoint.  

Eric Drexler, *Engines of Creation* -- the standard work that made 
nanotechnology famous.  

Now, assuming you have read these references, you want someone to 
point you in the right direction.  I'm not sure how much I can say 
about this without writing the paper for you, but here are some points to 
consider:  

1.  Make distinctions.  Instead of using a catch-all term like 
"nanotechnology," use more specific terms such as "molecular 
manufacturing" or "strong AI."  

2.  Put everything into an economic context.  When somebody claims 
that goods produced by molecular manufacturing will be free, ask:  
why are things not free now?  Many items are already produced by 
replicators that operate at the atomic level (plants and animals).  
Oranges, for example, grow on trees:  why are oranges not free?  

As Robin Hanson said in a recent post, 

> I think folks are too stuck on the notion that changes must be
> incomprehensible - you don't know what you can or can't understand
> until you try.  And you haven't really tried until you've used the
> best intellectual tools available.

And you can start with very simple tools.  

3.  Be skeptical.  Ask irreverent questions.  When Ralph Merkle says 
diamondoid material will be as cheap as potatoes, ask:  why potatoes?  
Why not silk, ivory, mahogany wood, orchids, or caviar?  Products 
made atom by atom in a replicating system may be very expensive.     

3.  Put nanotechnology into a historical context.  The economy has been 
getting more and more automated for a long time; we use more and 
more artificial materials; agriculture has given way to agribusiness; 
manufacturing is getting more and more fine-grained.  Will nanotech be 
a qualitative change, or just more of the same?  If someone claims that 
the change will be qualitative, what exactly does that claim depend on?  
In other words, what assumptions are being made?  

How does molecular manufacturing differ from agribusiness or 
forestry?  If it does become possible to make things out of diamondoid 
materials, will this change our situation in any essential way?   

4.  Calibrate your ideas.  In other words, when somebody claims that 
something will happen, look at an analogous case.  For example, strong 
AI is going to be available by 2020, according to the nanotechnologists.  
To calibrate this idea, consider how long it takes to write other kinds of 
software, such as an operating system.  Will version 8.0 of the Mac OS 
(Copland) be ready by 2020?  How can anyone say that the human mind 
will be ready to shrink-wrap in that time frame?  

5. Consider carefully the idea of the "assembler breakthrough."  
Eric Drexler describes it as follows (Engines of Creation, Chapter 5, 
pages 80-81)  --  

> At some point, full-fledged automated engineering systems will 
> pull ahead on their own.

> In parallel, molecular technology will develop and mature, aided by

This  dizzying prospect  is what gives the book its explosive quality.  
But does it make sense?  What does he mean, "without need for 
human labor"?  What would a genie machine look like?  

If a genie machine is defined as an entity that can make anything -- 
whatever it is told to make -- does a genie machine already exist?  
I would say yes:  the economy as a whole is a genie machine.  Now, 
could anything smaller than the entire economy make *anything*?  

This should be enough to point you in the right direction.

Moravec enthusiastics might want to read my recent interview of Hans in the
new issue of Rage (November 1996 issue), pages 20-21. It's titled "Is God a
Computer Nerd" (not my title).

Moravec talks about mind-as-attribution, self as mechanism, how to tell
whether we're living in a virtual reality, and the virtual recreation of
history.

[Although Rage covers techology and has some good journalism, it also has
plenty of pictures of naked women and men, so you'll find it in the rack
with other fleshmags.]

I and other folks around here have run lots of experiments with human
subjects.  I'm not sure what you mean by "objective and repeatable" or
"limit the number of variables", so I can't yet compare them to your
criteria.  It is easy to limit the number of things you vary within
your experiment.  Bad experiments often vary too few things.  And
experiments are commonly repeated to see if the same phenomena is observed.

I'll also note that many "sciences" such as astronomy and geology rely
almost entirely on observation.  Others, such as evolutionary biology,
find it very difficult to eliminate variance within the samples they
experiment on.

Anders is quite right. Spontaneous order interests us for its many
applications, including agoric computing, its evolutionary applications,
application to understanding the brain, etc., as well as its importance in
understanding economic and social coordination processes.

I summarized much of this in my essay "Order Without Orderers" back in
Extropy #7 (Spring 1991). This issue is still available. (It also includes
Simon Levy's "Neurocomputing: Self-Organization in Artificial Neural
Networks."  I will make the S.O. essay available in the back issues section
of the Extropy Institute Web site in the next couple of weeks or so.

Max More recently mentioned an interview he did with Moravec in an
upcoming issue of "Rage" magazine and I have read your review of
Moravec's 'recent' book, "Mind Age" at
http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/mindage.html; however, I don't see this
book at any of the book stores, nor do I find it at  amazon.com, which
usually has everything.

I'm very interested to read Moravec's new book, but it doesn't seem to
be available to the public yet.  Do you or anyone on the list know where
a copy can be obtained?

Last time I checked with him, there still were problems with the
publisher; maybe, Max knows more now.  My piece is not a review,
but a collection of my own thoughts on the book - I read the
manuscript two years ago.  A couple of pieces are available on the
Web.

It is such a pity that because of some stupid problems with the
publisher such a great piece is hidded from the public for years!

A few things are free now, like water from a public water fountain. Of course  
the water is not really free, it's just too cheap to be worth the bother of 
charging for it.    


                >When Ralph Merkle says diamondoid material will be as cheap                 
                >as potatoes, ask:  why potatoes? Why not silk, ivory,                
                >mahogany wood, orchids, or caviar?  Products made atom by                 
                >atom in a replicating system may be very expensive.   
                    

Silk is expensive because if the price was any lower then the demand would 
outstrip the supply. The reason silk supply is limited is because the silk 
worm is lousy at producing silk. The silk worm was not designed, it evolved 
in a mindless process, and evolution did not optimize it to produce silk, 
it optimized it to pass on silk worm genes to the next generation. The silk
worm can not reproduce itself in just any simple environment, only in a very 
specific,  very  complex one. The plants the silk worm eats were not optimized 
to produce tasty food for this bug, in fact evolution tried, not entirely 
successfully, to move in the exact opposite direction.

Potatoes are made of the same atoms as silk, and potatoes are undoubtedly more 
complex than silk, the reason silk is more expensive is pure chance. Part of 
the evolutionary strategy that potato plant genes use to reproduce themselves 
include the production of a large amount of potatoes, so they must be pretty
efficient at it, silk worm genes only need a tiny amount of silk to reproduce  
themselves. If the history of life had been slightly different it could have 
easily been the other way around, silk could have been cheap as dirt and  
potatoes a very expensive gourmet food.
                
The reason diamonds are expensive is that they don't grow on trees, and the  
reason they don't is that life is incapable of constructing the tools to make  
them from the simple carbon in CO2. Life is a nanotechnology, sort of, but 
it's a very primitive, very stupid sort of one. It's not surprising that life  
is dumb, considering that the processes that made it had no mind at all, just  
random mutation and natural selection. It's not surprising that life is crude,  
considering its basic building block is not the atom at all but something  
much larger, the amino acid, and not even all of them, only 20 out of 
thousands. Any machine life wants to make must be constructed from those 20  
amino acids, a severe limitation for even the best designer and if the 
"designer" has not a particle of intelligence, a crippling one. It's no 
wonder it took the evolution of amino acid structures almost 4 billion years  
to come up with us. I don't know how long it will take for us to develop 
Nanotechnology but I know if will be A LOT less than 4 billion years because 
people are A LOT smarter than a cosmic ray that causes a random mutation in 
some DNA.           
                                            

                >Put nanotechnology into a historical context.  
                    

I'd love to, but I don't know how. None of our previous technological 
advances improved us, they improved our tools, in the singularity we become 
our tools and that is fundamentally new. That's why it's called a 
"Singularity", there  is nothing else like it.
 
OK, if you put a gun to my head and asked me for a historic parallel I 
suppose  I'd say The Cambrian Explosion 570 million years ago. In less than 
10 million years, probably much less, nearly all the 32 phyla that make up 
life today,  and some that no longer exist, got their start. Nobody knows why 
things happened so suddenly but I think there must have been some bio chemical  
problem ( the need for efficient calcification? ) that was holding back  
progress, when nature finally solved the problem through trail and error there 
was an unprecedented explosion of creativity and experimentation. 
                     
One of the animals that evolved during this time was a dull looking little 
worm  like animal called "Pikaia". Pikaia was a chordate,  a member of our 
own phyla and the ancestor of every vertebrate animal on earth including us. 
I don't think anybody could have predicted all the mischief this critter would 
cause in the coming years. Predicting is hard, especially the future. (:>) 

This may not be a singularity but it's the best I  could come up with.     
                      

                >If a genie machine is defined as an entity that can make

                >machine already exist? I  would say yes:  the economy as a                 
                >whole is a genie machine.  
                  

People have been giving orders to that particular "genie machine" for a long 
time namely "make me rich". The results have been mixed.  It's true that even  
the poorest member of this list is fabulously wealthy compared to the average 
person of 2 centuries ago (a long time in human terms), it's also true that
even the richest member of this list is not nearly as rich as he wants to be.

                >*anything*?                  


Yes, much, much smaller.

Roughly, this is a standard SRAM, with 16 um mirrors on torsional 
hinges. Operation is electrostatic, pixel switches in about 10 us. 
Contrast: very high. Way beyond TFT. Resolution: multimegapixel. 
Lifetime: almost infinite. Simulated tests showed no broken hinges at 20 Yr 
simulated time. Now use a bright RGB (bright GaN LED for blue) LED 
flasher, and project this onto the retina. (Throw away your laser scanner, 
fast). DLP MDM will obsoletify CRT very soon, whether low-end or high-end. 
(My fingers are itching for a prototype).

Hans told me a couple of months ago that he was having a problem with the
publishing in reaching agreement on terms. I believe his publisher was
bought up by another, and they wanted different terms that he was unhappy
with. He said that if the problem wasn't resolved very soon, he would simply
publish the entire book on the Web.

In a private message, someone pointed out what appears to be an error 
in my hyperchess challenge:  

>I hereby issue a challenge to the Extropians:  two years years from now,

>place.   Be there or be square.  

To enter the hyperchess tournament, first you have to build a time machine.  
I never said this game was supposed to be easy.  

No, seriously:  I apologize for the sloppiness of my recent posts.  It just 
occurred to me that in my reply to Tom Quinn, I lost track of my numbering 
and called two different points #3.  There is really no excuse for this.  
I can only hope that the content of the post makes up for the errors of detail.  

I am disappointed by the lack of response to the hyperchess challenge.  
It's easy enough to talk about SuperIntelligence, but when you are called on 
to design one, that's a horse of a different color, hmmm?   Anyway the 
tournament will take place in 1998, with or without an Extropian team.

Thanks for posting the announcement in plenty of time for those of us who
would have wanted to attend from out of town to be able to buy
flights at a reasonable prise. These are usually available 3 weeks ahead.

Will tapes be available for sale to those who were not informed in time
to attend in person?

The worst enemy of those who now or will need medical care is the politician 
who proscribes what doctors are allowed to prescribe and research,
   with the consent of their patients.

Those who understand this are strongly encouraged to modify this to 
fit their personality, and add this to their signature file, and
organize to recover our freedom from Big Brother.

For those who wait until they are sick, it will be too late.

Those who suffer from diseases which might have been cured by fetal tissue 
research or schedule 1 drugs banned by Big Brother have the right to
hold those accountable who sat on their hands while they remained ill.



Long healthy life.

 hello alexander,

  i know almost nothing about business and acadmia, or the global
  services that will be bneficial for the whole. first i have to
   say that i realy admire the altruistic feeling of the people
   of wholsystm-group. and second i would like to mention that
   Kirby Urner have introduced the idea of global design using
   the intrenet and the latest developement which includes Java
   programing language. i feel this idea is realy great, how
   is it going to be set, and its total ramification is beyond me.
   but it seems that it can be so inclusive to  creat even
   creative zones for young people to do research and development.
   on all kind of level, you might think of it as MIT global
   lab(future_connected to wire magazine). i sugest that you
    can contact him for some ideas; not precisly what you
   are looking for, but there might be some shared ideas.

   cheers tagdi 

   p.s i think there is some spirit of connection in
       cross posting.

I volunteered for a MRI brain scan yesterday... Both anatomic and 
functional. I'm going to stream the voxel data set onto a DAT cartridge 
to toy around with at leisure. Medical image processing, especially on 
voxels is currently making giant strides forward.

Just a few impressions: you don't notice a (comparatively) low-Tesla 
field, unless you have something ferromagnetic. I've been told in 3..4 T 
research imagers you feel the induced electricity in terms of jolts/spasms. 
I've waved my hand vigorously in front of the magnet & felt absolutely 
nothing...

Concerning ferromagnetic objects: in older MRI's you felt the pull at 
your keys/wallet already at entering the tomograph room. It has become 
better, due to active shielding. If a coin escapes into the tube, 
you can usually slide it outside & then detach it. Pictures become bad if 
a coin is in the tube, though. Field's becoming inhomogenous.

Larger pieces of steel are downright dangerous. I've been told of a 
video: there a modest-sized pipe wrench experienced a 70 kg (sic) pull. 
For this particular object this meant a 10 g acceleration. You are 
lucky, if the thingy stays in the tube, usually it flies right through, 
gets deccelerated as it leaves the tube, returns & comes back sailing 
out. At you. Not recommended.

In one documented case a floor-washing machine has been yanked into the 
magnet... I shudder to think what would happen if you happened to stand 
between the magnet & the machine at that moment... Great fun. 
Squashed human sandwich.

You hear the different pulse sequences: the gradient coils experience a 
force in the strong field. Rectangular pulses sound harsh, sinus is 
downright melodic. With some training, you could probably write down the 
pulse sequence from hearing ;) . The entire scan lasted for about 2.5 h. 
It somewhat resembles an isolation tank experiment: you can't move, you 
see only the inside of the tube, hearing only extremely monotonous sounds. 
(It's pretty loud, one has to use oropax). Apart from experiencing acustic 
hallucinations, you grow really sleepy really soon.

Though UKW power is not negligeable, you don't feel warmth in a head 
scan. With body scan this is supposed to be different. On larger-Tesla 
machines some pulse sequences are locked, since they would induce 
harmful potential deltas. It's not funny if you're downright obese as 
well. Then you might feel it even in standard MRI. 

Functional MRI uses the fact that oxy/desoxy hemoglobine has different 
magnetic properties. In a motorics experiment, moving your fingers 
requires activity in the according motoric homunculus area of the cortex, 
which needs stronger blood flow, etc. Temporal resolution's bad, but 
spatial is very good. In contrast to PET, this is both cheaper & less 
hazardous (both for the environment & for you).

During the scan the entire room is full of heavy EM smog. It would 
probably roast the average microcontroller, so they use fiber optix.

For physical reasons, minimal voxel size is several microns, and then 
only for tiny specimens (insects/mice). This is called MRI microscopy.
For uploading, vitrified cerebra are best. Unless incremental in 
vivo uploading is impossible, it has to be destuctive scan time...

ciao,
'gene

P.S. Sorry for the private mails I didn't yet answer: they're in the 
processing pipeline.

You're right that you wrote the last item in that thread, 'Community redux'.
I've just gone back and reread it, and now I recall why I dismissed it out
of hand:  what you wrote can effectively be paraphrased as "nothing much
will change".  If that's your view then there's no arguing with it.

Nanotech will introduce a factor never before present in the history of
mankind:  the means to replicate THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION from elements
freely available in the environment.  If you reckon that the effect of
this will not be revolutionary then your imagination lags far behind that
of most people on these two mailing lists.  Once the means of production
can be tailored at will and replicated at the point of need, production
itself is no longer limited by capital and manpower, only by the presence
of the required feedstock and energy.  That is an utterly collosal change
to the effective limits to growth today, and is most certainly not just
an evolutionary change.

Have a ponder about the Guy Fawkes scenario or about total honeycombing
of the Earth's crust with communication, water and raw-material pipelines,
and then try to deliver your message of "no major change".  And such
things are just the start of it, easily achievable by one person alone
once quite basic nanotech is available, requiring nothing complicated
like AI/SI might entail.  Just to bring it really home, if a person can
program a nanosystem to create (say) a saltwater pipeline which extends
itself a short distance into the rock under his property, he or she can
in principle create a pipeline extending into the nearest ocean, WITHOUT
requiring any extra capital or manpower or any other resources.  Such
power in the hands of everyman completely destroys the basis of our
current economy, which is founded on the maxim that it is more or less
impossible for any single person to do anything major in a material
sense by him/herself, needing to *purchase* everything, which keeps
the economy rolling and allows governments to reel in taxes.

Your reply didn't address this basic change at all, Robin.  The only
reasonable counters that I have read are those that suggest that either
the designs of desireable items will be kept clone-proof (which I find
not at all convincing, especially since I am from the GNU software camp
and fully expect the future FNF to be a leading force in nanodesign ---
I myself intend to assist in that);  and, those that say that manufacture
will effectively become a service industry, creating bespoke designs for
people that obviously don't want to be bothered with creating everything
they need or want themselves.  I agree with the latter, although I don't
see why creating *anything* that has been made before should be any more
difficult than programming your washing machine --- the user interface
is surely the simplest thing to make joe-public-friendly.

The hard part is bootstrapping ourselves from bulk technology to the
very different world of nanotech, but once that is achieved then all
bets are off as to the shape of the planet.  The Drexlerian camp works
very hard to stay for the most part within application areas that the
status quo will not find too fantastic to believe, but the reality of
the matter is that their examples are only the beginning, and are all
exceedingly tame.  If your premise is that nanotech won't happen then
that might be something to argue, but if you accept that it will happen
yet you don't accept that the consequences will be unimaginably massive
and all-embracing then I find nothing to discuss at all:  we would be
inhabiting completely disjoint thought spaces.

Rich.

A few things are free now, like water from a public water fountain. Of course  
the water is not really free, it's just too cheap to be worth the bother of 
charging for it.

                >as potatoes, ask:  why potatoes? Why not silk, ivory,

Silk is expensive because if the price was any lower then the demand would 
outstrip the supply. The reason silk supply is limited is because the silk 
worm is lousy at producing silk. The silk worm was not designed, it evolved 
in a mindless process, and evolution did not optimize it to produce silk, 
it optimized it to pass on silk worm genes to the next generation. The silk
worm can not reproduce itself in just any simple environment, only in a very 
specific,  very  complex one. The plants the silk worm eats were not optimized 
to produce tasty food for this bug, in fact evolution tried, not entirely 
successfully, to move in the exact opposite direction.

Potatoes are made of the same atoms as silk, and potatoes are undoubtedly more 
complex than silk, the reason silk is more expensive is pure chance. Part of 
the evolutionary strategy that potato plant genes use to reproduce themselves 
include the production of a large amount of potatoes, so they must be pretty
efficient at it, silk worm genes only need a tiny amount of silk to reproduce  
themselves. If the history of life had been slightly different it could have 
easily been the other way around, silk could have been cheap as dirt and  
potatoes a very expensive gourmet food.
                
The reason diamonds are expensive is that they don't grow on trees, and the  
reason they don't is that life is incapable of constructing the tools to make  
them from the simple carbon in CO2. Life is a nanotechnology, sort of, but 
it's a very primitive, very stupid sort of one. It's not surprising that life  
is dumb, considering that the processes that made it had no mind at all, just  
random mutation and natural selection. It's not surprising that life is crude,  
considering its basic building block is not the atom at all but something  
much larger, the amino acid, and not even all of them, only 20 out of 
thousands. Any machine life wants to make must be constructed from those 20  
amino acids, a severe limitation for even the best designer and if the 
"designer" has not a particle of intelligence, a crippling one. It's no 
wonder it took the evolution of amino acid structures almost 4 billion years  
to come up with us. I don't know how long it will take for us to develop 
Nanotechnology but I know if will be A LOT less than 4 billion years because 
people are A LOT smarter than a cosmic ray that causes a random mutation in 
some DNA.           
                                            

                >Put nanotechnology into a historical context.  
                    

I'd love to, but I don't know how. None of our previous technological 
advances improved us, they improved our tools, in the singularity we become 
our tools and that is fundamentally new. That's why it's called a 
"Singularity", there  is nothing else like it.
 
OK, if you put a gun to my head and asked me for a historic parallel I 
suppose  I'd say The Cambrian Explosion 570 million years ago. In less than 
10 million years, probably much less, nearly all the 32 phyla that make up 
life today,  and some that no longer exist, got their start. Nobody knows why 
things happened so suddenly but I think there must have been some bio chemical  
problem ( the need for efficient calcification? ) that was holding back  
progress, when nature finally solved the problem through trail and error there 
was an unprecedented explosion of creativity and experimentation. 
                     
One of the animals that evolved during this time was a dull looking little 
worm  like animal called "Pikaia". Pikaia was a chordate,  a member of our 
own phyla and the ancestor of every vertebrate animal on earth including us. 
I don't think anybody could have predicted all the mischief this critter would 
cause in the coming years. Predicting is hard, especially the future. (:>) 

This may not be a singularity but it's the best I  could come up with.     
                      

                >If a genie machine is defined as an entity that can make                 
                >anything --  whatever it is told to make -- does a genie                 
                >machine already exist? I  would say yes:  the economy as a                 
                >whole is a genie machine.  
                  

People have been giving orders to that particular "genie machine" for a long 
time namely "make me rich". The results have been mixed.  It's true that even  
the poorest member of this list is fabulously wealthy compared to the average 
person of 2 centuries ago (a long time in human terms), it's also true that
even the richest member of this list is not nearly as rich as he wants to be.

Yes, much, much smaller.

Taking 5 minutes to read this text may be one of the best decisions 
you ever made!

My name is not important. What is important is what happened to me. In 
December 1994, my business went bankrupt because of the poorstate of 
the economy. My cars were repossessed and debt collectors were 
hounding me like you would not believe. I owed thousands and 
bankruptcy seemed to be my only future. My family, my reputation, my 
sanity and my life was at stake. I became very ill. On 9 January 1995, 

I saw an article in an Internet Newsgroup telling me I could make 
$50,000 within 4 weeks for an investment of only $5. I thought it was 
a huge joke! I spoke to my attorney and friends about it and they 
thought likewise.  But after three days of desperate struggle in court 
to keep from going bankrupt, I decided I had nothing to lose. My 
family and I in desperation, grasped at straws and sent $1 by email mail
to each of 5 
names and addresses specified in the article. We then placed our own 
name and address in the article and posted it in 200 other newsgroups.  

Two weeks later, I started receiving money in the mail! I could not 
believe it! Hundreds of dollars turned into thousands, and in the 4 
weeks, I received a total of $57,883. It came from all over the world.  
If you follow the 3 steps below, there is no reason whatsoever why the 
same shouldn't happen to you. This is a perfectly legitimate 
investment opportunity. You invest $5 and you receive a return on your 
investment. So does the next investor.

NOT ILLEGAL, NOT A CHAIN LETTER - PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE! 
OBVIOUSLY, IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED, THEN DON'T 
PARTICIPATE. BUT PLEASE PRINT THIS ARTICLE AND GIVE IT TO 
SOMEONE WHO MAY WISH TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. 

The procedure is very simple:

STEP 1. Write your name and address on 5 separate pieces of paper with 
the words "PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST". Fold a $1 note or 
moneyorder or bank draft in each of the pieces of paper and mail them 
to the following five addresses:

1. TOM BYRNE, P.O.Box 157A, BELMONT,WI,53510-0157 USA
2. AMY LEVIN, 947 ROBIN LA, HUNTINGDON VALLEY, PA, 19006 USA
3. ERIC TURCOTTE, 428 MOFFAT AVENUE, VERDUN, QC. H4H 1Y5     CANADA 
4. ROXANNE HOWLETT, 65 HAYWARD AVE., APT#1, ST. JOHN"S NF.,     A1C 3W6, CANADA.
5. MANAGER, 40 HELMS HILL RD., WASHINGTONVILLE, NY, 10992-2028, USA.

STEP 2. Now remove the 1st name on the list, move the other 4 names 
up(5 becomes 4, 4 becomes 3 etc) and put your name and address as 
number 5 on the list. You can do this by re-typing this article or 
simply editing and re-posting it in this or another newsgroup.

STEP 3. Post your amended article to at least 200 new groups (there are 
17,000 of them).You are now in the Mail Order Investment Business and 
you will start receiving $1 returns by mail within a week or two. The 
more newsgroups you post to, the bigger your return will be. You may 
want to rent a PostOffice Box to handle the volume of mail you are 
likely to receive. If you wish to remain anonymous, you can use a 
pseudonym such as"The Manager" or "The Investor", but make sure your 
address is correct!

NOW LET ME TELL YOU WHY THIS SYSTEM WORKS! 
Of every 200 postings I made, I received an average of 5 replies, 
YES -ONLY 5, each with a $1 bill enclosed. You make $5 for every 
200 postings WITH YOUR NAME AT NUMBER 5. Each person 
who sent you $1, now also makes let's say,only 
200 additional postings WITH YOUR NAME AT NUMBER 4, i.e. 1000 
postings. On average therefore, 50 people will send you $1 with your 
name at number 4. You make $50.Your 50 new agents make 200 posting 
each WITH YOUR NAME AT NUMBER 3or 10 000 postings - average return 500 
at $1 each is $500. They make 200 postings each WITH YOUR NAME AT 
NUMBER 2 = 100,000 postings= 5,000 returns at $1 each = $5,000.
Finally, 5,000 people make 200 postings each WITH YOUR NAME AT NUMBER 
1 and you get a return of $50,000 before you name drops off the list. 
AND THAT'S IF EVERYONE DOWN THE LINE ONLY MAKES 200 POSTINGS! Total 
income in one cycle = $55,500. From time to time, when your name is no 
longer on the list, you take the latest posting that is appearing in 
the newsgroups, SEND OUT ANOTHER $5 TO THE NAMES THAT ARE ON THE LIST, 
PUT YOUR NAME IN AT NUMBER 5 AND START POSTING AGAIN. Remember, 200 
postings is only a guideline. The more you post, the greater the 
return. Let's review the reasons why you should do this: THE ONLY COST 
FACTORS ARE 5 STAMPS, 5 ENVELOPES, AND 5 $1 BILLS. Anyone can afford 
five dollars to put into such an effortless investment with 
SPECTACULAR RETURNS.
Some people have said to me "What happens if the 
scheme is 'played out' and no one sends me any money"? Big deal! So 
you lose $5 - but what are the chances of that happening? Do you 
realize how many Internet Users there are? Do you realize how many 
times this scheme can be utilized over and over again - with 
COMPLETELY NEW people participating? There are not HUNDREDS, NOT EVEN 
THOUSANDS, BUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NEW INTERNET USERS EVERY 
MONTH! Remember, read the instructions carefully and play 
FAIRLY...that's the only way this will work. Get a printout so you can 
refer back to this article easily.Try to keep a list of everyone that 
sends you money and always keep an eye on the newsgroup postings to 
make sure everyone is playing fairly. You know where your name should 
be.

REMEMBER - HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY. ENJOY!

I've read that myself and I believe there was some sea show on TV like
SeaQuest long ago which storyline was based on that they were forced to live
underwater because they fried the atmosphere.

I haven't read that one, but the classic SF about this theme is of course
Vonnegut's "Cat's Cradle", which goes way back to '63.  The stuff is called
'ice-nine' there, but it's almost incidental to the main theme, Bokononism.
A quaintly entertaining book, which I reread every few years.

Computer science as a whole is not a science. It's mostly engineering. 

Only a tiny part of it, e.g. people involved with algorithm proving, 
complexity theory, etc. can be considered "true" scientists. This 
computer science is indistiguishable from maths.

For the record: I am not saying social sciences are worthless. Far from 
it. Yet they study extremely complex objects by less stringent methods 
than hard sciences, and hence should not be labeled by the same term.

>>Max

Here goes
FUN! FOOD! HOT TUB! CONVERSATION! DANCING! BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE! MOVIES! AMAZING
PERFECT HOST GEROME!!!

The first thing I saw after climbing up the steep  stone stairway( in the
darK) was natasha vita more dancing ( well, i could only see  a lot of hair
and a very fit figure sort of thrashing wild yet graceful to the Techno-
Ambient music- but I knew it was her anyway- . There was an enormous redwood
 deck with Extropians of many shapes and sizes lounging around on  every
imaginable form of suspended chair. There was a hot tub, with ( naked)
Extropians in it and even and outdoor shower ( I was impressed ) - shielded
from everything, studded with oaks and redwood trees and on a hill up above a
ravine, the place called "freeland' was a large and very nicely outfitted two
story  house.  I lurked, more or less, met some really interesting folks, and
enjoyed the feeling of total freedom and relaxation  - and had a great time! 
      The conversations were laid back - and went on late late into the
night, not too heavy just interesting and social...not a lot of hashing over
stuff- just enjoying each other..... and in the morning there was a great,
food oriented, coffee drenched, 'round the table ' discussion of everything
and nothing ( sound familiar?) followed by a movie called Harrison Bergerac
(spelling?) which was hysterically funny and sad as well... 
Rent it  if you havent seen it.   Cleaning up was the last thing we did
before we drove back to LA - back to the busy lives.... 


(a side note) Some folks had driven as far as New Orleans, and No Carolina -
i had the pleaseure of having Steve from No. carolina  visit us in L.A. for a
few days..  Extropians exist even in the APPALACHIAN HILLS! ( go figure..
 those memes spread far and wide, indeed!  SO there he is in that backwoods
area, reading Drexler, Vinge, Churchland  and Moravec - he was so happy to
have people to finally talk to, can you imagine??.)
I didnt get there til nighttime - so someone else has a different more
complete meta- take on it, i am sure- but it was a great, relaxed,  and
flavorful evening, with great libertarian symbolic freedom and a lot of
terrific people altogether.... 
And once again  that  Gerome was the perfect host, no kidding....

IAN: Of course the missile theory sounds like "anti-gravity" 
experiments, because, like anti-gravity, everybody knows that 
missiles could never fly across the sky, much less hit a plane 
-- why it's patently absurd.

It seems that over 100 crazy people had a spontaneous group 
hallucination in New York on the night the plane went boom.
The Washington Times (07/24/96) reported about these crazies:

        Several eyewitnesses, including an Air National 
        Guard pilot flying in the area when the explosion 
        occurred, have told the FBI they saw a bright, 
        flare-like object streaking toward the jumbo jet 
        seconds before it blew up. ABC News said yesterday 
        that the investigators had more then  100  eyewitness 
        accounts supporting the theory.       ^^^

Can you imagine that, 100 crazy conspiratorial people attacking 
the truth-meme, which is that missiles can't fly or hit planes.

What is more, there is a bad conspiratorial radar out there that 
is also a dangerous threat to the truth-meme:

      Associated Press 07/19/96

         There were reports that radar detected a blip 
         merging with the jet shortly before the explosion, 
         something that could indicate a missile hit. 

Thank the truth-meme that some secret pentagon officials stopped the
testimony of that conspiratorial radar -- the AP story continues:

         But Pentagon officials, speaking on condition of 
         anonymity, said government analysts have studied 
         several radar reports of the area and the blip 
         was found to be a spurious signal.

I am glad we can rely on our secret govt agents to stand up for 
truth when those bad "spurious" radars and witnesses get out of 
hand and threaten the truth-meme.


  >If true (I mean the missile story) it would be terrible news for

IAN: Wow, this sort of says it all: If the missile theory is true,
then the truth-meme is weak. So it's preordained that there can only 
be one variety of truth even if it's false, and that truth must be
that the a missile could never have hit TWA flight 800.

I'd say this line of reasoning is a threat to the truth. The only
"truth meme" is logical thinking. The only truth is what is.

[Pause]

Yes, and such experimentation is often limited by ethical concerns.  In a
wave-particle duality experiment, there are no moral issues hanging over
whether you block slit "A" or slit "B".  In social experiments, one is
necessarily restrained from trying all of the options.

I'm not a research scientist, and I'm sure there are others on this list
who can articulate this better than I.  By "objective," I mean that most
reasonable people would agree the experiment is fair from the outset.  By
"repeatable," I mean any disinterested party could recreate the experiment
and come up with the same results.

I'm not trying to suggest social scientists *always* have political
agendas.  I'm saying it is extremely difficult, and often impossible, to
design and implement social experiments that are as airtight as the best
experiments in the physical sciences.

>I'll also note that many "sciences" such as astronomy and geology rely

Nope, there is plenty of experimentation in astronomy and geology.  Didn't
astronomers prove that gravity can bend light waves through an experiment?
And there are many experiments one can do in geology, like mechanical
simulations, drilling through the earth's crust, etc.

But your point does make me realize that "observation" isn't the real issue
here.  "Variables" is.

In the physical sciences, you can usually test one variable at a time.  I
don't dispute your claim that often you need to vary more than one thing at
a time.  The point is you shouldn't start doing that until after you have a
firm understanding (verified through experimentation) of what happens when
you vary each thing alone.

The problem with the social sciences is that there are external forces
varying many things *all* of the time.  It's virtually impossible to
isolate any single factor.  For example, how do you design a rigorous
experiment to determine whether giving welfare to unwed, teenage mothers
will reduce, increase, or have no impact on criminal activity among their
children when they grow up?

Perhaps my example is an extreme case.  Please tell me a little about your
research.  I read your "Idea Futures" article and thought it was excellent;
I'm even thinking about how your ideas might be applied to the cellular
telephone technology wars I am participating in.

Thinking seems to be a dangerous thing.
The more I think, the more I feel confused about everything.
Now, I am trying to understand the relation between software
agents and their historical predecessors (higher liquidity
seems to be the primary difference) and also I am reading 
Mirror Worlds by David Gelernter where he suggests to create
real-time models of the various systems that would allow us
to perceive and affect the world with a much richer interface,
share representations, etc.  Should be easier to deal with
than the Real World, he says.  I would agree, except that we
had always contacted the Real World via sensors and actuators.
So will we have a model here, or extended body, or shared
consciousness?

My favorite confusion now is on what "carries" what in the world.
We all know that walls carry paint, people carry ideas,
hardware supports software that runs on it, brain supports
consciousness, etc.

Last year, Minsky on one of his lectures mentioned a red cube -
i.e. an object (cube) that has a quality (redness) to it.
With my usual habit of arguing I suggested to look at it as
a _red_ object with a quality of "cubeness" to it.  Why not?
Or just say that an object is a set of qualities/features,
and all of them are comprise it together. So if you strip
all features off, there is no object left.
Our compromise then was that shape seems to be a more persistent
feature than color, so we can call whatever is persistent an
object, and whatever isn't, feature.  Now, if you had a world
of things that would retain color but not shape, you would think
of "cubic reds".
  Now, people have ideas. Or run them, as hardware runs software.
People are persistent physical things, ideas are flexible and transient;
also, ideas depend on people.  Hmm...  Physical nature doesn't seem
to be relevant here; who says that ability to communicate to
other objects via gravity or electricity is "existentially superior"
to the ability to communicate via, e.g., http protocol?  Persistence?
Many ideas are more persistent than most people.  Dependence?
Suppose you know arithmetic and count things for living.
Does it mean that you support and carry the arithmetic, or
that arithmetic supports you and carries you through life?

When software and [successors of] nanotech gain enough control over
matter so that physical objects would be all in flux, created and
disassembled on the whim of immortal functional entities, will that
mean that software will be "running" hardware?
Will things change dramatically then?  Or we'll keep claiming that
things that we can perceive directly run things that we can't perceive
directly?  (Do I have a more direct perception of gravity than of logic?
- Not if "I" is consciousness!).  Did the debate of what carries what
ever make sense?

Did I carry these ideas to my computer, or they carried me to it?


Confused,

I agree that some kind of momentous, unprecedented event is imminent.  

Calling this a "singularity" implies that we can't understand it.  I see no 
reason to start out with that assumption.  It may well turn out that we 
can't understand it.  I am willing to accept that outcome.  Maybe it will 
be like the peak of an acid trip.  Fine, I will enjoy the roller coaster ride 
to infinity.  But for the time being, I am going to make every effort to 
understand what's going on.  I am going to try to place it into the same 
causal nexus as everything else.   My working hypothesis is that 
everything fits into the same causal nexus, and can be understood with 
the same logic.  (Logic, however, is far from a finished subject.)  

I sometimes think of what's coming as the "crystallization."   I agree 
that it will involve a proliferation of new life forms, like the Cambrian 
explosion.  -- Not just new organisms in the usual sense of the word, but 
entirely new forms of life.  Corporations, for example, are a new kind of 
living entity which didn't exist 300 years ago.  

John Clark writes

What's the difference between improving us and improving our tools?  
Aren't tools just extensions of ourselves?  All the tools I have access to 
could be thought of as my "body" in mechanical space.  They constitute 
my means of operating on the world, including my physical body.  This 
entire apparatus can be improved on many levels.  My tool-body already 
includes tools for improving my biological body -- exercise equipment, 
vitamins, drugs, chelation therapy.  My access to my cells is going to 
become more and more fine-grained in the coming decades, but I don't 
see why this is fundamentally new.  My toolkit also includes tools that 
can be used to improve my mind, as opposed to my brain -- universities, 
libraries, computers, the internet.  This apparatus will also (we hope) 
become more fine-grained, and I may be able to improve my thinking to 
unprecedented levels of clarity.  

Why is any of this unique or incomprehensible?  Isn't all this just a 
continuation of what we are already doing?  

Referring back to one of your earlier posts, on August 23 you said:

Hands and intelligence evolved together.  They will continue to 
evolve together.  So, let's make better and better tools of all kinds, 
and use them!

I said 

                >When somebody claims that goods produced by molecular

to which you replied

The fountain is a small part of a huge water system, including pipes, 
tanks, reservoirs, and in some places purification plants and aqueducts.  
All of this does cost something.  In New York City, the official policy 
for a long time was that a civilized city provides water for its people.  
There were no water meters.  In the 1960's, when the city's budget 
fell into disarray, they had second thoughts about free water, and 
investigated the possibility of charging for it.  They had to weigh the 
one-time cost of installing meters all over the city against the 
continuing cost of providing free water.  I don't know what they finally 
decided; I left the city before this issue was resolved.  

My point is that everything costs something.  This is just a natural fact, 
like friction in physics.  It isn't going to change just because 
manufacturing gets more and more fine-grained.  Physical friction may 
be reduced almost to zero at some points in the manufacturing process, 
but the main cause of economic friction is human inertia and stupidity, 
which will always be with us.  People seem to assume that we can have 
artificial intelligence without also having artificial stupidity.  I doubt it.

In general, the price of any product is what it is because if it were any 
lower then the demand would outstrip the supply (and vice versa).   

> The reason diamonds are expensive is that they don't grow on trees,  

What if they grew on trees that only grow half a mile underground in 
certain geological formations that only occur in a few places in the 
world?  

A product is expensive when it is (a) difficult to obtain and (b) 
perceived as better than the alternatives.  Silk is difficult to obtain 
because, as you say, 

> The silk worm can not reproduce itself in just any simple environment, 
> only in a very specific,  very  complex one. 
  
Exactly.   Just like orange trees.  Just like anything that grows.  
Diamond trees, if they existed, would only grow in certain environments, 
and diamonds would still cost something.  

Any organism grows in a certain optimal environment, which may or 
may not be easy to create.  Some organisms will always be easier to 
cultivate than others.  Some chemical processes will always be easier to 
set up than others.  This is a general fact that isn't going to change 
just because manufacturing becomes more fine-grained, or just because 
we learn how to create new organisms.  Some products will come from 
organisms or processes that push the envelope of what's possible, and 
these products will be expensive.  There will always be expensive 
products side by side with cheap products.   We will always have both 
designer silk shirts  that cost hundreds of dollars, and polyester shirts 
that are just as good for most purposes, selling for a few dollars.  

Assume we have molecular manufacturing, in the sense that we can 
grow (some) products out of diamondoid materials.  Nanites assemble 
them according to our specifications, like termites building an ant hill 
according to the specifications that are wired into them.  These nanites 
are going to require programming and design, just like any other 
fine-grained apparatus.   Some programmers and designers will 
do their jobs supremely well, and produce masterpieces of 
whatever they are making;  other programmers and designers will 
give less attention to their tasks, and they will produce cheaper, generic 
diamondoid products.   

The economy will continue to adjust itself so that typical 
working people can afford typical mass-market products, and 
wealthier people can afford carriage-trade products.  

Molecular manufacturing will emerge within the same capitalist 
economy that we live in now.  Factories will still be factories.  
They will require elaborate buildings and millions of dollars' worth of 
specialized equipment.  They will employ biotechnologists with rare and 
expensive skills.  Factories will still be owned by investors who want to 
get their investment back.  They will produce products for the market, 
and buy inputs from the market.  The managers will still understand the 
concept of planned obsolescence.  

In other words the advent of molecular manufacturing will merely be 
an adjustment within the existing economy.  The economy itself won't 
cease to exist.  

I wrote, 

>  Now, could anything smaller than the entire economy make   
>  *anything*?    

To which you replied 

> Yes, much, much smaller.  

A genie machine is equivalent to the economy of a large industrialized 
country.  

It is true that a genie machine could be smaller than the world economy 
(if you are willing to fudge a little and allow imports of rare minerals).  
The American economy is a genie machine, to a close approximation.  
We can produce just about everything we want, and the few exceptions 
that we have to import (VCR's and so forth) could be made in America 
if we really wanted to.  A somewhat smaller country such as Japan 
could make practically anything.  But I think that's the lower limit.  
I don't think a country as small as Taiwan or Norway could have 
an economy complex enough to make anything.  In a genie machine 
there are a hundred million jobs that need to be done.  

So far I have been talking about the size of a genie machine, where 
size is measured by complexity -- the number of jobs.  What about size 
in the sense of spatial extent?  

Suppose human beings can be miniaturized.  I don't believe this for a 
minute, but for the sake of argument let's assume it.  Suppose the entire 
population of Japan can fit into a volume the size of a beach ball, and 
all their tools, factories and infrastructure are also miniaturized to fit 
into that volume.  Assume further that they can import whatever 
materials and energy they need.  In that case, would the Japanese 
economy still be a genie machine?  

In a certain sense, I guess it would.  They could still produce an 
enormous variety of goods for their own use.  They could make 
practically "anything", at least on their own scale.  Whether they could 
produce goods that would be of use to us is another matter.  

Could the Japan that actually exists, the macroscopic Japan, produce 
something comparable in size to the Japanese islands themselves?   
What would induce them to even attempt such a thing?   

If the beach-ball Japan is going to be a genie machine from *our* 
point of view, not just from their own point of view, they would have to 
make objects comparable in size to their own beach ball -- or even 
many orders of magnitude larger, if they are literally going to make 
"anything."  A genie machine has to be able to make ships, airports,  
cities -- anything.  Asking the beach-ball Japan to make a ship would be 
like asking the actual Japan to make something the size of the earth.  

A beach-ball Japan would find some niche in the economy.  A hundred 
million tiny humans could certainly do things that couldn't be done any 
other way.  They could repair our cells.  They could (if they wanted to) 
make themselves useful in many ways.  But they wouldn't replace 
macroscopic industry.  They would be an extension of the economy 
as it presently exists, not a replacement of it.  They would be just 
another part of the genie machine, not the whole thing.

Advanced tool use requires the capacity to entrain and manipulate
extended sequences
of actions. Most pre primate tool usage only entails a few actions,
though often repeated
many times. Here we refer to many different actions. I suspect that
advanced tool use co
evolved with language.

Perhaps the great filter lies ahead. Per the Singularity, I think of how
AIs must be benevolent
and able to contain or eliminate ruthless systems (think of humans and
viruses such as ebola)
or the whole thing comes down. A truly vicious kind of grey goo may be
hard to resist indeed...

Eugene, there are a few parts of computer science that *are* real science,
ie. they employ the scientific method properly.  It's those parts of the
discipline that create complex emergent systems that are *way* beyond full
human comprehension, and that then measure them much like one would measure
the world outside in order to substantiate theories by not disproving their
hypotheses.

Operating systems clearly fall into this category, as do most large
networks and control systems.  Here there is usually an element of
interaction with the external world, which tends to increase the overall
complexity of systems because of non-determinacy and real-time constraints.

There are also systems studied by computer science that are entirely self-
contained yet also result in emergent complexity that needs to be studied
in the same way as would a physical system.  In this type, there is usually
an evolutionary element, such as in genetic algorithms, artificial life,
neural networks (when learning from a database), and so on.  Sometimes the
systems are not analytic *in practice* because the space of discourse is
too big, and sometimes the reason is that evolution is non-determistic
because of imprecision in computations or by design through concurrency.

Either way, the only way you have of knowing what's going on is observation.
I did my research in massive parallelism, a decade ago, and it became mind-
blowingly obvious (I was quite shaken to discover) that systems of thousands
of independent but interacting concurrent processes have a mind of their own
that is quite unpredictable ...  In this situation, you have to employ the
usual procedures of science if you are to get anywhere with any degree of
certainty that you are on the right track and not just hand-waving.  That
kind of computer science cannot be done as if it were purely mathematics,
even though in many other parts of the discipline you are entirely right.

Suppose the Singularity (to be concise if imprecise) is reasonably expected
somewhere between 2030 and 2080, so that people alive now have some prospect
of hanging on grimly until rejuvenative longevity is available.  Sure, you
can freeze your head, but it seems more provident to stay alive as long as
possible.  What does effect would this prospect have on your willingness to
take risks?  (This is, of course, an old sf crux.)  In particular, what does
it do to behaviors governed by `honor'?  Die for the flag, or push the other
guy forward?

This question has probably been threshed out before on this list; forgive me
if that's so.

Don't be confused.  That confusion is just a product of the poor use
of subset theory in the west, exactly the same thing that was pointed
out so well in Russell's Paradox.  If the notion of set containment is
widened to partial containment then paint carries walls just as walls
carry paint, but to different degrees within the continuous interval
between the two endpoints 0 and 1.  A subset contains its superset,
but only partially, and paradoxes and dilemmas melt away in a puff of
previously inadequate western mathematics.

For the full gen, read Bart Kosko's "Fuzzy Thinking - The New Science of
Fuzzy Logic" (ISBN 0-00-654713-3);  also, his "Neural Networks and Fuzzy
Systems" (ISBN 0-13-611435-0) is an excellent textbook.  Together, these
two are to fuzzy logic exactly as Drexler's "EoC" and "Nanosystems" are
to nanotechnology, ie. one popular and the other technical.  I recommend
them both, strongly.

It's not intended to imply that we can't understand it, only that we

Or, just as validly, everything costs nothing.  After all, when you look
at the component costs of the items underlying some "costed" enterprise,
you'll find that they in turn rely on others, and they on others, and so
on, in an infinite regress.  At the end of it all, there is nothing ...
just the time that individuals spend on doing things.  If they did not
need to pay to survive then nothing material would cost anything. :-)

[Non-tangible items may be somewhat different, debateably: eg. uniqueness.]

It's only the vicious circle created by Man himself that attributes
costs to items.  That was a very valid thing to do in a world where
time is limited to just a few decades apiece and where almost nothing
can be achieved in a material sense without involving others.  That
basis for costs disappears when everyman can create cross-continental
engineering works (as in my saltwater pipeline example) without any
outside involvement nor extra resources nor any other expense.  We'll
just have to wait and see what happens:  there is certainly quite a
major discontinuity heading our way, even without nano goo scenarios.

Right.  All prices are relative.  Don't say "effectively zero price",

This seems the simplest scenario to expect.  Things may go otherwise,
but the burden is on those who think so to explain why we should
agree.

If the filter lies ahead, that implies that we have only a 1 in 10 to
the 20 chance of begating an expanding colonization wave.  For an
extropian, a truly terrifying prospect.   If true, we should become
obsessively focused on finding and avoiding disaster scenarios.
For a list of such scenarios, see Leslie's "The End of the World".

On Thu, 19 Sep 1996, Eugene uses the dreaded phrase [less stringent

I believe that is has already been established that hard scientists 
possess little tolerance for ambiguity.  But social scientists, faced 
with studying complex processes for which they often end up 
formulating a set of interrelated hypothesis that must be proved or 
disproved within the limited confines of acceptable research 
protocols, learn to accomodate grey areas to some extent.  Does this 
indicate a less stringent methodology?  Not in my opinion.

The September 30 issue of Business Week magazine has a one-page article (page 
42) about the Tampere Anti-Gravity Device.  They confirm that the report on the 
device that was to appear in Journal of Physics-D: Applied Physics has been 
withdrawn by the authors.  The article says, however, that many scientists are 
taking very seriously the possibility that the device may be for real.

NASA, as well as other laboratories in Italy, Canada, and India to trying to 
duplicate the device.  The Business Week article says that the issue of whether 
or not the effect is real should be settled in the next few weeks.  (As far as 
scientific controversies go, that time frame may be quite optimistic.)

A million years ago a stone ax was one of our best tools, back then if you 
were lucky enough to find a freshly killed large animal it made perfect sense 
to eat and eat and stuff yourself silly, because it might be a very long time 
before you find that much food again. Today our tools are different, we have
things like refrigerators and grocery stores and it's no longer a good idea 
to eat as much food as you can shove in your face, but we have not changed so  
we do it anyway and get fat.  

Solving differential equations is not intrinsically difficult, our primitive 
computers are very good at it, lots of people, like me, would love to be able 
to solve them in their head in a few seconds, but at the time we evolved that 
ability had no survival advantage so  people are terrible at it.
                  

                >Hands and intelligence evolved together.  


Yes, that certainly seems to be true, but I'd love to know the details of why 
that is true.

Nobody is saying everything will be free. The price of the things we are  
familiar with will never be zero, but it will approach zero asymptotely.

Then diamonds would still be expensive. Obviously a Nanotechnology machine is  
of no use to us if we don't have  accesses to it.

Nanotechnology would be much less sensitive to the environment than life is, 
or anything else we're familiar with, because it's only interested in the 
types of atoms in the environment, not how those atoms are put together. 
If your business is destroying buildings so you can reuse the bricks it's 
really not important what the architectural style of those buildings was.

Of course Nanotechnology wouldn't be totally immune from the environment, 
great heat could be a problem, so would radiation if it was huge, like the 
center of a working nuclear reactor. I suppose you'd need special precautions 
if you wanted to operate in an ocean of liquid fluorine, but beyond that the 
environment is not important to Nanotechnology.

Large quantities of rare elements would still be hard to get, but I don't  
think they'd be terribly expensive because the demand would not be large. 
Not a lot of uses for Californium. By far the most important elements would  
be carbon and hydrogen and both are very common. In spite of this I basically 
agree with you, some things probably would be expensive, but those luxury 
items are things that our puny human brain could no more understand than a 
goldfish could understand a nuclear submarine.

No.  A shoddy design will not be produced, it will never get beyond the   
prototype stage. If a superior design exists it will not be easier or cheaper  
to use a crummy design.  By the way, reverse engineering would be a trivial 
task with Nanotechnology.

There is only one difference between a man (or a machine) who has skills and  
a man who does not, the pattern of atoms arranged in his brain. 
Nanotechnology is about changing the way  patterns of atoms are arranged.

If you mean there is no point in going to the trouble to make something that

good engineering.

To build something, anything, you need 2 things:

1) The ability to pick up the parts of an object and place them where you   
   want them, and do it without damaging the parts. It's difficult to move    
   individual atoms but at least you don't need to worry about damaging them,    
   unlike a conventional factory that uses complex and fragile parts. Once  
   you have mastered this admittedly difficult skill you only need one other    
   thing to make anything.

2) The information on where the parts should go. The spatial extent of the   
   object is irrelevant.


                >A genie machine has to be able to make ships, airports,                  
                >cities -- anything.  


As long as a Nanotechnology machine has access to enough raw matter and raw 
energy the size of the thing it's building is not important, it's still just 
"pick up that atom here and put it over there.

Do the math. Assuming the ball had a volume of one cubic foot and even 
assuming it took a full month (to Nanotechnology that's a very long time) for 
your beach ball to make a second beach ball, it would only take 6 years to 
make something as big as the earth.

Sorry, but none of this is likely to apply.  The bottom-level processes
of MNT may well emerge from the capitalist economy because of the great
capital investment required, but turning that capability into a usable
manufacturing system may well emerge from other places, like the ever-
growing non-commercial sector.  We may not have an FNF yet, but we will,
as the seeds are already in place.

Secondly, regardless of from where usable MNT systems will emerge, at
some point in time they *will* become public domain, and at that point
all bets are off.  Your paragraph shows quite well how today's economy
and industry in general is wholly dependent on manufacturing capability
not being freely available.  Well, that's the whole point about nanotech,
that it not only brings the cost of manufacturing down to the near-zero
limit, but much, much more importantly, it brings the cost of means of
production down to that same limit.

When that happens, all those factories which you find so essential to
mankind will lose the key reason for their existence, namely that today
people cannot avoid using them because manufacturing modern material
things requires immense resources, even if the cost of the raw materials
is peanuts.  With that basic equation being about to change, I do not
see how one can support the idea that the intertwined economic/market/
manufacturing institutions of today will remain essentially the same.

The 'official' argument is in Ayn Rand's collection of essays 'The Voice of
Reason': Peter Schwartz's 'Libertarianism: The Perversion of Liberty'

Essentially, the argument is that Libertarians are harmful to the ideas of
capitalism and individual freedom in that they advocate them while rejecting
or ignoring the underlying philosophical foundations: objective reality,
knowledge and ethics. They can therefore not logically and morally defend
personal and economic freedom, nor do they have the tools to rationally
define or resolve political issues.

I completely agree with this criticism. However, for me it does not follow
that libertarians are 'more evil than communists' - I just think that they
are mistaken in rejecting rational ethics. Objectivists' hatred seems to be
an irrational, non-objective over-reaction born out of contempt for
libertarians who 'should know better', who are 'traitors to Objectivism' and
who, in any case should have recognized Aye Rand as their leader.

OK, I'll try (fools rush in where experts fear to tread..)

Yes, strict economic theory can says that you can assign a cost to
anything.
This is almost a premise of the discipline. However, MNT is very likely
to make the cost of local production of almost anything, lower than the
transportation cost of that same item from a central site. That is, the
differentials in production efficiencies that drive the current economy
will disappear. With MNT, all I need to produce an item is the design
for the
item, and matter, and energy. This means that any individual who so
desires can
drop out of the global economy and revert to a "subsistence lifestyle"
with
material self-sufficiency. That lifestyle will be very lavish by today's
standards. I suppose that an economy in these three inputs (design info,
matter,
energy) could in principle emerge, but not in time to avoid a complete
meltdown
of the existing economy. It may appear that a trade in designs would
emerge, but
I strongly suspect that the designs needed for lavish self-sufficiency
will become
freely available. The matter will be literally dirt-cheap, and solar
energy will
suffice for a lavish lifestyle, given a very modest improvement in
collection
efficiencies based on MNT-built-and-maintained collectors. Anyone who
need more
energy can build a thermal tap, or a fusion plant.

Once MNT is available in crude form, MNT is likely to enable us to
"bootstrap"
very quickly to sophisticated MNT. At that point, there is nothing
material that
people currently need that a person cannot make. This means:
   no energy industry.
   no transportation industry (for goods.)
   no contruction industry.
   no maunfacturing industry.
   no agriculture.

The bulk of the service and information industries (banking, etc.) exist
to support
commerce, and will also be rendered unnecessary.

The above can all be accomplished using MNT to simply build items
equivalent to the
ones we already have. There is no need to take advantage of MNT's
abiltities to make
new kinds of items.

There remains the personal service portion of the economy, including
medicine. My
crystal ball is cloudier in this area. It's not clear how we'll
compensate a provider
of personal service, unless each of us becomes a provider and can pay in
kind. Clearly,
there will be very strong inducement to automate these jobs, since MNT
implies that
automation is of near-zero cost once designed. I suspect that most
"menial" service
jobs will disappear immediately: houses and clothes will be
self-cleaning and
self-repairing, and any item can be replaced (completely recycled) to
renew or
repair it. Food can be created already-cooked, on plates, on the table.

Information services, such as teaching, are another matter. A great many
people
are likely to opt to teach their own children, assuming that instruction
in the future
looks like it does today. If computer-augmented intelligence develops in
this
time-frame, prediction becomes impossible.

Direct personal services for the human  body, (medicine, etc.) are also
another matter.
MNT-based may of course help solve many of body-related problems.
Alternatively,
the difficulty of attending to a body may be an inducement to just get
rid of the
thing by switching to an MNT-built body.

I thought that I had presented the process in another portion of
my post: The SI can think so fast that on it's time-scale any possible
extra-system return is too far into the future to be useful in
comparison
to the forgone computational capability represented by the extra-system
probe's
mass. I proposed that the SI would increase its speed by several orders
of magnitude by converting its mass into a neutron star.

Unfortunately, as you say there seems to be little in the way a human or
corporation can do in the way of useful self-augmentation. I contend
that
an SI that includes a substantial computer component is very amenable to
useful self-augmentation, while people and organizations are not. The
reason:
the SI can understand itself and it can reprogram itself. I contend that
this
is fundamentally different than the process used by a human or a
corporation
atempting self-augmentation.

Nope, I didn't say missiles can't fly.  I was drawing a connection between
two sensational but similarly unsubstantiated reports.

For the record, I don't rule out the future possibility of an
"anti-gravity" machine.  I just doubt it will suddenly appear out of
nowhere.

Untold thousands have reported hearing the voice of God or seeing the face
of Jesus.  Truth-seekers must recognize situations in which wishful
thinking plays a role.

Besides, you can't believe everything you read in the newspapers or see on
TV.

The same Associated Press cites a report there was a meaningful blip *and*
an anonymous report that it was concluded to be a spurious signal.  Which
should we believe?   The conclusion it was spurious was later included in a
formal statement -- subjecting it to broader public scrutiny.

No, what you are really suggesting is a conspiracy between the entire
government and the entire media to cover up the "truth."  However, neither
of these institutions (in the U.S., at least) are as monolithic as you
imagine.  Nor is the media (despite its many faults) merely a tool of the
government.

We agree on the form of truth.  What we disagree over is your belief that
only a handful of conspiracy theorists have access to its substance.

You can bring a small number of people into a lab and run an
experiment on them, and then do it again tommorow and get similar
results.  You can also vary just one aspect of your experiment.

 Of course the new people are different, and even the same
people would be in different moods, etc.  But you're going to say you
can't do social science because of that, you'll have to dump medical
science too.  Same people, same variance, just asking different questions.

How do you run a rigorous experiment to say what any specific welfare
bill would do in any specific state?  Maybe you can't.  But that
doesn't mean you can't do other things.

The current economy is *not* driven by raw physical production economy
efficiencies.  There are also costs to retool for new products, to
invent products, to market them, etc.

If the population explodes (such as with uploads) there may not be
enough land and sunlight for everyone to do this.  Or drop outs may
not have their property rights respected if their military technology 
is far below par.

But it may be very poor compared to not dropping out.  
You and I could now go try to live as mountain men, after all.
Which isn't a bad life by historical standards (now that even mountain
men can afford guns, flashlights, etc.)

This all depends on the speed of change.  Why would it be that fast?

Why do you think an SI will understand itself any more than we
understand ourselves?  And even if it could, that doesn't mean such
understanding will lead to much improvement.

I'm not an economist, so I don't immediately convert the problem to
one of discount rate. I'll try not to mangle the concept. Basically,
I'm arguing that the discount rate is very high because the SI ability
to
employ the mass of the probe for computation is so large. the only
things
an extra-system probe can eventually contribute are 1) a retrun of
extra-system
mass, or 2) a return of extra-system information. I'm assuming that the
SI will decide that it can use the computational power represented by
the
probe's mass to produce the information locally long before the
information
can be returned fromn an extra-system source. That is, I see that one
side of the
discount ration is very large, and I don't see any equivalent large
value on
the other side of the ratio.

Basically, I don't believe that we understand the basics of human
cognition.Therefore our attempts at self-augmentation have no firm
basis.
We do, however, understand the basics of machine computation:
we can design and build more powerful computer hardware and software.
Since
we understand this basis already, I believe that an SI can also
understand it.
I believe that an SI with a computer component will be able to design
and
build ever more powerful hardware and software, thus increasing its
own capabilities. I think that this is likely to lead not just to an
improvement, but to a rapid feedback process.

This may not be self-evident, but it's certainly the case that MNT
"universal assemblers" can build most items with no input other than
matter and energy. This is efficiently done by "re-tooling" as
necessary, building tools to build tools to ultimately build the
desired article. Clearly, building a one-off item will be a lot cheaper
with MNT than without it. I believe the relative cost advantage of mass
production over local custom production will almost disappear, even
before transportation costs are considered.

Transportation, on the other hand, requires an infrastructure that
must be built and maintained at a cost in energy and matter. This
overhead must be amortized over the cost of all goods to be transported.
While it's true that MNT can revolutionize transportation, my gut
feeling is that cost of transportation will exceed the differntial cost
of local manufacture. Not very scientific, I admit, but I don't have
time to do research to settle the question. You are free to assume the
opposite, but without a working MNT example, all either of us have is
an opinion.

This atatement is not self-evident. Defend it. :-)

Note also that "retooling" is almost intrinsic to MNT manufacturing.
For many items, "inventing" and "marketing" may end up being handled
informally, the way cooks trade recipes. This is tachnically an
economic activity, but if that's all that's left, I still claim that
the existing economy can be considered to have disappeared.

This looks more like politics than economics, but you are correct:
MNT can permit a government or other group to impose any arbitrary
condition on the populace. We may have to work hard to keep this
from happening, perhaps by attempting to support the US constitution
or by forming some other governmental system or association.What
does this have to do with the effect of MNT on our current economy?

Correct, of course. However, I feel that the relative inefficiency
of "drop-out" to "mainline" lifestyle will be much smaller with MNT.
I'll spend esswentially zero time on the mechanics of living as a
MNT drop-out. As a non-MNT mountain man, I'd spend a lot of time on
making a living, I think.

Why not? What will limit the speed of adoption of MNT? what will limit
the rate of advance of MNT technology, given the obvious (to me, anyway)
feedback mechanisms by which MNT will beget better MNT?

The only limiting mechanism that I've been able to come up with is
the economic disruption itself. Not pretty. It may result in the 
need to employ the aforementioned MNT subsistence scheme.

[ Sent @0 Sep 1996 to Extropian list]

Thinking seems to be a dangerous thing.
The more I think, the more I feel confused about everything.
Now, I am trying to understand the relation between software
agents and their historical predecessors (higher liquidity
seems to be the primary difference) and also I am reading 
Mirror Worlds by David Gelernter where he suggests to create
real-time models of the various systems that would allow us
to perceive and affect the world with a much richer interface,
share representations, etc.  Should be easier to deal with
than the Real World, he says.  I would agree, except that we
had always contacted the Real World via sensors and actuators.
So will we have a model here, or extended body, or shared
consciousness?

My favorite confusion now is on what "carries" what in the world.
We all know that walls carry paint, people carry ideas,
hardware supports software that runs on it, brain supports
consciousness, etc.

Last year, Minsky on one of his lectures mentioned a red cube -
i.e. an object (cube) that has a quality (redness) to it.
With my usual habit of arguing I suggested to look at it as
a _red_ object with a quality of "cubeness" to it.  Why not?
Or just say that an object is a set of qualities/features,
and all of them are comprise it together. So if you strip
all features off, there is no object left.
Our compromise then was that shape seems to be a more persistent
feature than color, so we can call whatever is persistent an
object, and whatever isn't, feature.  Now, if you had a world
of things that would retain color but not shape, you would think
of "cubic reds".
  Now, people have ideas. Or run them, as hardware runs software.
People are persistent physical things, ideas are flexible and transient;
also, ideas depend on people.  Hmm...  Physical nature doesn't seem
to be relevant here; who says that ability to communicate to
other objects via gravity or electricity is "existentially superior"
to the ability to communicate via, e.g., http protocol?  Persistence?
Many ideas are more persistent than most people.  Dependence?
Suppose you know arithmetic and count things for living.
Does it mean that you support and carry the arithmetic, or
that arithmetic supports you and carries you through life?

When software and [successors of] nanotech gain enough control over
matter so that physical objects would be all in flux, created and
disassembled on the whim of immortal functional entities, will that
mean that software will be "running" hardware?
Will things change dramatically then?  Or we'll keep claiming that
things that we can perceive directly run things that we can't perceive
directly?  (Do I have a more direct perception of gravity than of logic?
- Not if "I" is consciousness!).  Did the debate of what carries what
ever make sense?

Did I carry these ideas to my computer, or they carried me to it?


Confused,

EXTRO-3 is getting close enough so that we have to plan for it.
The tentative dates for EXTRO-3 are now weekends of August 2-3
and August 9-10 of 1997, with a backup plan of July 26-27 weekend.
We would like to select the date so that it would not interfere
with other conferences, and be convenient for everybody.
If you know of any other events of extropian interest planned for
one of those weekends, or have personal preferences, please send me
_private_ mail at sasha1@netcom.com

Please reread the original post and my reaction.  I never said "a missile
could never have hit TWA flight 800."  I was responding to the specific
claim that Flight 800 was shot down by a *US Navy missil* and that there is
a *massive cover up* underway extending all the way up to the President.

IAN: Based on the 100+ witness and radar reports, someone shot the 
plane down with a missile. They must have used a fairly large and 
powerful missile requiring a fairly large ocean vessel to launch it. 
How does the suggestion that the Navy may have fired this missile in 
any way seem equivalent to "anti-gravity experiments"? The suggestion 
that there is such an equivalence, seems to me to be the only thing
resembling an "anti-gravity experiment."

Adding to the missile reports the fact that early reports said the 
Navy was conducting maneuvers near the crash, on what factual or logical
basis have you totally junked the Navy missile theory ?  I'd like to know, 
so that I too can discard this theory as you have. I've not seen any
rational basis stated by the FBI regarding their dismissal of this.

Project:  I'm going to dig a tunnel and lay a pipeline  (or grow a tunnel 
with a pipeline in it)  from my back yard to the Saudi Arabian oil field, 
and pump the oil out.  This would seem to be beyond the capability of 
an individual.  

But suppose I have at my command the Bechtel Corporation, IBM, 
Genentech, and Exxon.  I call the CEOs of these corporations into my 
office, and tell them:  "I am going to lay a pipeline to Saudi Arabia, 
as described in this spec."  At this point I pass out copies of the spec to 
each member of the group.  They read it attentively, then look back up 
at me.  I continue:  "Have a meeting among yourselves this afternoon 
to plan the work and assign specific tasks to each company.  Apply 
all your resources to this task, and have the pipeline completed by the 
end of next year."   They nod obediently.  

The four CEOs have the meeting, as instructed, then go back to their 
respective companies, and start organizing themselves for their new 
task.  They may have to do a certain amount of retooling and retraining, 
since in the past they have worked on other things besides tunnels.  
Bechtel and Exxon take the lead in this enterprise, since their line of 
work is the closest to laying pipe and pumping oil.  Even they have to 
do a certain amount of retooling and retraining.  The other companies 
have to completely reorient themselves.  IBM abandons all work on 
new system software, and reassigns their programmers to write software 
for the pipeline project.  They also relocate the company headquarters 
to Los Angeles.  Genentech contributes its expertise in biotechnology; 
it too has to abandon other projects to work on the pipeline.  

All the companies throw themselves into this task a hundred percent, 
and they do in fact have the pipeline completed on schedule.  

Do you see anything implausible in this scenario?  

Now, suppose there are mite-sized humans (or mite-sized robots with 
human intelligence).  There is a one-to-one correspondence between the 
mite-people and the employees of the corporations discussed above.  
They have the same capability, on their level, that IBM, Exxon, etc.  
have on our level.  They have equivalent tools, the same ability to 
acquire or invent new tools, similar computers, the same access to 
outside consultants and subcontractors, the same corporate organization, 
everything.  They are clones of IBM, Exxon, Bechtel, and Genentech.    

Let's go through the same scenario again, except this time I am not 
addressing CEOs of my own size, I am addressing mite-sized CEOs.  
I give them the same instructions as above, in the same peremptory 
tone, with the same result.  (In this case Genentech and IBM may play a 
more prominent role than they did in scenario #1.)  

Is scenario #2 more plausible than #1?   Why?  Why would a mite-sized 
Exxon take orders from me, when the actual Exxon wouldn't?  

If they were even smaller than mite-size, would that make it any more 
plausible?  

Let's define a  Genie as an entity with at-least-human intelligence and 
sensorimotor ability, who works for free.   (This is distinguished from a 
genie machine, which is defined as an entity that can make whatever 
it is told to make.  A Genie is not necessarily a genie machine, and vice 
versa.)  

Nanotechnologists assume that Genies will exist.  That's what 
distinguishes Drexlerian Nanotechnology from ordinary technology.  
Size isn't really the point here.  Drexler's "dizzying prospect" 
doesn't depend on moving atoms one by one -- that's a red herring.  
What makes the prospect dizzying is the idea that entities with 
at-least-human intelligence will do our bidding.  

Without Genies, the ability to move atoms individually is just an 
extension of present-day technology, not dizzying at all.  
Molecular manufacturing without Genies is just agribusiness.  

There are no Genies and never will be.  I'm not saying AI will never 
exist.  What I'm saying is that it doesn't matter:  any entity with 
at-least-human intelligence (artificial or not) won't work for free.  

Therefore Strong Nanotechnology will not exist.  By Strong Nanotech, 
I mean for example the scenario described by Rich Artym:

Consider the expression "program a nanosystem."  This is equivalent to 
giving orders to the CEO of Bechtel, and having him jump at your 
command.  In other words, to "program a nanosystem" is to give orders 
to a Genie.   This is not going to happen.  I'm not saying that 
nanosystems will not exist, nor that they will not be able to create 
pipelines.   I'm saying that a nanosystem (or any system) capable of 
creating a pipeline will contain many human-level intelligences, 
and they will not be at your command.   Not unless you pay them.

Wait a minute.  This is equivocation.  No major change in what?  
Our economic situation?  Of course honeycombing the earth 
would change our situation, just like the Erie Canal did, just like the 
construction of railroads did.  

But honeycombing the earth would not change the economic system 
itself.  Any such project would take place *within* the economy.  
Nor would it have any effect on the laws of economics.  
Honeycombing the earth wouldn't change the laws of economics 
any more than it would change the laws of physics.  

If you assert that Genies will exist, then that would imply a change 
in the economic system.  Genies amount to the same thing as slaves, 
and a slave-based economy does differ from a capitalist economy.  
But even postulating Genies does not change the laws of economics.  
A slave-based economy follows the same economic laws that apply 
in any other economy.

  This topic may have been discussed before and I apologize if it has been.
Normally, I would search the archives before raising a topic, but I am
unable to do so currently - indeed that is the central point of this message.

  I have been trying to read the extropian list by periodically examining
the web archive. The web interface and storage capacity are potentially
superior to my current e-mail capabilities.  There may be many people who
wish to intermittently read the archive.  Unfortunately, the archive appears
to be non-functional.  Several weeks ago the updating process stopped and
now the archived messages have disappeared.

  It is possible that the archives have been moved; however, no forwarding
information has been provided at the location that has been used previously.
Also, the pointer at the Extropy Institute web site still points to the
non-functional archive site.

  Perhaps a note could be placed at the archive indicating when it will
become operational again - or if it will become operational.  Of course, it
costs nothing to join the extropian list and I suspect the archive is a
volunteer effort so this message is not intended to be hypercritical.

  There is a core file at the location designated by the URL
http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/. Perhaps some process died.

  The web archive of the transhuman list also appears to have been
discontinued months ago, unfortunately.

  I am sending this note to the list, in part, because I am interested in
whether or not others find the web archives valuable for reading the list.

FYI

The Washington Post today says that investigators are examining whether
a missile could have passed thru the belly of TWA 800 without 
exploding.

This might lend some credence to the friendly-fire theory, since I
understand that navy practice missiles have their warhead replaced
with a telemetry package.

Hard sciences avoid study complex phenomena if they can help it. At 
least right from the start. They'd rather begin investigating the 
trivial, then the interesting before progressing to outright impossible. 
Tackling the impossible, especially before breakfast is either very 
brave, or extremely foolhardy.

Kathryn, my "less stringent" remark refers to this tolerance of grey 
areas.

I am not trying to alienate anyone in here, but a progressive laxness in 
one's thinking can grow dangerous. I'd rather keep my tools sharp than

Obviously, they were not comparing the relative likelihood of 
missiles being able to fly vs. anti-gravity devices working.  They 
were comparing the relative likelihood of our government going 
to all this trouble to cover up *this* specific accident (when we 
all know there have been accidents before, some pretty major, 
which were *not* covered up) vs. the likelihood that the 
government is funding ridiculously goofy research.  Your 
criticism of an analogy which was not the intended one does 
little to support your case.

The 'truth meme' that was referred to is not that 'missiles can't fly'.
It wasn't even that 'the government didn't do it'.  The truth meme 
that (Ira Brodsky?) referred to was the 'truth' that they *did* do it.  
(Ira's?) point was that if the government *is* covering this up, that 
means that the truth meme of their *involvement* is weak, since they 
appear to be getting away with the 'coverup'.

As to whether we can imagine 100 people being mistaken in unison,
the answer is yes.  It happens all the time.

Again, the point that was being made was that, if there *is* a 
coverup going on, then that coverup must be stronger than the 'truth' 
of what happened... *particularly* if there's all this incontravertable 
evidence lying around.  Your attack on something other than what 
was actually said does not support your case.

And is it really necessary to point out that 'reports of something that 
could indicate something' are *not* incontravertable evidence?

Again, you're attacking the idea that the 'government conspiracy' is 
what was meant by the 'truth meme', and that 'facts' are what the 
'truth meme' is triumphing over.  This is entirely backward from 
what was said.

By the way, are you now denying that radar ever yields spurious 
signals?  Is radar infallible?

Yes.  Because that would mean that the truth (missiles) is 
being defeated by the lies (coverup), since the missile story is 
*not* being widely accepted - the supposed 'coverup' is 
*winning*.

>So it's preordained that there can only

That is not anything like what (Ira?) was implying.

It certainly is.  Luckily, you are only imagining that anyone 
was suggesting that line of reasoning.

>The only
>"truth meme" is logical thinking. The only truth is what is.

Absolutely.  Unfortunately, what 'is' is not always easy to 
determine.  People, even large groups of people, have been 
known to be mistaken simultaneously.  Radar *can* give 
spurious readings.  Governments *can* conspire to keep 
their people from finding out about embarrasing plots and 
accidents.  And perfectly well-intentioned people can get 
so emotionally attached to their favorite theory that they'll 
flagrantly misrepresent anyone who disagrees with them.

I think this is bullshit. I am fairly Libertarian, and I am strongly pro 
capitalism. Maximizing individual freedom has no intrinsic value. It is 
the maximization of in toto (over population, over time) happiness which 
has value. Why? Because because because because because because. Infinite 
regress. No rational reason. As it happens, at least in my case is full 
congruency between ratio and emotion. Unless you are a freak, this is not 
a coincidence. Humans are just doing things. Some of it is random modulated, 
but most of it is an artefact of genetic or memetic history. Rational 
beings fared better in the past. We tend to be rational, being the 
descendants of survivors. Irrationality is also instrumental, as it helps 
to avoid becoming trapped in local optima. All your actions form the 
context for your co-humans, and vice versa. This defines an evolutionary 
theatre. Certain boundary conditions given, it artefacts progressively 
benign cooperation, albeit nonlinear. ALife computer runs show this. (This 
had better be true, or this universe sucks noticeably).

Darwin, the great determinant.

What is objective reality? How can I learn anything about it, but through 
my senses, and augmentary senses (gadgets), which translate things 
outside my sphere of experience into a language I can understand. 
Plato's cave. Is there an outside? That we _feel_ there is something out 
there is but the artefact of the process by which we are generated: the 
Darwinian evolution. Would we be randomly jumbled, we wouldn't be able to 
agree on anything common, because there would be no overlap. We wouldn't 
even be able to communicate the insight.

The search for objective reality resembles the quest for the Holy Grail.
With a single difference: there is no Grail. Even if it was, we wouldn't 
know, and even if we did it would make no difference.

This is very like the Achilles/Tortoise paradoxon. It is insubstantial, 
yet it had kept many men thinking about it. To no avail. So let's drop it.

Knowledge: a bag of tricks. Ethics: cooperation emergence due to 
evolution pressure. Deterministic as hell.

I dunno... Going for the right goals, but for wrong reasons? What's wrong 
with that? These objectivists are certainly not utilitarists. But they 
are certainly irrational.

Ratio has no inherent value but instrumentality. There is no value 
outside the human system. Many things are meaningless, if taken out of 
context. So is meaning. (I must be a Darwinian utilitarist nihilist 
Libertarian, or something like that).

All in all, they sound like a funny bunch. But, being an utilitarist, I 
have no problems with that ;)

I don't know what brought down TWA Flight 800.  It seems unlikely it was a
Navy missile.  But what is even more unlikely is that hundreds of people --
starting with the entire crew of a Navy destroyer and extending all the way
up to the President -- would participate in a cover-up.

Are you suggesting the Navy intentionally downed a passenger airliner?  Or
are you suggesting one individual pushed the wrong button at the wrong
time, and now hundreds of people in multiple organizations (including
absolutely everyone involved in the investigation) are desperately trying
to conceal the truth?

Sorry, I'm not ready to junk *all other* theories -- especially when this
theory is largely based on information provided by "anonymous" sources.

Not all information can be computed, if one doesn't have the right
inputs.  Furthermore, even for stuff that can be computed, it's not
clear there is some maximum computational "depth" (compute cycles over
output + input length) It would be very interesting if you could prove
that a computer has some universal minimum discount rate.  That would
be well worth publishing.  However, it seems you are a long way from
showing this.

Consider an analogy with the world economy.  We understand the basics
of this, and we can change it for the better, but this doesn't imply
an explosive improvement.  Good changes are hard to find, and each one
usually makes only a minor improvement.  It seems that, in contrast,
you imagine that there are a long series of relatively easy to find
"big wins".    If it turns out that our minds are rather badly
designed, you may be right.  But our minds may be better designed than
you think.

Signature Memetic Virus

The worst enemy of those who now or will need medical care is the politician 
who proscribes what doctors are allowed to prescribe and research,
   with the consent of their patients.

Those who understand this are strongly encouraged to modify this to 
fit their personality, and add this to their signature file, and
organize to recover our freedom from Big Brother.

For those who wait until they are sick, it will be too late.

Those who suffer from diseases which might have been cured by fetal tissue 
research or schedule 1 drugs banned by Big Brother have the right to
hold those accountable who sat on their hands while they remained ill.



Long healthy life.

I don't want to assume your case or the opposite.  What I want is for
people who speculate on these things to acknowledge the uncertainties
up front, rather than at the end of a long conversation.  I see way
too many baldface claims of the form "with nanotech, X will happen".

I'm not speculating.   Production, including labor to run it, only
takes about 15% of US GDP (I think).  Standard econ statistic.

I think you are mixing timescales.  Eventually, good public domain
designs may become widespread.  But by then lots of other stuff may
change too, including an upload population explosion.  And the private
designs may be far superior, and so worth paying a premium for.

You are talking about pretty advanced designs, and so not about early
nanotech.  You need intelligent machines to make your life that easy.

Of course there are feedback mechanisms.  But that doesn't imply fast 
change, only change at some speed.   Imagining, designing, testing,
tuning, marketing, etc. of designs all takes time and intelligence.
And make no mistake - nanotech design is HARD.  These are very complex
machines that are imagined.

Eugene, I appreciate your sentiments, but I really don't think this 
stance makes any more sense to me than the objectivists' stance. 
Maximizing happiness sounds like maximizing complexity to me; an effort 
to maximize something that we have *no* clue how to *measure* is just a 
metaphor, and exactly as misleading as some of the metaphors that the 
Objectivists have recourse to.

(If anyone figures out how to measure these things, or how to measure 
life or extropy for that matter, please let me know.)

Now, this I also find curious because Darwinian evolution is in itself 
our best argument for believing in objective reality. Darwinian evolution 
is the explanation that each of us has recourse to when accounting for 
how our individual minds came into existence. Of course there is an 
outside; if there weren't, then our own existence as individuals would be 
a puzzling lacuna in the explanatory structure of our thought. If there 
weren't an outside, we'd be able to explain all our percepts in terms of 
our own activity, but we would lack any explanation for our own activity.

The definition that I am currently experimenting with: objective 
reality is that part of reality which is the way it is independently of 
the influence of any individual person's mind. By a strong construction 
of this definition, only offplanet things are "objective reality" by now. 
Certainly most of the objects surrounding you, the monitor you are 
reading, etc, are not independent of the causal influence of mind and 
thought. One might say that technology is the admixture of subjective 
reality (thought and feeling) with objective reality (that which is 
independent of thought and feeling). Some people seem to think that what 
we are all trying to do here is to bring subjective reality into thorough 
admixture with the rest of the poor dead "objective reality" universe.

However, I must insist that I still do not think the objective/subjective 
dichotomy is a very useful one philosophically. It's a good thing to get 
exhausted thinking about, if you need that kind of exercise, but it tells 
us practically nothing about what we ought to be doing, and isn't that 
the point?

So I suppose I'm actually agreeing with Eugene. He seems to think that 
there is no point to elaborating the objective/subjective boundary, and 
I'm inclined to agree with him. But to deny the existence of this 
boundary, or to deny the existence of that objective reality that 
explains our individual existences just closes up the minds of most 
people who might otherwise have been listening to you.

> Knowledge: a bag of tricks. Ethics: cooperation emergence due to

Determinism/indeterminism is another one of these questions that I don't 
like to see my friends taking sides on. This is an open question! It may 
be decades, centuries, or thousands of years before we have an answer to 
this question (and I'd be willing to settle for a proof that an "answer" 
is impossible), but it is certainly an open question right now.

How could a computer fully predict the future course of its own 
computation in a manner that we could usefully distinguish from its mere 
carrying out of that computation? It could not. If I could prove that it 
could not, then I would have proved that the determinism/indeterminism 
question is a permanently open one, at least to the satisfaction of those 
few people who think that human beings are a kind of computer. I suspect 
Eugene is one of them. Me, I like to keep an open mind, although it gets 
harder every year.

In the meantime, I'll be looking into more Popper. He was obviously 
fascinated by this question, and I haven't read everything he had to say 
about it yet.

Utilitarianism is irrational too. Most of the people that "utilitarian
libertarians" look to for guidance in difficult political questions (I
have in mind David Friedman here) deny that they are utilitarians, and for
damn good reason: David Friedman is *not* a utilitarian, and neither am I.
Unless "utilitarian" suddenly means something utterly different from the
very clear technical meaning that was established at the climax of
utilitarian thought in late nineteenth-century Britain.  Frankly, of late
I like Hayek's thinking best, and he's certainly no utilitarian either.
Nor is he an objectivist, though I think Rand approved of him. If
objectivists want to criticize libertarians, that's okay with me (though I
really wonder about their motivation), but if they seek to criticize
libertarians on the grounds that libertarians are utilitarians, then they
are attacking straw men... a time-honored Objectivist recreation, I'm
afraid. 

I suspect what makes them *really* nervous is that so many libertarians
are vague Taoists or Discordians who, while continuing to keep their
intellectual tools for thinking about philosophy sharp, have utterly
abandoned any and all philosophical *commitments*. And who feel happier
that way. And whose valuable political commitments aren't even slightly
harmed by such lack of philosophical commitment. But most seriously
committed Objectivists I've known don't even know how to begin arguing
against this stance by any means other than the ad hominem. I would be
very interested in seeing some clear, calm, rational arguments against
this stance. 

(I'd also be interested in seeing a solid refutation of Hayek, too, but 
I'm not getting my hopes up or anything.)

That may be the case -- it would be more convincing if you provided some

And would you claim the same is true for most experiments in sociology and

Um, Albert Einstein predicted what was later confirmed:

"Since the fixed stars in the parts of the sky near the sun become visible
during a total eclipse, it is possible to check this theoretical conclusion
[a ray of light coming from a fixed star and just grazing the border of the
sun will be deflected by 0.83 seconds of an arc] by experiment."

Your first statement may be true for psychology and microeconomics.  But is
it true for sociology, political science, and macroeconomics?

As to your second statement, it is certainly true *you* can vary just one
aspect of your experiment.  What I am doubting is whether you can reliably
prevent *other* aspects from being varied.

Well, medicine is really a mixture of art and science.  Some medical
research is based purely on statistical correlation, while some is based on
cause and effect.  But note that most medical research relies on objective
measurements (e.g., size of a tumor, number of white blood cells per CC,
etc.).  I would think (but I could be wrong) most social science
experiments on human subjects conducted in a lab rely primarily on what the
subjects say.

about Innovations: business and academia and Automated Collaborative
Filtering (ACF) agents for the Internet.

Sorry, I don't have anything about business & academia collaborations,
although I did notice that Firefly was mentioned, among only about 3
other companies working on ACF agents, in a recent (I think)
Computerworld article.

However, over the weekend I happened upon an article in my cache from a
2/95 Communications of the ACM Technical Correspondence column "Remark
About Self-Stabilizing Systems" by Xavier Debest of Hochheim, Germany
that might be interesting for your development efforts.

Debest uses a simple example of instructing children (or robots) to form
a circle:

"the quality (i.e., persistence) of the result directly depends on the
sameness of the algorithm (or at least its goal) by all components ...
these results [how to achieve stability with autonomous agents] apply to
any system built from a significant number of components which are
moving and evolving independently from one another, but which are
cooperating or competing together to achieve some common goals ..."

"In an environment where software applications are growing more and more
distributed, where the end user gets more and more responsibility, and
where the duration of the technological cycles is shrinking ... it is
futile to try and enforce rigid development rules from the top ..."

"In regard to the development of application software, the lessons
learned from these experiments could be translated as follows: 1. Don't
overspecify ... 2. Decrease the planning level of long-term activities
... 3. Introduce a dynamic component in the planning of big projects ...
4. Implement 'bottom up' from the existing upwards ... 5. Accept
diversity; heterogeneity may be an asset ... 6. Use a goal (object-)
oriented decomposition methodology."

This is pretty-much accepted practice among software developers today,
so it may not be all that useful.  Still, this seems to be useful advice
for other types of futurists on this list as well.

By the way, John Holland's recent book on complex adaptive systems, "The
Hidden Order" is excellent if you haven't read it.

******************
Here's something else I found in my old notes that might be relevant or
at least interesting for ACF and the list in general.

11/02/94. MENTALITY MODES. In the Nov'94 Communications of the ACM,
David Canfield Smith, developer of KidSim at Apple (a graphical system
for programming by demonstration), responds to a letter criticizing his
team for emphasizing visual interfaces to the detriment of language
skills. The letter writer claims, "languages are built from words, not
pictures. Admittedly, some major languages are written in picture form
but the rest of the race considers that to be a severe disadvantage."
Canfield says the letter "raises a valid question: do people think in
images?" as opposed to words. Canfield cites Rudolf Arnheim's "landmark"
1971 book, "Visual Thinking", which argues that words are primarily
useful for (1) their ability to name and quickly distinguish similar
objects, and (2) their adverbial and adjectivial quantification
properties; in short, for helping to distinguish differences. But, for
creative thinking and synthesis, visual imaging is more powerful.

Canfield cites Albert Einstein, who described his mode of thought in a
1945 survey ("The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field" by
Jaques Hadamard) as follows: "The words of the language [digital state
summaries] ... do not seem to play any role in my mechanism of thought.
The psychical entities which seem to serve as elements in thought are
certain signs and more or less clear images which can be 'voluntarily'
reproduced and combined ... Conventional words or other signs have to be
sought for laboriously only in a secondary stage."

Canfield goes on to note: "The educational psychologist Jerome Brunner
argues that people develop three mentalities or ways of thinking, which
he labels enactive, iconic and symbolic." Canfield quotes from Brunner's
1966 book, "Toward a Theory of Instruction": "Any domain of knowledge
... can be represented in three ways: by a set of actions appropriate
for achieving a certain result (enactive representation); by a set of
summary images or graphics that stand for the concept without defining
it fully (iconic representation); and by a set of symbolic or logical
propositions drawn from a symbolic system that is governed by rules or
laws for forming and transforming propositions (symbolic
representation)."

Recent object-oriented analysis methodologies seem to recognize this by
defining dynamic, object and functional models for any system.

In general, it seems to me that the more detailed one's knowledge of the
world becomes, the more structured (and symbolic) it must be, with more
categories. In order to successfully assimilate a greater variety of
information, one's knowledge base is forced to take on a highly
normalized relational structure, as opposed to the more hierarchical or,
at a lower level yet, object-oriented knowledge bases of those less
educated. But, while facilitating analysis and enabling a broader range
of knowledge to be stored, the relational model imposes penalties when
it comes to seeing trends and decision making because there are many
more fragmented knowledge sources that must be joined to produce a
useful synthesis.  Organizations are finding that 'multidimensional'
databases, sitting 'on top' of the broader relational database, which
"rely on a hierarchical structure, with sets of data feeding into higher
levels of summary" are necessary for facilitating complex, ad hoc
queries and spotting trends.

In conclusion, it seems that mental development begins (in the infant)
at the enactive level, proceeds to develop iconic representations of
objects and actions (the toddling stage); and 'finally', acquires a
detailed symbology or language for more precise and complex description
of the world (the student stage). BUT, once the detailed language is in
place for continual knowledge gathering, the mind then needs to work
'backward': First, it must build up or extract new icons to represent
more abstract, compound subjects; and then, it must simulate a
cyberspace where these new icons can interact in an enactive manner.
Most of us are able to extract new icons to various extents. However,
the ability to simulate or visualize a higher level world for these new
icons, like Einstein was able to do, is a much rarer skill, one that can
often be inhibitted by the formal rules and constraints of the language
we have previously worked so hard to acquire. Still, it must be
recognized that each mode of thought has its advantages and
disadvantages and all three must be integrated in order to form a
complete and coherent 'picture'.

[On 9/17/96 Eugene Leitl responded:]
"One common view of Darwinian evolution is population drift on a
multidimensional fitness landscape ... in a certain sense one can speak
of a gestalt ... the Darwinian evolution leaves a stamp of purposeful
design on its products."

Eugene is probably speaking of the work of Stuart Kaufmann, among
others. Research into the processes of evolution also involves: cellular
automata simulations (Stephen Wolfram: "cellular automaton evolution
concentrates the probabilities for particular configurations, thereby
reducing entropy. This phenomenon allows for the possibility of
self-organization by enhancing the probabilities of organized
configurations and suppressing disorganized configurations"); genetic
algorithms in complex adaptive systems (where there's a little more
going on than simply natural selection and mutation - See John Holland's
recent book "Hidden Order".)

Though I haven't studied it, there is also Robert Rosen's work.  He is a
mathematical biophysicist and the author of "Life Itself: A
Comprehensive Inquiry into the Nature, Origin, and Fabrication of Life"
(1991, check amazon.com).  I am only vaguely familiar with Rosen through
Paul Davies' 1988 classic, "The Cosmic Blueprint", where Rosen is cited
as saying (ch.11):

"far from being universal, the conceptual foundation of what we
presently call theoretical physics is still very special; indeed, far
too much so to accommodate organic phenomena (and much else besides)....
In particular, complex systems may contain subsystems which act as
predictive models of themselves and/or their environments, whose
predictions regarding future behaviors can be used for modulation of
present change of state.  Systems of this type act in truly anticipatory
fashion, and possess novel properties."

Davies also points out that "Rosen explicitly introduces the idea that I
have called software laws ... the quantities that change will be
informational in nature."  Davies then goes on to describe "wilder
ideas", like synchronicity, or nonlocality, and Rupert Sheldrake's
morphogenetic fields.  That's too big a subject to go into here
(although I do have a review of F.David Peat's 1987 book "Synchronicity"
that could be posted if there was any interest).

The implications of these latest theories of evolution & physics take us
far beyond the simplistic entropy and heat death scenarios of
traditional physics (note that Rosen is explicitly saying that complex
adaptive systems cannot be modeled as Markov processes, which is a basic
assumption in Frank Tipler's "Physics of Immortality", for example) with
its study of 'closed' systems to explain how, as in John Holland's
recent title, "a hidden order" (Maxwell's immortal demon, at last
perhaps?) emerges from evolution, not only in living systems, but also
in many of those that we currently regard as non-living.  Taken to one
extreme, these cellular automaton theories seem to indicate that
material objects are *just* the 'pixels' on the 'display screen' of what
Rudy Rucker has called "an incompressible computation by a fractal
cellular automaton of inconceivable dimensions," that is, our universe.

Some recent posts have claimed that the universe is compressible because
it contains so much space, ignoring that this 'space' is far from empty,
being filled with sundry species of cosmic rays and 'vital' dust
(archives of the universe?)

"When software and nanotech gain enough control over matter so that

This could, in theory, already be what's going on.  As Sasha asks, "Did
the debate of what carries what ever make sense?"  Minsky doesn't seem
to 'get this' (based on Sasha's discussion), but perhaps Moravec does. 
For example, at the end of his Extropy #10 "Pigs in Cyberspace" article
Moravec says: "The very moment we are now experiencing may actually be
(almost certainly is) such a distributed mental event [a virtual
recreation by someone else?], and most likely never happened
physically."

This is a pretty radical point of view, which could imply that we're
just sort of 'dumb radios', ecstatically frying our brain circuits and
unzipping our genes, pretty-much oblivious to the programs that are
currently being broadcast thorugh us by higher-level distributed
intelligences?  If this is the case, then Moravec's earlier statement in
the same essay, where he assumes that "only a fraction of existing
matter and space is doing interesting work, [while] in a well-developed
cyberspace every bit will be part of a relevant computation or storing a
useful datum," may be a bit premature.  We ignore the  incompleteness of
our present physical theories at our peril.

Indeed, I'm worried about the attitude toward evolution expressed by
John K. Clark and others.

[On 9/20/96 John K. Clark wrote (The Singularity and Nanotechnology:]
"Life is a nanotechnology, sort of, but it's a very primitive, very

that the processes that made it had no mind at all, just random mutation
and natural selection."

In remedying this, Dr. Rich Artym also looks forward to a singularity
provided by nanotechnology "where everything costs nothing ... when
everyman can create cross-continental engineering works."  Even if
nanotech can do everything we want, there's still a limited geospace, at
least here on Earth, that wouldn't allow  billions of 'everymen' to
build their own cross-continental tinker toys without running into each
other and dealing with various economic tradeoffs.  As for Rich's "Guy
Fawkes scenario [of] honeycombing the Earth's crust with communication,
water and raw materials pipelines", this *already exists*.  It's called
acquifiers (filled with lots of living organisms), mineral deposits,
tectonic fault lines, etc.  Yes, I know you're talking about something
more *sophisticated*, my point is that there are potential 'nanites'
already living there, we just don't control them (yet :).

It's this "pave it over" rather than "learn to use it" attitude that
worries me.

"What's the difference between improving us and improving our tools?
Aren't tools just extensions of ourselves?" asks Lyle Burkhead in his
9/21/96 post on why "molecular engineering will merely be an adjustment

expected by Dr. Rich Artym and John K. Clark.  Robin Hanson agrees that
this natural, market transition "seems the simplest scenario to expect."
 Hara Ra, on the other hand (9/21/96), worries that "perhaps the great
filter lies ahead ... A truly viscious grey goo may be hard to resist
indeed..."

A grey goo, I would suggest, that is driven by this "pave it over"
attitude, the opposite extreme of the "100% natural" meme by saying that
everything 'natural' is 'stupid' and needs to be reoptimized for the use
of (trans)humans or SIs, 'primitive' life be damned.  This is especially
dangerous when combined with the attitude that nanotech is going to be
"as simple as programming a washing machine."

[On 9/18/96 Sarah Marr wrote:]
"[With nature] There's nobody looking ahead ... it's just trial and
error."

There's a valid concern expressed here about not personifying nature,
but that doesn't mean we're left only with basic mechanical physical
laws to describe things.  As I hope the quotes from Wolfram and Rosen
illustrate, there are ways for natural systems to look ahead (unless you
just wash your hands and say there's going to be a singularity), and I'm
not just talking about human systems here.  To assume that only human
systems can look ahead (yes, we may be the best at it, but is it a
qualitative difference from other forms of life?) is to maintain the
false dichotomy between man and nature that David Musick originally
tried to debunk when he started this thread.

Given my predilection for dynamic optimism, somehow I never thought I
might end up agreeing with Robin Hanson's charge that if we assume that
the great filter is in the future "we should become obsessively focussed
on finding and avoiding disaster scenarios".

I'm always wary of conspiracy theories, of whatever flavour. But I think the
main reason for that is that I'm not aware of any which have subsequently
been proven correct. So a question for Ian, I suppose:

Can you give examples of conspiracy theories which have turned out true?

This is a question without overtones; that is, I'm not implying there aren't
any, I just don't know of any.

Thought You all might like this Info
---------------------

Your name, social security number, current address, previous addresses,
mother's maiden name, birth date and other personal information are now
available to anyone with a credit card through a new Lexis database 
called
P-Trax.  As I am sure you are aware, this information could be used to
commit credit card fraud or otherwise allow someone else to use your 
identity.

You can have your name and information removed from this list by making 
a
telephone request.  Call (800)543-6862, select option 4 and then option 
3
("all other questions") and tell the representative answering that you 
wish
to remove your name from the P-trax database.  You may also send a fax 
to
(513) 865-1930, or physical mail to LEXIS-NEXIS / P.O. Box 933 / 
Dayton,
Ohio 45401-0933.  Sending physical mail to confirm your name has been 
removed is always a good idea.

As word of the existence of this database has spread on the net, 
Lexis-Nexis
has been inundated with calls, and has set up a special set of 
operators to
handle the volume.  In addition, Andrew Bleh (rhymes with "Play") is a
manager responsible for this product, and is the person to whom 
complaints
about the service could be directed.  He can be reached at the above 
800
number.  Ask for extension 3385.  According to Lexis, the manager
responsible is Bill Fister at extension 1364.

The representative will need your name and social security number to 
remove you from the list.  I suggest that we inundate these people with 

requests to remove our info from the list and forward this e-mail to 
everyone we know.

LATER, THIS APPEARED:

They are no longer processing request by phone.  All must be sent in
writing or FAXed to a number they'll provide you (sorry, I didn't
write it down, figuring I'd just use the smail-mail route).

Just thought I'd try to save anyone else fighting through the busy
signals.

 ... NEXT,THIS ARRIVED:

In other words, they want your address so that they can say they've 
removed
it. Nice ploy. It could net the addresses of a lot of folks who are NOT 
in
their database. (Come to think of it, would it be too far out to 
suggest
that a government agency might be looking at the removal requests for 
just
this reason?)

I don't know how to do this other than have you read some of the

This isn't an "experiment" in the sense that you've been using -
control over variables.  They only looked.  They didn't go move the
sun around or anything.  The closest you get is using signals from
spacecraft, where you control where the spacecraft goes.  That is a
small fraction of astronomy (though a large fraction of planetary
astronomy).

First, what subject say *is* objectively measurable.
Second, Most econ and polisci experiments rely on what people do, not
what they say.

My dear Eugene, I do not equate tolerance of grey areas with mental 
laziness.

Robin,

I think you're drawing a tighter line around what counts as an
experiment than you intended.

They can move telescopes around, make predictions for other celestial
objects and verify them, do the observations from spacecraft or
aircraft as well as ground-based observatories, etc.  This seems to be
fully as controllable an experiment as you need to become convinced of
the predictive value of Einstein's conjecture.

If there is any sensible distinction between observation and
experiment, it is in one's degree of control over a system.  Observers
look, while experimenters change things (and look).  Of course
observers can look at things from different angles, at different
times, at different frequencies, etc.  And they can choose what to
focus attention on.  But if obervation vs. experiment means anything,
this type of control does not imply its an experiment.

I say:
OK, so we appear to have the distinction between disciplines that
1) observe-(model-)predict,
and 
2) observe-(model-)make_a_change_in_what's_observed-predict, 
correct?

Do I understand Robin to be saying that category (2) is an 
experimental discipline, and category (1) is not?

Are they both justifiably called "science"?

What if one _tries_ to make a change on what one is observing, and 
discovers that no different result is observed?  Were you not really 
conducting an experiment? Example: toggling the power switch on an 
appliance which is unplugged.

Robin Hanson and I are discussing roughly this same idea in another
thread. the essence of my argument is that, while the "laws of
economics" don't  change, their applicability may. In particular,
economics depends on the concept of a transaction. the parties to the
transaction must decide to make a trade. The desision to trade depends
on the relative diverence in utility of the goods (or whatever) being
exchanged to the parties. If neither party hase somethoing the other
wants, then there is no trade and no economic activity. (Sorry for the
kindergarten-level explanation. I'm not an economist, so I need to
explain my assumptions since they may be wrong.)

With MNT, it will be a lot easier for an individual to produce an
item than it is now. This means that an individual is less likely to
trade for the item. An individual will be able to produce essentially
everything needed for a lavish lifestyle, with none of the costs
associated with trade. This will reduce the amount of trade drastically.
Essentially, when the cost of individual manufacture
drops below the costs (hassle, time, and transportation) associated
with trade, trade will cease.

It's quite possible that a new  econoimy will develop based on a new
set of scacity, of matter, energy, or design. However, MNT has
the potential to develop very rapidly, destroyingthe existing
economy before the new one develops.

As a parent with two school-age children (showing my age), I find this
quote disturbingly familiar.  The idea there are no black and white facts
-- or that facts just clutter your mind -- is extremely popular these days
among educationists.

The world is filled with black and white facts.  They really are facts, and
they really are 100% true.  To deny this is a sign of mental laziness,
because facts must be studied, remembered, and understood.  Saying
everything falls into a grey area saves yourself a lot of work and makes it
impossible for anyone to test your knowledge -- because there is nothing to
pin down.

Here in the People's Republic of Wilmette (Illinois) we constantly hear
about the evils of "rigid facts" and "rote memorization" from public school
teachers.  Meanwhile, our kids are not being taught to spell, they are not
being taught basic math tables ...and business at Sylvan Learning Centers
is booming.  Meanwhile, our teachers claim they are teaching our children
"how to think" -- not just filling their minds with contextless
information.  But from what I have seen, "how to think" means "what to
think."  There is so much political indoctrination going on, I must spend
considerable time debriefing my children.

Yes, there are "grey areas."  Mostly, I think this is because either we
haven't yet ascertained the facts, or you are discussing a complex issue
for which no one fact is dominant.

Throw out "black and white facts," and you throw out concrete knowledge.

IAN: Interesting. This would might explain the plane braking apart 
and falling for some distance, it got cut in half. But then what 
ignites the fuel? I am encouraged that they missile story is 
net being canned, it seems.

IAN: I believe that the radar operator saw something, something that
coincided with the witness of over 100 people. Why should these 
pentagon officials wish to remain secret? Sounds like they may have

gets out that it was a military "snafu" and they were covering

IAN: I never suggested the media was covering up anything regarding, 
this matter, I even used media reports as the only basis for considering 
a missile. It's strange how whenever someone questions the govt-line
regarding events, instantly people think one supports every known
conspiracy theory. 

However, the media's complicity in covering up govt misconduct 
is overwhelming. Waco is a case with dozens of proofs of this. The 
media is often the original source of info, which then never becomes
part of the final story. With rare exceptins, the media's final story 
is almost always the govt's final story. The book VOTESCAM provides 
overwhelming evidence/proof of media/govt conspiracy. 

It's a shocking book. You can get a copy of VOTESCAM via:

IAN: I never said anything remotely akin to "only a handful of conspiracy
theorists have access to its substance" ?? I simply spoke about the 
statements made in the press clipping I sighted. People make claims 
and we judge them on a case by case basis.

Subject: Witnesses Confirm Missile Took Down TWA 800

           Witnesses Confirm Missile Took Down TWA 800

                        by J. Orlin Grabbe

        An article from the *New York Post* (reproduced below) cites FBI
interviews with 154 credible witnesses that a missile took down TWA Flight
800.

        In my original post on the subject, "The Downing of TWA Flight
800," on July 23, I said the normal normal procedure for personnel who
have received intelligence training (in this case Syria-trained terrorists)
would have been to fire the missile from a small boat off shore.  In
subsequent posts, "Bill Clinton's Choo-Choo" and "The Phosphorous-Headed
Missile and TWA Flight 800", I clarified that the missile was targeted at
the center, or belly, fuel tank.  A couple of months later, the *Post* now
comes belatedly comes to the same conclusion:

        "Law-enforcement sources said the hardest evidence
        gathered so far overwhelmingly suggests a surface-to-air
        missile -- with the sophisticated ability to lock on the
        center of a target rather than its red-hot engines -- was
        fired from a boat off the Long Island coast to bring down
        the airliner July 17."

        Only two details are lacking for the *Post* to have the entire
story.  First, they need to disregard the FBI's falsified figure of
13,700 for the altitude at which the plane was hit (the real number is
about 7,600 feet).  Secondly, they need to figure out it was the forward
end, or head, of the missile that was glowing.  As noted in a *New York
Times* article about one of the missile photographs, "It is in a roughly
horizontal position, although its left end is tilted downward.  Its right
end seems to be brightly lighted." ("Is that a Missile? Snapshot on Night
of Air Crash Turns Hot," New York Times, August 26, 1996).

        And why was the elevated end, or head, of the missile glowing?
As I previously reported, the ordinary head of the Stinger had been replaced
with two small attachments--the first one containing a different guidance
system that allowed the missile to lock-in on the center fuel tank, the
second one being a phosphorous head that was designed to blow up fuel tanks
in a violently effective manner.

        The post article follows.

New York Post
September 22, 1996
TWA Probers: Missile Witnesses "Credible"

By MURRAY WEISS
Criminal Justice Editor

More than 150 "credible" witnesses -- including several scientists --
have told the FBI and military experts they saw a missile destroy TWA
Flight 800, The Post has learned.

Sources provided startling new details from the frustrating two-month
probe -- persuading agents to acknowledge that the witnesses' accounts
point toward a missile:

The FBI interviewed 154 "credible" witnesses -- including scientists,
schoolteachers, Army personnel and business executives -- who
described seeing a missile heading through the sky just before Flight
TWA 800 exploded.

"Some of these people are extremely, extremely credible," a top
federal official said.

Sources said the witnesses lived or were vacationing along Long
Island's South Shore in Nassau and Suffolk counties when they saw the
object heading toward the sky.

"When we asked what they saw and where they saw it, the witnesses out
east pointed to the west, and the people to the west pointed to the
east ," one source said.

FBI technicians mapped the various paths -- points in the sky where
the witnesses said they saw the rising "flare-like" object -- and
determined that the "triangulated" convergence point was virtually
where the jumbo jet initially exploded.

Struck by the number and confidence of the witnesses, the FBI sat down
many of the witnesses with U.S. military experts, who debriefed them
and independently confirmed for the FBI that their descriptions
matched surface-to-air missile attacks.

"The military experts told us that what the witnesses were describing
was consistent with a missile," a federal official acknowledged. "They
told us, "You know what they are describing is a missile.' "

Law-enforcement sources said the hardest evidence gathered so far
overwhelmingly suggests a surface-to-air missile -- with the
sophisticated ability to lock on the center of a target rather than
its red-hot engines -- was fired from a boat off the Long Island coast
to bring down the airliner July 17.

That theory would have the attackers launching their missile from a
boat and fleeing north into Canada during the confusion immediately
after the explosion. Investigators are reviewing an anonymous threat
received after the Oct. 1, 1995, conviction of radical sheik Omar
Abdel Rahman, a law-enforcement source said.

The threat was that a New York area airport or jetliner would be
attacked in retaliation for the prosecution of the sheik, convicted of
plotting to blow up major New York City landmarks.

Investigators have been unable to find definitive evidence proving any
of their three key theories: missile, bomb planted in the plane or a
mechanical malfunction.

On Friday, the bomb theory took another tumble when the FBI revealed
the plane had carried explosives within a year of the crash as part of
a training exercise for drug-sniffing dogs.

That revelation could explain how traces of explosives were found on
wreckage of the downed Boeing 747.

The overriding obstacle for investigators probing the missile theory
has been the fact that Flight 800's engines show no signs of missile
damage.

But military experts told the FBI several modern heat-<JU>seeking
missiles -- in the hands of terrorists in Africa and available to
their Middle East counterparts -- target a plane's "central mass."

These missiles -- launched from a shoulder harness or a small pad --
different from the Stinger missiles that Afgani freedom fighters used
against the Russians -- are equipped with a super-sophisticated heat-
seeking device and are able to reach higher targets.

TWA 800 exploded at 13,700 feet -- the upper limit for the newest of
these portable-type missile systems.

Military experts pointed the FBI to man-portable missiles such as the
SA -14 Gremlin, SA-16 Gimlet and SA-18 Grouse -- equipped with
"proportional convergence logic" systems that are "sensitive enough to
home in on airframe radiation" once it nears its target, rather than
isolated hot spots.

IAN: I never assumed that what I said had any bearing on

IAN: I believe your correct that by truth-meme Ira did not imply 
"truth-meme = no missile." However, coming off the "Navy
missile theory = anti-gravity claims" it was not obvious to me,
it is unexpected to imply a claim is crack-potism and then turn
around and consider that maybe it is real. But, that seems to be
what Ira did, so I own Ira an apology: Ira, sorry dude.

 > As to whether we can imagine 100 people being mistaken in unison,
 > the answer is yes.  It happens all the time.

IAN: We might as well throw all eyewitness testimony out the window.
Any eyewitness report is just as likely a hallucination as any other.
Even if over 100 people see the same thing at the same time, it's no 
more a measure of truth than if one person sees it. Pretty radical 
standard.

 > Your attack on something other than what 
 > was actually said does not support your case.

IAN: The only measure of support for my case I ever suggested was
the report of 100+ witnesses and radar. I never suggested that 
my words were making this testimony more valid. But of course
since eyewitness is totally unreliable, it seems there is zero
evidence of any missile. The missile theory is swept away.

IAN: But it is evidence, which seems much more than you'll allow.

Now we're getting somewhere. I really feel that your analogy is
inappropriate. Our understanding of computer hardware and software
is considerably more complete than is our understanding of the world
economy, and we have demonstrated the ability to continue to increase
the capabilities of both hardware and software enormously since the
development of the computer. Furthermore, computers are already being
used
to assist in the further development of computing. Good changes are not
hard to find, and 18 month's worth of development results in a doubling
of capability. Yes, I do "imagine" that there are a long series of "big
wins". I base this on the recent 30-year trend. Yes I'm very aware that
Moore's law is purely empirical and that there are arguments that the
rate
must slow down for various physical reasons. I'm also aware that similar
arguments have been advanced every year since the promulgation of
Moore's
law, but the rate hasn't slowed. All of this has occured before the
advent
of an intelligence with a computer component.

I'm not arguing that our human minds are poorly designed. First, I
believe
that the human mind is evolved, not designed. For complex systems that
I'm
aware of (computer software sytems, mostly), an evolved system can
generally
be replaced by a designed system that uses the behaviour of the evolved
system as a functional specification. This will generally result in
dramatic
performance improvement. By analogy, it would be possible to design an
improved human brain, IF we had a complete understanding of how the
brain
works. Since we don't, we can't design a new one on the same principles.
I argue that we don't have to. Instead, we will develop an intelligent
entity that has a computer as one component. This entity will be smart
enough
to develop new hardware and software to augment itself. This the
fundamentally
new factor.

We've actually already developed the primitive precursors of this
entity.
a computor development organization that uses its own computers to
develop
the next generation computer, or a software tools shop that uses its own
tools to develop its next-generation tools, is such an entity. However,
these primitive examples are not yet focused on self-augmentation, and
are not tightly-integrated enough to precipitate a runaway fast-feedback
of self-augmentation.

The expected time to go through the sequence of events is the sum 
of the expected times of each step, if they are independent.
So it makes sense to ask which of the steps contain most of the
filter.

	Of course conspiracies are stronger than the truth!  That is why
the State in all its facets and glory exists!

	As a HVAC contractor for many years, I know that contractors plot
constantly when they get together about how they can "strengthen"
licensing enforcement so as to reduce competition.

	In public they automatically switch to "licensing helps the
public"!  This is a conspiracy by my definition even though most of the
participants wouldn't define it as such.  They are so intimately involved
with the realities of their industry that they engage in the conspiracy
like automata, as second nature.

>Can you give examples of conspiracy theories which have turned out true?

Offhand, I can't think of any really large-scale conspiracy theories which
have turned out true, but then on the other hand there certainly have been
a number of authoritarian conspiracies among highly-placed figures which
have turned out true, even though these have been small-scale. The Nixon
circle's Watergate conspiracy. The Nazi conspiracy to destroy the Weimar
constitution (this was not the platform that they were elected on,
exactly). The currently debated Whitewater conspiracy. And then there was
the Guy Fawkes conspiracy, just to show that those who are out of power can
cook up some sophisticated cabals as well.

The "grand-scale" conspiracy theorists often point to the fact that these
smaller conspiracies are usually not traced to their roots... they are only
traced a certain distance before the conspirators' efforts to destroy
evidence (and witnesses) succeed in foiling the detectives. And from this
they surmise that there really are grand-scale conspiracies operating
throughout history, of which these smaller-scale authoritarian conspiracies
are mere outcroppings.

The point James Daugherty just made about how people operating in their
ordinary unquestioned modes of thinking can often be participating in a
conspiracy without even being aware that they are conspiring is a good one.
I have lately been amazed by how little people are aware of what they are
doing, since I've just recently become aware of a few things that I've been
working hard toward all my life without being aware of doing so until now.
I'm sure more such revelations await me in the future, as I become able to
devote a few more leisure hours to introspection than I used to.

I used to think that conspiracy theories were a bunch of hooey, and I'd
still be suspicious about (a) those who swallow them hook, line, and sinker
and (b) those who seek to convince young and gullible people of their
truth. But since I've managed to deal with the "harsher realities" of
carving out a comfortable living for myself in the world, I feel that I can
now be little more "soft in the head", and after investigating some of the
conspiracy theories myself, I think they are worth investigating by some
people.

If I ever get rich and take care of most of my personal goals and don't see
any more pressing problems on my horizon (like industrializing the Jovian
moons or writing a choral ballet that Ravel would be envious of), then I
might take up keeping an eye on the Trilateral Commission as an interesting
hobby which might be potentially far more valuable than, say, watching
football. And since I'm not the type to take football fans to task for
their vices, I don't think I'd be interested in arguing against conspiracy
theorists either. I'm glad they're keeping an eye on things... just in
case.

The only caution that remains, of course, is that the Nazis did their
damage, in part, by exploiting the fears of anti-Semitic conspiracy
theorists. And this may be the main reason why I'm not interested in taking
up the abovementioned hobby for myself at this point in history.

That's not a good analogy to Nanotechnology, but you can turn it into one if  
you make 2 slight adjustments. (NOTE: I use the term "slight adjustments" in  
the same spirit you did in a previous post.)

1) Instead of having one Bechtel and one IBM etc, there are trillions of them. 
2) Each Bechtel or IBM is able to make an exact copy of itself, of the same   
   size and the same quality, in a few days, perhaps a few hours.

It's a straw man to keep talking about things being free, but In such a world  
the supply of engineering services would be astronomically larger than it is 
now, and the last time I looked at an Economics text book the supply of  
something is an important factor determining the cost of that thing.

To design interesting structures intelligence is very handy to have, it  
certainly makes things happen MUCH faster, but it isn't absolutely necessary,  
just look at evolution. As for manufacturing, that doesn't need intelligence 
at all. Ribosomes would score a zero on a IQ test, yet they can make EXTREMELY
complex proteins if they receive the correct digital information that tells 
them how from messenger RNA. Actually they can do even better than that, 
as long as they receive the correct digital information that tells the how to 
do it they can make even more complex objects, objects like you and me.
                      
This doesn't mean there won't be super human artificial intelligence, there  
most certainly will be, I just want to point out that a lot can happen even 
without it.           


                >Why would a mite-sized Exxon take orders from me, when the

In other words, would you or me have any control over all this? I don't know. 
I never said we would be rich, or that we would even be around, I only said  
that the price of things will drop to almost, but not quite, zero. I am not 
at all convinced that we will survive the turmoil of the singularity, 
but we might, at least it's a chance, and without it we are all doomed to old 
age and oblivion. That is reason for hope, and at the very least, things 
won't be dull.

I agree that the 18 month doubling rate of capacity is likely to
continue.  However, I'm not convinced that this rate depends much on
the "IQ" of the researchers involved.  

If this doubling rate were very sensitive to the total number or
researchers, lots more researchers would be hired to speed up the
process.   If it depended sensitively on the IQ of these researchers, 
a higher premium would be placed on hiring high IQ researchers.  

To the contrary, there are lots of good ideas, and the big expense is
doing the grunge work of trying them out.  Raw smarts helps a little
in picking the winners, but not that much.  How much grunge work gets
done depends on the size of the global market for computers.  

Tightly integrated self-augmentation groups *have* been tried, with
poor success.  The fact is that progress depends much more on lots of
little improvements across the whole economy than many people want to
admit.  

So uploads and artificial intelligences will improve their hardware
and software, increasing the productivity of mental labor at a faster
rate than has been possible so far.  But that doesn't imply a flash
of super-accelerating growth - just a faster growth rate.

I read the same article and got a different hit.  If memory loss results from 
subtle changes in neuronal function, then perhaps invisible and irreparable 
damage is done during cryonic suspension.  Furthermore, it is often
 more difficult to prevent and/or correct subtle damage to cells and tissues 
than it is to prevent and/or correct gross damage or death.  Brain cells that 
look normal anatomically may not function normally and important i
nformation (memories) may be lost. Thus, the report in Science News is not 
necessarily good news for cryonics.

Information? Computed? Obviously, you are not referring to the

A generic computation can be defined in terms of mapping an input vector 
to an output vector. (This is so abstract, it encompasses about 
everything). If this is a simulation, "rightness" metric would mean its 
congruency with that part of reality we set out to model (of course, not 
the real reality, but our measurement of the reality by means of 
senses/gadgets, a fingerprint delta).

Concerning "right" inputs: there must be a mapping function defined over 
the entire space of input vectors. For such a computation there are no 
"wrong" inputs.

A computer implementation of this must be bug-free, orelse some vectors 
are not mapped: the computer crashes, the mapping is not defined.

I don't know, whether you refer to minimum discount in terms of 
complexity theory.

If terms of computing steps, the minimum O() to sort N random numbers 
for a purely sequential process would be at least O(N). (Obviously, we 
need to look at each number at least once, and only if to make sure 
whether they're already sorted).

That a minimum complexity threshold exist, is not open do doubt. Each 
clearly defined task has such threshold. Some of this is easy to prove, 
some of it terribly hard. Just think about NP-complete and NP-hard 
problems.

I think this can be intuitively called "no free lunch" conjecture. (I 
know there is a lock on that string already, but this is a local 
environment definition of limited visibility scope ;)

To improve itself, the system needs not to understand itself entirely, it 
isn't even possible. Improvement, probably drastical, is possible by 
comparatively piffling investments. Using digital evolution for 
optimization purposes is one such instance. I don't care for the method, 
just for the result I wish to obtain. The method might be just too boring 
(automagical) or plain too complicated.

We've made excellent progress relatively recently, which still shows no

Agree.

This must be the overestimation of the century. We can understanding the 
basics of the economy, we don't understand the gestalt (top-level 
phenomena) at all. Some of world economy is ergodic (at least at times 
it is). Meaning, it is fundamentally unpredictable as is... weather 
(unless spacetime is deterministic, and God kindly gives you an account 
with root rights).

If we'd have the understanding, we would be able to engineer the future 
trajectory of the development. I am not sure I will live to see such 
accomplishment.

Robin, positive intelligence autofeedback loops are unprecendented. It 
does no good looking for comparisons. Because there are none. The 
Cambrian explosion is often used as an (imperfect) comparison. I think it 
will be far more drastic.

I think he is right. A computer/human hybride performs significantly 
better than the isolated human. And that's just the beginning.

Human IQ is (assymetrically) bell-shaped distributed. It spans the 
entire spectrum, from moron to Einstein. Assuming, everybody is an 
Einstein equivalent? Surely, this must have some impact upon the world?

We don't know, whether there is a limit to cognition capacity. At a 
guess, there is none. The only limits are those of computational physics. 

Assuming, we've already hit them, or are even approaching them is not 
realistic, imo.

I think there is none. Observation is part of the experiment. Afaik there 
is nothing in the definition of the experimental setup requiring it to be 
created by human experimentators. It has just to be well defined.

Exactly as you wrote, experimental setups & observation (measurement) 
procedere are designed to reduce impacts of undesired variables, ideally 
excluding them altogether.

In social sciences experiments are usually impossible. Even observations
of system's behavious, are difficult, since isolated systems either do 
not exist or the entire range of relevant parameters is impossible to 
obtain and/or to interprete.

Yes. This is a change of parameters. The universe is one great lab. By 
choosing appropriate observation locations much can be learned.

I think you are using an unconventional definition of an experiment.

Aargh, this begs to be taken apart!  :)


>"All facts were matters of degree.  The facts were always
>fuzzy or vague or inexact to some degree.

Yes, this is a very popular stance in today's US scholar establishment,
and it is also total semantic hogwash.  According to Webster:

fact \'fakt\ n [L factum, fr. neut. of factus, pp. of facere]
1: a thing done : as 1a: CRIME {accessory after the ~} obs
1b: FEAT archaic 1c: ACTION archaic
2: PERFORMANCE, DOING
3: the quality of being actual : ACTUALITY
4a: something that has actual existence 4b: an actual occurrence : EVENT
5: a piece of information presented as having objective reality

Read this carefully.  There are *no* fuzzy facts.  Instead, fuzziness
itself may be a fact of measurement or observation.  Vagueness means
lack of knowledge.  Inexactness means extensive knowledge about the
scope of applicability of facts.  Truthfulness is yet another attribute,
the most relevant of all mentioned to the word "fact."


>Only math was
>black and white and it was just an artificial system of 
>rules and symbols.

Artificial?  Oh, please!  Is a rock more fundamental than number 1?

There is nothing "black" or "white" about mathematics, although it
*is* a system of rules and symbols, and a very successful one for
modelling fuzziness among other things.


>Science treated the grey or fuzzy facts
>as if they were the black/white facts of math.

Oh, yes?  So I must be out of this world since I'm spending months
studying errors of measurement in order to publish a paper about some
facts I measured in less than a week?


>Yet no one
>had put forth a single fact about the world that was 100%
>true or 100% false.

Hmm, let's see:  the world exists?  Sounds pretty 100%-ish to me,
for all practical purposes.


>They just said they all were.

Ah, now we get to the bottom: context, context!

The WP reports the fuel would have possibly been ignited by the
missile hitting the fuel tank, even though it lacked a warhead.

TidBit: This story was minor, buried inside. The news last night
discounted the missile theory on the grounds that the plane was out
of range of shoulder-fired missiles(?!?!?).

Ira never promoted 'clinging to black and white facts'.  Ira was 
responding to an apparent attitude that 'everything we think we 
know should be considered grey'.  If all ideas are considered 
equally grey, then it is impossible to learn anything.  I think 
the trouble is that some people only think in terms of a single 
shade of grey, as if all ideas that contain an element of 
uncertainty must be equally uncertain.  But that's not so.  
Certainty comes in all shades of grey from black to white.  
There's nothing wrong with treating all ideas as 'grey' if we 
recognize that they're not the *same* grey.

But what does 'tolerance of gray areas' mean?

Does it mean 'treating all ideas as equally grey as an excuse 
to remain overly suspicious of old, established ideas while regarding 
new, untested ideas with more credibility than they deserve'?

Does it mean 'respecting the rights of gray areas by refraining from 
tryin to make them any less gray'?

Or does it simply mean 'acknowledging that there is a degree of 
uncertainty in all ideas, and dealing with that rationally'?

What evidence is there that Rosen's models describe reality better than
the usual ones? 

And where does Tipler rely on modelling complex systems as Markov
processes? His main arguments about the Eternal Return and the Bekenstein
Bound applies to just about any system; even if the system does it best
to be unpredictable or organized it *has to* repeat itself in a finite
time if it is finite and non-growing. Markov processes are awfully general.

What is the evidence that vacuum is not a state of near maximal entropy? 
(One vacuum with virtual particles looks like any other vacuum -> *very* 
high entropy)

This debate seems to be going in circles, so let me summarize my view:

Really, what is claimed by the originators of the navy missile + cover-up
theory is that the U.S. government knew the cause from the very beginning
and has somehow tricked the entire population into believing there is an
"investigation" going on.  This is just as preposterous as someone claiming
to have invented an anti-gravity machine in the absence of significant
prior research.

The 100+ eyewitnesses may have seen a missile, or they may have seen
something else -- people sometimes misinterpret what they see in the dark.
But one thing I am certain they didn't see: hundreds of people converging
on the crash site to cover it up.

IAN: The AP just ran an article that says, even though there is no
evidence of a mechanical failure, it may likely be the "victorious"
theory. Bizarre, check it out (emphasis added):

      By Larry Neumeister, Associated Press, 09/23/96; 17:02 

      SMITHTOWN, N.Y. (AP) - The possibility that some kind of
      cataclysmic malfunction brought down TWA Flight 800 suddenly
      seems more plausible to some investigators now that the already
      shaky bomb theory has been weakened. .....

      Some NTSB investigators are so convinced of a malfunction that
      they expect the FBI to END its criminal probe soon, an NTSB
      source said.  ........

      Investigators say the black boxes, cockpit, engines and recovered
      wreckage have shown NOTHING to indicate a number of mechanical
      failures - engines falling off, an engine explosion or a major
      structural failure. 
      ........

In the meantime, evidence for a missile keeps growing (see NY Post 
article forwarded by James), but NO evidence for mechanical failure 
seems more attractive to some investigators.?? One gets the feeling 
that there are some investigators working for the truth, while 
others are no so inclined. Who will win, and why ?

Huh?  There is no distinction between observation and experiment, and
yet social science experiments are impossible while observations are 
difficult?   Is there a distinction or isn't there?

Also, there is *no* field of inquiry where completely isolated systems
exist or the entire range of relevant parameters is known to have been
obtained.

This of course depends a lot on your views of death; if you regard
yourself as supremely important in your own universe, then you should
avoid all risks, while if you regard your existence as just another fun
aspect of the universe you can take some risks (up to a limit determined
by how non-I-centered you are). 

Personally I avoid unnecessary risks and try to plan for possible future 
contingencies, but I do not regard my survival as the one and only 
driving force of my existence.

I think hyperchess has the drawback that it is an extremely complex game; 
how many entities are good enough at chess and cognitive science to play it 
well?

A suggestion: post the propsal to chess newsgroups and similar places if 
you have not already done it. I will place a web page about it on my 
site.

I'm thinking of Englebart's SRI team in the early 70s, where they invented
the mouse, windows, the first full hypertext publishing environment,
etc.  Probably the most successful such attempt.  A team that takes
off by focusing on its own augmentation was Englebart's big thing, but
it created an ingrown focus that made it difficult for them to make
their tools useful for other people.  They would claim these tools
were useful, if you were willing to invest enough time in it, but
others preferred WYSIWYG.  Mostly it was the ideas they pioneered that
have lived on, not their specific tools.  Englebart is still pushing
his vision.  See:

I don't think I understand your comments here.  But rather than get
distracted with this, let me rephrase my position on the main point.

Dan claims that any agent faced with the choice between sending out
probes to colonize the universe and staying home and using the probe
mass to compute stuff, would rather stay home.  The idea is that there
is no information that could be returned from the colonized universe
that couldn't be more quickly computed by that probe mass staying
home.   This seems a remarkable claim to me.

Of course it is precedented.  That is exactly what research feeding back
into education is.  As humanity learns more, we get better at learning
more, and our understanding expands.  It just doesn't explode as fast
as you think possible.

Of course it will.  And human IQ *does* seem to be have increasing for
the last century.  Hal posted on this a few months (or was it a year) ago.

I think when you factor in self-deception, state-specific

that conspiracy is just one region of a locus of points in socail

Or does it simply mean 'acknowledging that there is a degree of

I say:
Close. What I happen to prefer is the kind of mental resilience that 
permits one to hold a bunch of truths constant while looking at the 
world, remembering from time to time that "certainty" is a state of 
mind, not matter. 

The phrase "dealing with that rationally" is one I wouldn't use... 
"dealing with that wisely" might be closer to my goal. 
Categories are very useful. So is the ability to think outside 
the box. 

I think I understand why people get upset with the fuzzy
situational ethicists etc. running the US educational system. I begin 
to think that what's happening is rather like the "new math" fiasco 
made of the Bourbaki school back in my youth--superficial misleading 
"teaching" being done by "teachers" who don't really understand the
material, leaving the students completely clueless about the "why" 
and the deep structure.

Tragic but tough to prevent. I'm reminded of Stephenson's (sp?) 
observation in _Diamond Age_ that the children of the first-gen 
Vickys didn't come to a decision about social fabric, they were born 
into a pattern--so they locked into it like the good little meat 
machines they were. (sigh)

If you value yourself you don't avoid all risks. Risks are an essential
aspect of living a full life. Survival without flourishing is not valuing
yourself.

We probably all agree that our own *survival* is not the one and only
driving force, however, if not our own survival then what? Feelings? Where
do they come from? Subconscious evaluations. How do we *consciously*
evaluate them? Some of our emotions are destructive to us. Values? How do we
establish those? How do we set our goals?

Whatever we live for has to be based on our values, not so? Theses values
are on a spectrum from subconscious (emotions) to conscious (rational).

Anders, and others: What are those other driving forces? Especially ones
that you may consider more important than your own survival and happiness?

I personally strive to have all my values, emotions and actions focused on
personal survival and well-being - important aspects of which include
meaningful human relationships and a free and healthy society. I consider
reason to be the best method to achieve these goals - and emotions essential
to enjoying them.

*This is not a direct response to either Damien's query or Anders'
response; but, since I just responded to another post regarding Tipler's
"Physics of Immortality", and since I have my 'archives' open, maybe a
dump of some more of my notes on this might be of interest.*

10/20/94. Reading ch.10 of "Physics of Immortality" wherein Tipler
describes "What Happens After the Resurrection: Heaven, Hell &
Purgatory" noting that "all possible combinations of resurrected dead
can be placed in the same simulation and allowed to interact". I argue
that such resurrections would be chimeras, not representing actual
historical persons, because the Omega Point could not possibly know,
which of many possible simulations actually happened. In fact, as he
suggests, "the Omega Point would be able to advise us on possible
imperfections"; so, the result would not be anything representing a
resurrection of historical personalities. In fact, as he proves using
game theory and Becker's notions of utility functions, such resurrected
beings would be more altruistic than (and thus not identical to) us
mortal beings in a world of finite resources.

Tipler uses the notion of infinity to resolve the Tristram Shandy and
Hilbert's Hotel paradoxes, essentially implying that infinity can
accomodate all possible permutations; therefore, whatever actually
happened historically will eventually happen in the final emulation. I
grant this; but, I still ask, how will the Omega Point KNOW which of
these infinite combinations of phase trajectories represents the
actualized past and is, thus, a 'true' resurrection.

Tipler discusses the problem of Evil and God's responsibility, the
principle of nonsatiation, and theodicy. Using Hayek's theories
regarding 'the supply of capital', he concludes that "Any cosmology with
progress to infinity will necessarily end in [infinite wealth] God." I
can accept this and don't question what the Omega Point can/will
accomplish. What I question is whether this will represent a genuine
resurrection, and eternal life, for ALL those who HAVE lived and died
during the actual light cone of this Earth. As he notes, "It is not even
necessary for ANY of the past to be repeated." Thus, while my life
experience IN GENERAL will certainly be emulated by the Omega Point, it
is impossible for the Omega Point to emulate my life experiences IN
PARTICULAR by any 'brute-force' simulation. Therefore, unless I dismiss
myself as a simple instance of some universal pattern of experience, I
can not expect an individual resurrection in the Omega Point.

According to the Law of Mass Action, I am indistinguishable from
multitudes of others who have followed my same general pattern of
development. The Omega Point will not recall the physical specifics and
random fluctuations of my life, just as my memory does not store
everything it experiences; but (due to data compression economics), is
capable only of accessing certain general archetypes, i.e, normalized
relations and experiences. So, this means there is no personal
resurrection, only resurrection of principals, of 'spirits'. If I am one
who strives toward an altruistic ideal, this will be satisfactory; in
other words, I will be resurrected in 'heaven'. However, if I am one who
strives to be unique, or who is basically Narcisistic in my experiences,
I can expect no resurrection at all, only the damnation of eternal
return, stuck in an infinite loop, or perhaps I will simply be treated
as noise and be deleted from the 'Final Reality'.

'Misinterpreting what you see in the dark' isn't likely to be a very convincing 
sounding explanation for 100+ witnesses reporting a missile.  But people 
have been known to:

a) lie through their teeth for the sake of attention
b) say 'hey, me too!' once a claim like that starts circulating
c) re-interpret hazy memories after the fact to fit an exciting theory
and so on.

To determine whether the testimony of those 100+ witnesses are accurate, 
the investigators have to try to weed out these possibilities.  One good 
question to ask would be: "How many of these 100+ witnesses called in 
to report what they saw *before* the incident started getting media 
coverage?"  A very poor means of determining their accuracy (though 
apparently, this is what some investigators have done) is to ask them, 
after the fact, to point to where they saw it.  After the fact, each and every 
one of them has had access to extensive media coverage of the incident, 
including maps showing exactly where the plane went down.  It would be 
no big suprise for anyone motivated by a desire for attention, or mere 
wishful thinking, to adjust their story to accomodate widely-known facts.

Uh Oh - I was afraid that I'd bitten off a little too much with that
post!

I warned that I had not studied Rosen. I believe his point is that
mechanical models of physics do not allow systems to act in an
anticipatory fashion, something that some believe to be the case in
living organisms, while others might argue that it is simply a matter of
mechanical natural selection.  As for what Rosen means by "much else
besides" organic phenomena, I haven't a clue at this point.

That's a poor response so I guess I'll have to get and read Rosen's
latest book:"Life Itself: A Comprehensive Inquiry into the Nature,
Origin, and Fabrication of Life". Here's one review of it:
"Book News, Inc., 02/01/92: In a sophisticated (but clear and
understandable) exposition, Rosen (physiology and biophysics, Dalhousie
U.) rejects both the necessity and the sufficiency of the mechanistic
model/metaphor for biological life, and proposes an alternative, drawn
equally from experience in biology, physics, and mathematics. Annotation

You are probably correct that Tipler does not rely on Markov processes
in his arguments.  The following is my *very* _naive_ interpretation of
this from a fragment of some notes I took after reading "The Physics of
Immortality".  I think I was using Markov processes as a proxy for the
even more general idea of determinism.

10/31/94. I submit that most real-world processes do not evolve as
Markov chains because state Xi+1 is NOT dependent ONLY on the state the
system is in at state Xi. Random inputs from the environment during the
transition to state Xi+1 can cause the next state to be quite
discontinuous from state Xi. For example, a machine normally wears down
in a manner consistent with a Markov process; but, accidents can happen
at any point and thus break the chain. Of course, in this case, the
probability of an accident could be incorporated into the calculation of
the transition probabilities. However, in the case of living systems
that are also actively seeking new inputs as well as encountering them
by chance, the assumption of stationary transition probabilities seems
absurd.

We are not Markov chains because we have memory AND we can plan ahead.
In other words, in addition to accidents and active seeking of
alternatives, we also are able to apply past states (experience) to
current situations. The teleology of being nostalgic and goal-directed
violates the first-order Markovian property of finite-state systems.
What this means is that, yes, we may go along for a while, stuck in a
rut so to speak, advancing step by step according to stationary
transition probabilities; but, we are also able to suddenly recall a
previous, perhaps long-ago state, that somehow seems relevant to our
current situation, and we make a 'quantum leap', an attitude adjustment.
In short, Tipler's basic assumption that humans are finite-state
machines and, therefore, can be simulated, by brute force in the
all-powerful future, is irrelevant.  Even if A SINGLE entity can be IN
only a finite number of states, this does not mean that there are ONLY a
finite number of TOTAL states that an entity can choose from.

While acknowledging free will and the randomness of experience, Tipler
seems to imply that, in the long run, none of these idiosyncracies
matter because we will settle into a 'pattern'. It is the common
patterns, not the individual peculiarities, which are 'immortal', which
will be resurrected by the Omega Point.  All flaws will be removed in
the 'heaven' of the Omega Point, except perhaps as isolated, static
perversions available only for pious reflection and academic reference,
but not allowed to exist in practice.

Vacuum: 1. emptiness of space, 2. a space absolutely devoid of matter
(or voided of matter to the highest degree possible).

I think you are correct that vacuum is "in a state of near maximal
entropy."  I am saying that space cannot be considered a mere vacuum, it
must be seen as a communications medium, even a cyberspace, for
electromagnetic energy (not to mention gravity).  As far as cosmic rays
& 'vital' dust being the 'archives of the universe', that was pretty
much wild speculation on my part.  However, these cosmic rays and dust
do contain reams of information about the past cosmos.  Perhaps space
could be compressed, if that wouldn't impact its ability to transmit
information or allow material processes to occur.  One of the things I
criticized about the Strong Nanotech posts (as Dan Clemmensen wrote on
9/22/96 : "With MNT, all I need to produce an item is the design for the
item, and matter, and energy.") was that they assumed no need for
'geospace' or other infrastructure.

Also, Taoists and others are fond of telling us to study the spaces
between things (the relationships) rather than just the things
themselves.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Ira Brodsky is concerned about children being taught that things are grey and 
uncertain.  Yes, there are facts that we are very certain about, and it's 
important that children are taught these facts.  However, it's also a fact 
that most things are uncertain to us, and we need to develop the appropriate 
mental skills to adaquately deal with uncertainty.  The big mistake that A LOT 
of people make is to think that because nearly everything is uncertain, that 
these things are all uncertain *to the same degree*, that everything is 
*equally* uncertain.  Some people say that everything is relative, so you 
can't hold one opinion or belief to be better than any other.  Of course, they 
neglect to consider that some beliefs are ALWAYS *relatively* BETTER than 
others (just like 500 is relatively more than 3).  The mistake is in lumping 
all greyness together into one category, when there are actually many shades 
of grey.  Some facts are more certain than others.  And when thinking about 
these facts, you must consider how certain they are and how much weight to 
give them in your reasoning.  Read 'Fuzzy Thinking' by Bart Kosko.  He shows 
how to reason with fuzzy and uncertain knowledge.

I do agree with Ira that our educational systems are pretty fucked-up.  
However, I think that children must be taught facts AND they must be taught 
how to reason appropriately with insufficient and uncertain information.  But 
Ira's right, there's a tremendous amount of political indoctrination going on 
in the Slave Training Institutes, which are euphemistically called Public 
Schools.  And I think that often, the children there are being taught that 
everything is equally uncertain, so you can just believe anything, because no 
belief is better than any other.  This is just one of the many forms of mental 
sabotage inflicted upon our children by our government.

I wonder if the majority will ever figure out how they've been duped.  Will 
they ever realize that the government is really just a con game, run by con 
men who call themselves "public servants"?  The goods they sell are terribly 
shoddy, and the prices they charge are outrageous!  Yet people keep coming 
back for more.  Of course, they haven't yet realized that their religions are 
con games either.  I think humans have a high capacity for being deluded.  And 
I'm no exception; I'm just *less* deluded than the majority of people (at 
least, I like to think so).

I was considering this thought. The best way to be uploaded is to
genetically engineer an organism that would grow into your brain and destroy
a neuron and map the equivelant connections in a virtual world. This
organism would serve as an interface between brain and machine. After
destroying the neuron, the organism would fill the gap with itself and have
all connections from other neurons be redirected through the interface to
the virtual brain map inside a virtual world inside a computer. Long term
memory would be deleted and recreated and redirected to the computer first
which would make things slightly longer to retrieve while the organism
slowly grew into and took over your brain. This would enable you to grow
into the virtual world to where you could switch between both and then
eventually disconnect all biological senses entirely and live inside this
virtual world. Is this better than cloning yourself inside a machine and
destroying the original biological copy and thus kill off 'you' your
self-aware being for some clone knowing everything you know living inside a
virtual world? Also how difficult would it be to engineer this organism?

With which I entirely agree. And would add, somewhat more prosaically:

Cling to black and white facts, and annoy an awful lot of very successful

What you consider 'wise', and what the next fellow considers 
'wise', may be two different things.  While you might consider it 
'wise' to utilize "the kind of mental resilience that permits one to 
hold a bunch of truths constant while looking at the world, 
remembering from time to time that "certainty" is a state of 
mind" (which I generally agree with), others might consider it 
'wise' to react in other ways.  I prefer not to make blanket 
reccomendations of subjective things like 'wisdom', because 
I can't know what they mean to the person I'm dealing with. 
On the other hand, there are pretty clear rules about what 
does and does not constitute rational thought.

In any case, it's unclear to me how your use of 'wisdom' differs 
from my use of 'reason' in this matter.  Both of us accept 
that we must adopt very likely propositions as 'truths', even 
though some uncertainty may remain, in order to form a basis 
on which to continue our search for knowledge.  Both of us 
know it's important to remember that old, established 
'truths' may be overturned by later discoveries.  That is 
quite rational.  Why do you think it isn't?  Why do you think 
the process of rational thought would keep you from adopting 
exactly the stance you already hold now?

This implies that 'if people only understood the 'why' and the deep 
structure, everything would be fine.  But I understand the 'why' and the 
deep structure - and I still think it's a load of crap.  The problem is not 
that students are having it spoon-fed to them.  That's unfortunate, but 
it's not the primary reason why it upsets me.

My earlier post is probably apropo to your comments.

Just so you know, this paragraph was taken from the introduction to 
Kosko's book, _Fuzzy Thinking_, and describes his change of paradigm 
after years of being involved in the scientific community.

This statement comes closest to my own approach to learning, although 
I would extend it to include the concept of "facts".  In my mind, a 
certain humility is necessary in the pursuit of knowledge.

Yup, that's it.  I read most of the Vonnegut books all at once, and
can never remember which titles go with which books.

 Open Peer Review concept for internet publication.

The Open Peer Review concept uses internet technologies to alleviate
problems with our current peer review system. Basically the proposed system
works by publishing scientific results on the web and appending reviewer's
comments to these web pages.  The process is open, meaning that (1) the
reviewer's names are included with their comments and (2) any qualified
scientist can review the scientific web page.  The system would be more
formal than newsgroups, but would work differently from current peer
reviewed journals.

By making the process open, we aim to reduce the conflicts of interest
which sometimes occur during peer review.  For example, very often it is a
competitor who reviews a manuscript--their personal needs compete directly
with the authors' right to a fair review based on scientific merit.
Sometimes a reviewer rejects a manuscript but then uses concepts from the
manuscript in their own work.  Under the new open system, publication of
the manuscript would always proceed.  Competitors can still review the
manuscript and make comments in the open format described below.

We are considering adoption of this Open Peer Review System for the World
Journal Club (http://www.journalclub.com/wjc1.html).  We would appreciate
any comments you have on this topic.

The proposed Open Peer Review System:

(1) Scientific merit is not assessed prior to publication.  Reviewer's
comments are appended to the publication in a PEER REVIEW section.

(2) To maintain focus, reviewer's comments are restricted to the article or
related literature.

(3) Reviewer's names and contact information are included with their
comments.

(4) Any World Journal Club member can review any World Journal Club
publication.

(5) Authors can respond to reviewer's comments by rebuttal or by appending
new results to their publication.

If you would like to publish your work under this type of system, please
request an application to join the World Journal Club.  If you do not want
to be part of this system, please reply and tell us why.  We want to
include all competent scientists, and the Open Review System may be adapted
to meet your concerns.

Sincerely,

David W. Bradley, Ph.D.

PS If you do not wish to recieve email on this topic please accept my
apology and let me know so I can remove you from the mailing list.

Why is this a 'genetically engineered organism', and not a swarm of nanobots?

I think I'd like to live in both worlds.

Call me old-fashioned, but making an immortal copy of me doesn't appear 
to *me* as if it helps *me*.  I'm not too keen on the idea of killing myself, 
even if I know that there's some other me that's ready to take up the 
slack.  What I like about the idea of progressive replacement of neurons 
is that to *me* it would feel as if nothing has changed - but I'd wind up with a 
technological brain instead of this crummy old meat contraption.  I wouldn't  
have to kill myself off to make a digital clone - I'd become digital myself.

Yes, but they would have never made it to that point had they not absorbed
entire libraries full of black and white facts. <g>

Seriously, I agree there are paradoxes, there is a time for doubting
certainty, and there is utility to fuzzy logic.  But these are not useful
starting points -- especially not for children.

Which leads me to another thought: if at bottom the universe is just grey
mush, doesn't this suggest a limit to scientific progress?  [He shudders.]
How do you control something that exists merely within a range of
probabilities?  Perhaps there are some physicists around here who can
provide reassuring answers...

Many people use the phrase "rational thought" to mean "rearranging

useful, the latter is more useful than the former, and neither one 
encompasses the entire gamut of useful thought.

	Perhaps you need to expound a bit more on HAARP.  I read part of
Angels Don't Play This HAARP, but was not knowledgeable enough to form
much of an opinion except to wonder what are lords and masteres are up
to...

	What book or article on the subject do you recommend as reliable?

If you understand how centralized authority is within the FBI you would
understand how tricking the entire population is fully within the
capability of the FBI, given the population's pathetic faith in
authorities!  When the first talk of a missle began to circulate right
after the crash a high official in the FBI, I cannot recall his name now,
announced that anyone within the Federal Government who thinks a missle
was involved needs his head examined.  This was said with no reference to
evidence of any kind....just "We're the authorities, believe us!  Stop the
missle talk!"

Apparently, you are unaware of the FBI's long history of deceit.  There
are many possible reasons the FBI might want to cover-up though all are
speculative at this time.  The US govt distributed stinger missles to
Islamic terrorists, the US govt may not want to give terrorists a
publicity victory, the US govt may be in bed with the airlines, the US
govt may want to prevent a friendly fire scandal, etc.  You may remember
the shameful conduct of the FBI hack "scientist" at the OJ trial regarding
the preservative in OJ blood sample being found at the murder site.  You
may remember Mr. Whitehurst who claims fake findings are routine at the
FBI lab.....

Dare I say you are living in a "goodie two-shoes" dream?

The problem with this proposal is, what do you put on your vita so
readers of it can quickly assess the quality of the publication?  
With an ordinary journal the journal itself signals quality.  
Sure the vita reader could go read all the reviews, but they usually 
won't have time to.

Jeff Dee wrote 9/24/96: <But what does 'tolerance of gray areas' mean?>

Good question.  I get the creeps any time I see the word "tolerance" any more.
The word has been badly abused by the holier-than-thou politically correct
brigades, who virtually always mean "intolerance" when they use it.  Likewise,
when they say "inclusive," they mean "exclusive"; when they say "multicultural,"
they mean "monocultural"; when they say "open-minded," they mean
"closed-minded"; and when they say "diversity," they mean "perversity."  But I
digress.  Really, tolerance in practice is simply indifference.  To tolerate
something is to be indifferent to it, meaning it does not threaten your person
or your way of life (which is nearly inseparable from your person) and holds no
interest to you.  This indifference, when applied to other humans, can be
miserable.  As Santayana pointed out: "[T]olerated people are never conciliated.
They live on, but the aroma of their life is lost."  If something threatens your
person or your way of life, no reasonable argument can be made that we should
tolerate it, to roll over and let it have its way with you, without resorting to
the fiction that the group is of higher worth than the individual.  Worth to
who?

Ira Brodsky wrote 9/23/96: <Here in the People's Republic of Wilmette (Illinois)
we constantly hear about the evils of "rigid facts" and "rote memorization" from
public school teachers.  Meanwhile, our kids are not being taught to spell, they
are not being taught basic math tables>

I commisserate.  Gray areas may be "tolerated" when they are of no consequence
to you, but when they translate into the conceptually incoherent relativism
being pumped into school children today, it would be irrational to "tolerate"
them.

Jeff again: <Or does it simply mean 'acknowledging that there is a degree of
uncertainty in all ideas, and dealing with that rationally'?>

It most certainly does not mean this, since many ideas are held with certainty,
that is, not a shred of doubt to them.

Jeff again: <Certainty comes in all shades of grey from black to white.>

Oh no, not this error again!  This topic has been beaten to death on this list
in the past, yet here it is again!  We must have reached St. Tipler's Omega
Point already.  The distinction between certainty and uncertainty is digital.
You are either certain or you are uncertain.  Look it up in the dictionary,
certainty means indubitable, without doubt.  Now unless you propose that we all
make up the meaning of words on the fly, to have dictionaries du jour, in which
case we would be nearly unintelligible to each other, let's stick to the
clarified meaning of certainty.  The instant you have a doubt about something,
you are uncertain.  There are different degrees of doubt, therefore, there are
different degrees of uncertainty, but there is only one degree of certainty.

Sasha wrote 9/20/96: <The more I think, the more I feel confused about
everything.>

We've suspected this about you for some time now, Sasha... <g>  Your statement
above is a good example of how "degrees of uncertainty" arise. One of Vico's
axioms from his "New Science" (1744) was "...as men are naturally drawn to the
pursuit of the true, their desire of it, when they cannot attain it, causes them
to cling to the certain."  He wrote: "Men who do not know what is true of things
take care to hold fast to what is certain, so that, if they cannot satisfy their
intellects by knowledge ('scienza'), their wills at least may rest on
consciousness ('coscienza')."  IOW, the more you think, the more uncertain you
are, but the more you will, the more certain you are.  If you'd stop thinking so
hard and start acting more, you'll be far less confused.

Dejan Vucinic wrote 9/24/96: <There are *no* fuzzy facts.  Instead, fuzziness
itself may be a fact of measurement or observation.  Vagueness means lack of

relevant of all mentioned to the word "fact.">

Ah, the voice of reason!  It is an exceedingly common error to mix up ontology
with epistemology, with what is there, facts, with what we can know about them,
our degrees of uncertainty, if you will.  Facts are facts, two things don't
happen at the same moment, only one thing does.  We may see it dimly, or from
different perspectives, but only one thing happens at any given instant of time.
This applies to history, only one thing happened at each historical moment, not
two or more.  Of course, I'm ignoring the solipsistic Many-Worlds nonsense.

Dejan again: <Is a rock more fundamental than number 1?>

Obviously.  Rocks preceded living entities capable of inventing the number 1,
which only has existence inside the said entity's brainpan.  "There is no valid
inference from mere possibility to matter of fact, or, in other words, from mere
mathematics to concrete nature." - Alfred North Whitehead, co-author of
"Principia Mathematica"

Dejan again: <So I must be out of this world since I'm spending months
studying errors of measurement in order to publish a paper about some
facts I measured in less than a week?>

On the face of it, yes.  Unless its part of some strange, esoteric initiation
rite you have to pass in order to put food on your table.  <g>

Robin Hanson wrote: <If there is any sensible distinction between observation
and experiment, it is in one's degree of control over a system.  Observers look,
while experimenters change things (and look).>

I see there's been further discussion since this, on the nature of experiments,
so I'll just add a tidbit about it.  I haven't seen the word "theory" come up
yet, so let me say that an experiment can't be an experiment without a theory
that not only predicts what will happen, but specifies what effects caused by
the experiment will count as evidence, before the experiment is conducted.
Observation, meaning no predictions are involved, still must have some theory
behind it, or else what is to be recorded as having been observed?  This gets to
the difficulty that the "soft" sciences have, as opposed to the "hard" sciences
that do not deal with anything living, let alone conscious entities capable of
theorizing themselves.  This difficulty is that theorizing about theorizing
entities, characterized by their unique volitional freedom, enters a
"meta-theorizing" regress, where what counts for evidence easily becomes fuzzy
depending on the shifting purposes of the experimenters and their reviewers.
Statistics are used because we are ignorant of the actual causes of the effects
we are observing (again, epistemology versus ontology). Rules for statistical
inference are set up strictly with utility in mind, which changes as the users
of the experiment's evidence change their purposes.  Studies coming out of this
domain, routinely are met with the question, "who funded this study?"

Such mish-mashy characteristics of the "soft" sciences have given rise to the
common and widespread charge that none of them are really "science," they are
just political programs to varying degrees.  This charge must be taken
seriously, because the "soft" sciences require funding, meaning they begin, and,
of course, end, in the political processes of whatever society is conducting
them.  Some political ends are better than others, e.g, the difference between
using nonliving things as means to an end and using humans as means to an end.
When statistics are applied to unique, individual humans, a mindset of viewing
them as an aggregate object (as in the "hard" sciences), an undifferentiated
mass, often develops; such a mindset is often passed on to corporate and
political elites who then frequently use humans in a nonliving sense, as
objects, as a means to their ends.  This is why the "soft" sciences have
gathered both a good reputation, as in medicine, and a bad reputation, as in
pschology.

An interesting treatment of the problem of theorizing about theorizers, is in
J.A. Scott Kelso's book "Dynamic Patterns" (1995) where he devoted a chapter to
"intentional dynamics," trying to model a coupled human intentional-behavioral
system, with mathematical predictions that, IMO, moved closer to the methods of
the "hard" sciences, than many other "soft" science experiments I have come
across, because the human subjects do not need to aggregated, they are
self-contained experimental universes.

I don't have any brilliant ideas about this in the short-term, but it's
starting to look pretty obvious to me that sooner or later we are going to
have a recognized profession of credential-creators. People whose ability
to judge work within a given field is fully recognized by practitioners of
that field and is generally recognized by people outside that field who
need to consume information produced by workers in that field.

This role has traditionally been played by institutions (schools, colleges,
journals, etc.) But as specialization accelerates, fields are coming into
existence for which there are only a few people capable of judging work
done in that field (over and above just *doing* work in that field). People
who work in these specialties have to figure out who these "de facto"
credential grantors are as their work proceeds... unless they feel no need
whatsoever for external validation of the quality of their own intellectual
work. There are lots of fields of work proceeding as we speak for which no
journal exists. They are managing to set their own standards somehow.
Eventually the practices they are evolving will develop into full-fledged
institutions.

Maybe someday there will be a few loosely recognized "professional
organizations" for the profession of credential-granting. The best analogy
I can think of for this future development that I'm thinking about is the
voluntary accrediting institutions that accredit schools in the United
States. It would be the same kind of thing, only they'd be accrediting
individual specialists, who would in turn endorse the work of people
working in that particular field. It's these endorsements by individual
credential-creators (probably with their digital signature) that you'd put
on your vita. Endorsement would probably be for specific pieces of work
done over specific periods of time, not carte-blanche endorsements of the
researcher as a person.

The potentials for abuse are stupendous. Here is a field ripe for those who
are interested in designing alternative institutions. As far as I can tell,
it'll be a matter of getting the design of the protocols right and leaving
room for the future improvement of those protocols. What do you think,
Robin? You've got a lot more expertise in this matter than I do.

(It's pretty obvious that my thinking on this is heavily influenced by the
"web of trust" ideas in the PGP documentation and related texts. But I'd
expect that of most of the other people on this list, even now.)

No it wouldn't, for reasons I've given several times --- production by
MNT does not require dependency on external means of production
except in very special cases.  Consequently, it happens *outside* of
the economy as we know it today, by definition, since there are no
economic links activated.

Something like this is deployed in Greg Egan's terrific sf story `Learning

Kathryn, the rise of fuzzy logic is not an excuse for mental sloppiness!
Fuzzy logic is every bit as formal and exacting as binary logic.  It's
not a free pass allowing every handwaver and charlatan to claim that he
has the backing of science and mathematics.  It deals with uncertain
facts very formally, and you can *NOT* claim the backing of Bart Kosko
if what you are trying to do is to manipulate uncertain facts sloppily.

Fuzzy logic *IS* a logic (ie. a mathematical formalism), not a charter
for denial of logic or mathematics.  Quite the opposite:  reasoning with
fuzzy sets is *AT LEAST* as precise as reasoning with 2-valued sets,
since it's a superset of binary logic, and often it is *MORE* precise
when used to describe the factual world because it allows reasoning with
real measured values instead of requiring those real values to be
approximated by zero or one, which would *lose* precision.

I think that you have misunderstood Kosko badly, possibly because of the
informal nature of his most popular paperback.  I suggest that you leaf
through one of his textbooks if you gained the impression that fuzzy
logic is not strict, formal, mathematical, and wonderfully more precise
than binary logic as a means of reasoning about the world.

Rich.

Well, I've tried twice now, but you still evade the point completely.
It's not just the products that will become easy and cheap to produce,
but the blinking MEANS OF PRODUCTION too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

-  What "retooling", when the tool is configured by software?  Indeed,
   what "tooling", when the basic assembler costs nothing?  (Ie. cost
   of development divided by infinite replication gives zero. :-)  The
   same cost breakdown that applies to products under MNT applies also
   to the in-situ "factories", except for very specialist products.

-  What "inventing", when 99.9999999999% of everything that people use
   or want is identical to that which their neighbours use or want?
   Yes, there will be some inventing of course, but it'll represent
   only a tiny fraction of post-nano activity, since the means of
   production will be freely available everywhere instead of localised
   only within industrial plants.

-  What "marketing", when the whole costs/profit basis of current-day
   economics is virtually shattered when dependence on commercial means
   of production disappears almost entirely?  Bespoke production will
   of course remain, along with many other types of production such as
   those requiring very odd raw materials or high energy input, but I
   don't see any role at all for what today is the underpinning of the
   economic system, namely food/clothing/chemical/energy/finance/housing/
   vehicle/computer/software/etc production.

So far, Robin, you just haven't tackled the impact of MNT affecting also
the near-zero cost and universal availability of the *means of production*
once nanotech becomes public.  Until you do, you will continue to get the
wrong answers from your forecasts, because if the means of production stay
in factories as today then obviously it's still "business as usual".

        Hmmm.  I wonder if I could simplify this even more:

        Cling to facts...but also cling to the things other than facts.  I
think it would be a positively boring world if everything was facticious.
Reality (and I hope no-one asks "But what is reality?") is that right now,
we are human.  That is a fact unto itself.  Being human allows us to see
around the facts.  In fact <g>, that is one of the only qualities I adore in
humans:
the fact that we can see more than facts.

Well, in that case there's nothing to discuss.  By your same reasoning
of course, biological nanotech doesn't exist either, since all those
little organisms that totally pervade the biosphere must have AI and
be directable by you to do anything useful, right? :-)

[I must say, I doubt if I've ever seen a funnier thought experiment than
the one in which you extrapolate from directors of corporations down to
nanomachines.  Reasoning by analogy is known to be weak of course, but
that example turned it into an artform. :-)]

I don't know how you reached this idea that nanomachines need to be AIs,
but it seems to have no basis in reality as far as I can see.  Today's
software packages are immensely more complicated than a basic assembler,
yet they do their job very well without being AIs.  As written all over
the place, the first generation of programmable nanomachines is expected
to be controlled remotely by traditional computers, so the nanomachines
can be really dumb, ie. essentially just a nanoscale N/C machine.
Subsequent generations will get smarter of course, but "smart" is a
very relative concept;  for the kind of assembly that most of us are
discussing, all that is needed is fairly primitive state machines for
sequencing and neural networks for recognition --- no AI needed.

IAN: I agree not, let's see what we got:
        _______
        |  __  |
        |  |_| |
        |______| 

According to Kosko, the subset (small box) above 
contains the Superset (large box) by, oh, 25%.

But this conclusion rests upon a big assumption,
which is brought to light with the question: 
which area is the * inside * of the subset?

Here we need a rule, for example:

     The inside of the subset is the 
     area that contains all that it is.

This is a rule I've tested and uniform agreement
have found, though we may shift words around. 
Now let's run it again:

     The inside of the subset is the 
     area that contains all that it is.
     But all that it is, is all that its not.

Hot is not-cold, tall is not-short, big is not-small

     Likewise: subset is not-Superset. 
     Thus, the Superset is a necessary 
     part of what the subset is.

As Rich aptly stated, "A subset contains ITS 
superset..." This "its" expresses the logical 
fact that the Superset is a *part* of the subset, 
which describes containment. So let's rap this up:

     (1) If the inside of the subset 
     contains all that it is, and 

     (2) if a part of what it is, is 
     all that it's not, 

     (3) then the subset contains 
     the Superset by 100%.

Thus it is logical to state that the inside 
is everywhere, and that the two (subset and 
Superset) are two yet not-two. This is the 
antithesis of  Aristotelian law, but where 
is the error? where is the flaw ?

This is no spoof.
I still await disproof.

I agree. I once said to Bart (or maybe it was in my Extropy #12 review of
the book) that I thought it unfortunate that this approach came to be called
"fuzzy logic" rather than, say, many-valued logic. The word "fuzzy"
sometimes seems to invite abuse of the idea.

I'm having lunch with Bart Kosko tomorrow and will mention the current
discussion. He's a busy busy guy, but perhaps he may read and respond to
some of the messages, especially the criticism of the passage quoted.

IAN: I recall this. Obviously this FBI official knew better, he had 
to be aware of the fact that investigators were discovering many 
missile witnesses. Yet, the FBI official is at the same time sending 
a powerful "social signal" that "wrong thinking" is a sign of mental

Right there we have an example of a source for the social ideation 
that serious questioning of the govt-line is a sign of mental illness, 
which in turn is a sign of perhaps the need of being locked up in the 
lunny bin. An idea not endirsed by the state = a sign of insanity.

Such social ideation, which results in social alienation, is a 
powerful disincentive for independent investigation and questioning 
of authority. It's a Soviet style method of tarring anti-authoritarians 
as inherently insane, ergo: ignore them or at worst lock them up. It 
works very effectively, as almost anyone who's ever broached a 
conspiracy theory regarding govt activities can attest.

I had a discussion today with a colleague that started with
some Dennett's statements on serial nature of consciousness.
Checking The Source ("Consciousness Explained"):
"... [ Human consciousness] is largely a product of cultural
evolution that gets imparted to brains in early training".

So consciousness evolved with, and *for*, exchange of experiences
and ideas in social interaction.  To share some information on
personal experiences, and derived conclusions, one needs to
generalize it beyond just personal experience, and express it in
some transportable and common representation.  The necessary
machinery for such operations plays the role of social interface
software - no wonder that we have clear terms for our social roles,
and not even basic observer access to the internal brain functions.
The architecture of this interface software should be optimized for
the hardware - body structure - available for expressing things.
Now, here is something that I just noticed.  Human bodies didn't have
any built-in specialized knowledge output devices, and couldn't build
any.  So they had to signal with whatever organs they had.  And these
organs did not happen to allow much in terms of parallel output.
So, though most of the brain functions are parallel, and so are the
biological sensors - which makes both ideal for accepting parallel data
- the outputs were serial, and so most knowledge inputs were also
serial - and so the processes for handling them had to be built to the
serial specifications.

  I wonder what kind of consciousness we would develop if we had a
parallel output device - e.g., have the skin surface work as a hi-res
display.

I'm going to call this idea Extropian Nanotech.  

As a first step towards calibration of this idea, try comparing it 
with other processes that are similar in some ways:   

- a termite colony building an ant hill
- an orange tree growing an orange 
- a cedar tree growing wood to be used for lumber 
- a water purification plant, in which bacteria remove 
       certain contaminants from the water
- an electric eel generating an electric potential 
- a firefly generating light 
- a cicada generating sound 

These analogies calibrate Extropian Nanotech only in the sense that they 
all involve replicating organisms producing various effects.  All these 
analogies are missing something -- the idea of a system that can do 
everything at once, in one place.  The following hypothetical projects 
are a closer calibration for Extropian Nanotech:  

- an entomologist creating general-purpose (reprogrammable) termites, 
       which could build any kind of building (or tunnel, etc), to spec.
- a biologist creating a general-purpose (reprogrammable) 
        orchard, which would grow all kinds of fruit in a small space.
- a biologist creating a general-purpose (reprogrammable) 
        tree, which would grow any specified kind of wood 
- a biologist creating a general-purpose (reprogrammable) 
        hydroponic garden, which would grow all the food for a household 
- a biologist creating a general-purpose filter, using bacteria, fungi, 
        and/or green plants, to take any ion out of any solution
- a biologist creating a general purpose energy-generating organism, 
        which can produce whatever kind of energy you need -- 
        light, electricity, sound, heat, etc.  

Now we have gotten a very good calibration; what I have just described 
is almost isomorphic to Extropian Nanotech.  If you ponder these 
projects slowly enough to get them in focus, you can get an excellent 
idea of what is going to be involved in Extropian Nanotech.  

How much would you have to know about termites, their society, 
their genome, etc., before you could make them reprogrammable and 
able to build structures to spec?  How long would this take?  Whatever 
the answer is, Extropian Nanotech will require about the same time, 
because it amounts to the same thing.  Nanites may not physically 
resemble termites, but they will have a genome that will be comparable 
to the genome of a termite, and their society will be as complex as a 
termite colony.  Creating nanites is isomorphic to creating 
reprogrammable termites.  Everything that has to be done in one case 
has to be done in the other.  

Likewise for all the other projects on the list.  What would be involved 
in creating a general purpose energy-generating organism?  How long 
would this take?  Extropian Nanotech will take that long, too, because 
you will have to do something that amounts to the same thing.  
You will have to find ways to generate all kinds of energy at the 
atomic level, and incorporate these mechanisms into replicating entities.  
Your task is isomorphic to the biologist's task.  

However, your task requires another step that the biologist 
doesn't have to worry about:  instead of modifying existing organisms 
and their cellular machinery to make materials, generate electricity, 
and so forth, you are going to use atomic machinery invented de novo, 
based on Eric Drexler's diamondoid constructors and replicators.  
You have to do that before you can even start the higher-level projects 
discussed above.  

Thus, to create Extropian Nanotechnology, you have to do everything 
the biologists have to do in the projects listed above, *plus* design a 
new kind of replicating entity, and all the necessary atomic machinery.   

The last step in calibration is to write a computer simulation of 
Extropian Nanotechnology.  Instead of actually moving carbon atoms 
into their places in a diamondoid structure, you move simulated atoms 
from place to place in memory, and watch this happening on the 
monitor.  Everything that happens in a complete Home Nanotech 
Facility is represented in the simulation.  This means both atomic level 
processes, and also higher level processes, such as nanites making a 
tunnel, or a tree reprogramming itself to produce oak instead of 
cedar wood.  Everything described in the biology projects listed above, 
plus all the new diamondoid machinery, is simulated.  The retooling 
mentioned by Dan Clemmenson is also simulated.  If any part of the 
nanosystem is going to be evolved, rather than designed, that process of 
evolution is also simulated.  

If you imagine writing the code required for the Nanotech simulation, 
you have a very good calibration of the Nanotech project itself.

Hyperchess is orders of magnitude easier than the Nanotech simulation.  
At some point in the Nanotech project, you are going to have to write 
software, similar to a CAD program, to help you design atomic structures.  
This will be more or less isomorphic to hyperchess.  This is just 
one little part of the whole project, something I didn't even bother to 
mention in my discussion above.

Loathe as I am to get in to this, the flaw's in 'subset is not-superset'.
Not true. 'Subset is not-100%-superset' is true, or, at the very least, useful.

Oh, hang on...

"But all that it is, is all that its not."

Is also a flaw. If the redness of a box is contrasted with the not-redness
of everything else, that does _not_ make the box not-red. And the same can
be said of every single feature of the box, so all that the box is, is _not_
all that the box is not.

We've had this conversation before, so I'm fairly sure I won't convince you
(anybody else wanna shout for my corner?), but you continue to suggest a
binary is/is-not pairing and then suddenly assert that each member of that
pairing is the same, invalidating your own pair-dichotomy. Huh?

This sets the little cogwheels in my head in motion... What about the
means of producing the means of production? A nanoassembler can build an
identical nanoassembler, just as a robot factory could build another, but
they would be qualitatively similar. Building a better or different
assembler (for use in space, the bloodstream or in the atmosphere of
Jupiter, or based on silicon instead of carbon) would require some work
and expertise. 

If assemblers are general enough to produce just about everything needed 
in a certain environment (like the exotic surface of the Earth) new 
assemblers isn't needed (but then again, why do we write new compilers 
and computer languages all the time when they are all essentially 
equivalent?). But up until that point the means of producing new means of 
production are very important; my guess is that they will supercede the 
means of production in importance quite soon after nanotechnology becomes 
really useful, up until the point where it can do everything everyone 
wants. 

One could look at even higher levels of "means of producing the means 
of...", but what we are essentially seeing here is a level of 
metaengineering, where the goal is to develop better ways to reach goals. 
Quite similar and synergetic to self-augmentation, which is the same 
process applied to intelligent systems.

Well, controlling something random is of course only partially possible, 
unless you can use random correlations to do clever things (like the 
essentially random states of quantum computers interfering with each 
other to produce a real result). I personally think control is overrated, 
as Kelly pointed out it is very much an industrial age word and may not 
be as central in the information or nano age.

The big question is: can we do something useful with something that 
exists just as probabilities? It seems so; quantum computers and 
statistics are obviously useful.

The universe has no obligation to be reassuring.

Nope. A lot of tolerance involves 'putting up with' something which does
affect your way of life, and which you are not indifferent to. One may
tolerate having a low wage because one loves one's job, but that doesn't
mean indifference towards being paid a low wage. One may tolerate a straight
flat-mate's lover, because of respect for the freedoms of that flat-mate,
but that doesn't imply an indifference to heterosexuality. (Sorry, couldn't
resist that twist :-) Etc... Hence the OED definition 'endure', 'endure with
forbearance', etc.

>This indifference, when applied to other humans, can be
>miserable.  As Santayana pointed out: "[T]olerated people are never
conciliated.
>They live on, but the aroma of their life is lost."

I agree that 'toleration' has an intrinsic connotation of 'otherness'; and
that conciliation requires an overcoming of the feelings of 'forbearance'
which are required to satify a definition of toleration. But note that this
supports my argument above: if toleration equated to indifference,
conciliation would be unecessary.

Again no. In both my examples above, toleration is based on the balancing of
feelings of the individual, for hir own personal happiness. These are
personal decisions based on personal feelings, they do not require recourse
to the concept of group-worth. That, of course, does not mean that you or I
or others have to agree with a person's choice to tolerate, but then, none
of us has to agree to anything, do we? 

It's not a question of a threat to the person or to one's way of life,
that's too simplistic. It's to do with the nature of that threat, and a
personal balancing of priorities and desires.

Practically (and I'm a practical kinda gal) I think this is true. There are
probably deep epistomological debates to be had in this area, but I ain't
gonna start them.

Yep.

Question: is time continuous or discrete? I thought time was quantum in
nature, with the minimum possible interval of time being related to Planck's
constant (h/2pi?). But I only dimly remember reading that, and I can't find
the reference, so I may be wrong (which I'm quite willing to accept). If I'm
right, then more than one thing can happen at any given instant of time.

I'm assuming the reply here based around the <g> rather than a serious

I don't believe theories predict what will happen, they only predict what
might happen. Otherwise they wouldn't be theoretical.

To say observation needs a theory behind it is not true. Observation often
leads to discovery: it is an error of causality to say observation _must_
have some theory behind it; it is quite possible for the theory to evolve
from the observation. The theory, and the validity of that theory, may, of
course, be refined and checked by further observation and/or experiment.

Anders is responding to your post! :-)

I think it is hard to start a discussion of this based just on HAARP, you 
have to broaden the subject a bit to include other forms of climate 
engineering, like seeding the seas with iron to cause algae blooms, 
modifying albedo, "butterfly control" and causing/inhibiting cloud 
formation. If you do this, I think you will get more people involved and 
a higher likeliehood of creating a "critical mass" for the thread.

Hackers are explorers.  Computer hackers try see and access "new" 
data, usually this data has been restricted.  This is a lovely 
analogy for the brain - the brain hackers mission: To go where no one 
has gone before.  One problem with brain hacking is that the 
protocols are obscure and there are no useful maps of the system 
to be hacked.  What is needed is a Hackers Guide to the Human Mind.  
This could use dream interpretation and symbols to give the would be 
hacker a map to work with while in an "altered state of 
consciousness".

The only "guided tour" through the human mind I've found is Tim 
Leary's "Tibetan book of the dead" which is a session to be talked 
through while on LSD. 
Do you know of any other attemps like this ?

But what does the chimeras think about their lives? Suppose you awaken in 
a paradise of your liking, with a benevolent Omega-point "angel" telling 
you that you have been resurrected by the Omega Universal Immortalism 
Institute (OUII) - but that you may or may not be a new being that never 
existed in this universe, or a perfect emulation of your old self. There 
is no way anyone (not even Omega) can tell which. Would you think you are 
a chimera, the Real Thing (tm) or vaciliate?

Of course, Tipler is an adherent to the Many Worlds Interpretation, and 
would say there are no chimeras, just people being resurected in 
different worldlines from their original worldlines.

No, that would be the (hoped for) result after resurrection - if Omega 
would rewise the resurrected beings before they were emulated, it could 
as well make them up.

Just my $.02:  One of the primary elements of my work is trying to uncover
the "truth" from eyewitness accounts, usually of unexpected and
extraordinary, often violent events.  From my experience (1) perception and
memory in such situations is extremely unreliable, even in disinterested
witnesses, (2) mutliple witnesses can influence each other's perceptions and
memories subtly but very strongly, (3) strongly-held "memories" "mutate"
significantly over time and (4) all of these factors seem to be even more
significant regarding events that happen at night.  I can't offer systematic
documentation for these assertions, but most folks who do what I do for a
living will agree, I think.

No real hackers rely on the documentation! ;-)

The problem is that symbols are highly variable, even if some have more 
standardized meanings (After all, most psychologists and anthropologists 
do not buy Jung's theories). I think a more reliable map would be based 
on the hardware - it is more standardized, and can be accessed in a more 
replicable way. A third possibility is to build a symbolic system, which 
is then used to influence the mind; this is the solution of ceremonial 
magick.

But that's the way that the world (er, universe) is.  Or are you suggesting

No, we cannot see more than facts.  Our perceptions don't pop into 
existence out of nowhere.  Even hallucinations have some root physical 
cause.  At most, we can *imagine* (not 'see') non-existent things, and 
we can draw erroneous conclusions about things we do see.  Imagination 
is a wonderfully useful tool, but I have a problem with characterizing it as 
'seeing things that aren't facts'.  It's nothing more than the ability to 
construct hypothetical models - an ability that any thinking being will 
need to have, not just us adorable humans.

I don't understand why that's important. There might be a huge number of 
"phony" John Clarks running around with vivid memories of things that never 
happened, but I don't care as long as I'm there too.

As long as the Omega Point could perform an infinite number of computations 
and not just an astronomically large number (two very different concepts), 
I don't see why it couldn't emulate you and all your experiences. Even finite 
brute force can accomplish a lot if you give it enough time, it did after all
produce life. If the brute force process has access to a computer that can  
perform an infinite number of computations then coming up with you and me,  
and every conceivable variation of you and me, would be trivially easy for it 
to do.

Why isn't that a Markov chain? Any knowledge other than knowledge of a 
system's present state will not help you make a better prediction on what 
state the system will be in next, and that's a Markov chain. The system's 
history, how it got to its present state, is not important. Yes you can have 
random inputs, but that's just another way of saying not every effect has a 
cause and Markov chains can certainly handle that. Except for the trivial 
case where all probabilities are equal to one, Markov chains are not 
deterministic but stochastic.
                          

                >We are not Markov chains because we have memory
                          

If I have a memory then the present physical state of my brain is different 
than it would be if I did not have that memory and it could be important in 
determining the probability of what physical state it will be in next, 
in other words what my next thought will be. If I once had a memory but now 
have totally forgotten it, both consciously and unconsciously, then that
information will not help you figure out what I will do next, you can only 
look at my present state and then play the odds.    
                          

                >AND we can plan ahead.
                           

We can invent theories about what the most probable future will be, but there  
is no reason a Markov chain can't do that.
                       

                >Even if A SINGLE entity can be IN only a finite number of

                >number of TOTAL states that an entity can choose from.
                       

If I can only be in N states then whatever state I'm going to be in next it 
must be one of those N states. A 10 bit computer memory chip can be in 2^10  
sates, regardless of what happens when all is said and done, that chip will  
always be in one of those 2^10 states. I think using a word like "choose" 
just muddies the waters.

> I don't know how you reached this idea that

That's not what I said.  

A nanomachine per se does not have to be an AI.  

Any system, nano or macro, capable of creating a pipeline, will contain 
within it many human-level intelligences.  Any system, nano or macro, 
capable of producing the variety of goods produced by the American 
economy or the Japanese economy, will contain within it approximately 
a hundred million human-level intelligences.  

In a complex construction project, such as creating a pipeline, there are 
many points at which a decision has to be made which requires human 
judgment.  In other words, whoever makes this decision has to 
understand the whole project, and the purpose of his present task within 
the project.  He has to understand what he is doing in terms of a causal 
model of the world, which is what I mean by human-level intelligence.  
At present, such decisions are made by human beings.  In the future, 
they may be made by robots with AI.  But the same decisions that 
have to be made now will still have to be made in the future, and these 
decisions will still require a mind with a causal model of the world.  

In last night's post, about how to calibrate the idea of Extropian 
Nanotech, I carefully avoided assuming anything about AI.  
I assumed that all decisions requiring human judgment would be made 
by humans, either in the design stage, or in the production stage.  
However, this does not affect the point made above:  the same decisions 
that are made now will still have to be made in an economy based on 
Extropian Nanotech, and those decisions will still require human 
judgment.

Assuming we ever hit the bottom (no evidence of such to date), why not move
on to researching the more complex, as opposed to more fundamental?  Plenty
of space to grow.

Ouch.  Every time I see a statement like this I'm painfully reminded how
difficult it is to articulate QM in plain english.  But what the heck,
I'll give it another try: it's no good thinking of the Universe *existing*
as probabilities.  Quantum mechanics describes not the existence of
reality, but its observed behavior.  It's a MODEL, just that.  Describing
"quantum world" in terms of "probability" is futile.  Quantum world, if
you chose to "believe" in it, is more fundamental than the probability.
The probabilistic nature is not inherent in the MODEL, it's a consequence
of the measurement, by which we obtain information about the workings of
the Universe.  You don't describe the more fundamental in terms of the less
fundamental.  It would be like trying to explain the q/r model of
electrostatic potential in terms of why things don't fall apart.  It's
just the other way around; this way it's a non-question.

(Sheesh, look at that paragraph.  No matter how hard one tries, it's
still a formidable didactic puzzle.  Many briliaant students have spent
years trying to "understand" QM.  What a waste.)

>It seems so; quantum computers and 
>statistics are obviously useful. 

Yes, we can put it to work.  And it doesn't matter whether it's a 
complete theory or not, as long as it works (to us experimentalists, at
least :).

Beautiful.  Straight into my quote-file.

An ordinary journal signals quality (or lack of) by its history.  With time,
this on-line publication system will be recognized as quality (or not).   I
think the requirement of application to join is a safeguard.  Applications
can be verified.  "Recognized" names of people doing the peer review might
help if they join. 

The peer review I have been involved with is not as good as this proposal
because the reviewers were chosen poorly.  They did not even know my subject.
 And, I was chosen to review some far way areas which I sent to people who
_did_ know the subject.  At least I notified the editor and got approval to
do this.  Some people I sure have not.  Will this on-line system be any
better?

Currently anonymous reviewers are chosen.  Do you think this is good?  How do
you know _their_ quality even in an ordinary journal?  I've seen terrible
articles published in highly respected journals.  Without knowing the
reviewers, I can say they must have been very poor or they passed the article
off but to lesser qualified people.  The system we have now is the problem.
 Anyone can "pass off" a review to another reviewer.  Will the on-line system
prevent this with PGP signatures?

The main reason I like peer review is: To make me think about what the
reviewers have said.  Therefore, I improve my publication.  This works in
many cases but I would like more views of my work.  I think the on-line
system will do this better than what I have now.

          Dan Clemmensen has suggested that SIs don't colonise cosmos 
          because of their high discount rate for future benefits. The 
          discount rate would presumably be high because of the 
          rapidity of their subjective time and the slowness of cosmic 
          travels. The idea is interesting since, if right, it would 
          help resolve the Fermi paradox.
          
          One reason why SIs could have a high discount rate would be 
          if they had a bias towards the near future, just as we 
          humans have. We tend to care more about an imminent pleasure 
          than about a similar one we would sure to get in a billion 
          years. Perhaps all SIs would be "irrational" in the same 
          way?
          
          Another reason why an SI might discount the benefits of 
          colonisation is because they would only come about if it 
          diverted some of its resources to the space mission, 
          resources which could have been used for other purposes. 
          Suppose that the objective of the SI is to maximise the 
          amount of valuable computations it will carry out during its 
          life time. At a certain time t it has a given capital 
          (consisting perhaps of its mass or available energy). Part 
          of this capital could be invested into a project that would 
          yield returns at t'>t, but meanwhile that capital could not 
          be used to make valuable computations, i.e. there would be 
          an opportunity cost which would have to be subtracted from 
          the expected returns when considering whether the investment 
          is worthwhile. The question is what the function 
          f=valuablecomputationspower(capital) looks like. For 
          Clemmensen's argument to go through, it would not suffice 
          that f had a jerk at some point, because different SIs would 
          presumably start out with somewhat different amounts of 
          capital. If all SI had originally a capital less that the 
          critical amount, then they would invest in space missions, 
          but the benefit of space missions seems to come in chunks 
          (one chunk for every planet or solar system one arrived at), 
          and so there would be some overshoot: most SIs would obtain 
          a capital greater than the critical value, and they would 
          have little to lose from using the excess for new space 
          missions. f would rather have to have the shape of an 
          inverted exponential, so that for each amount of capital 
          (greater than some start-up value), a slight loss of capital 
          would reduce the computation power greatly, whereas a slight 
          increase would bring but a negligible increase. Not only 
          would the function have to be of an exponential character, 
          the constants would have to be rather great, considering 
          that the gains would be obtained after perhaps a thousand 
          years and be enjoyed for perhaps billions of years, while 
          the required investment would presumably be very small 
          compared to the SI's total capital whereas the gains could 
          be very substantial. For instance, if any considerable 
          degree of parallelization of valuable computations were 
          possible, then df/d(capital) would certainly not decrease 
          rapidly enough.
          
          If Robin's objection, that not all knowledge can be obtained 
          simply by sitting back and think (making computations), is 
          directed against Clemmensen's basic idea rather than against 
          some other more specific claim Clemmensen has made, then I 
          don't think it carries very much weight, because there is no 
          obvious reason why SIs should be interested in the detailed 
          structure of distant cosmic regions. We must not forget that 
          a mere suggestion for where the Great Filter could be, even 
          if it falls short of being a proof, would be very helpful; 
          in any case there seem to be much greater difficulties with 
          Clemmensen's proposal than that it assumes that the 
          curiosity of SIs is rather limited.

Yep, happens to me too. Looking at the block in Notepad produces a lot of
gobbledegook which includes the title and, near the beginning,
"IPM.Microsoft Mail.Note 1", so I guess it's the mail system your using.

I'll say this one last time.  These are just baldface claims, which
you have not bothered to argue for.  I've had a nice conversation with
Dan Clemmensen, who is willing to offered arguments for things, and to
address holes in those arguments once they are pointed out to him.
You, on the other hand, don't appear to understand what an persuasive
argument is.  So I would rather not converse with you.

Yes it is a ripe field for innovation.  Therefore it is not obvious to
me that your solution of professional credentialors will win or is best.
Until you can describe an attractive plausible design along your
lines, I will think the game is still quite open.

Poor choice of reviewer is not intrinsic to the current process, and
evolutionary selection of journals should prefer those with
editors who pick reviewers who will pick articles their readers like.

I have since learned that this online journal idea lets reviewers post
numerical ratings, which are averaged into a paper rating.  But since
anyone can review anything, I don't have great hopes for the average
quality of high-rated articles.  But it is an empirical question.

Bipedalism may be slow, but it made us the most efficient runners on the
planet.
Humans can outrun and outlast any other running animal. Two men can run
down and
exhaust any other grazing mammal. Team hunting by running down prey is
called
cursorial hunting, like wolves do.

Surely it depends on the kind of model being used. IMHO, diffusing
chemical
signals will have to be part of such models, and many of them might be
easily
edited...

More fascinating is that the possible variety of such simulated drug
experiences
would vastly exceed what can be done with physical molecules. Check out
PIKHAL by
Alesander Shulgin which is a fascinating account of what has been done
with molecules...

In High School English class one day (about 1961) there was a huge
debate about
"is there a God" into which I made the above suggestion. Of course
nobody had a

Yup, but the access rules seem a bit funky and very poorly designed.
Where is
that "soul" icon on my display screen??

To misstate some of the philosphers who feel that consciousness is an

Apparently shutting off MIME fixed the problem completely in direct 
person-to-person email, but only partially fixed it on the list.  This 
time I'm using Netscape instead of Windows Exchange, again with MIME 
disabled.  If this doesn't clear it up, I'll go harass my network 
administrator.  Please let me know if this post still has extra junk 
tacked onto the end.  Sorry for the trouble.

Regarding brain maps for hackers:

Greg Bear's _Queen of Angels_ proposes just such a system for exploring the 
subconscious. Dubbed "the country of the mind," computers symbolically map 
experiences, emotions, biases, memories, etc into a virtual world that is 
explored by psychologists seeking to solve a crime.

The book is generally extro-friendly, featuring wide-spread nano, common 
physical and mental enhancements, birth of an AI, and an all-too-rare optimistic 
view of the future. The attempt to scientifically justify the "country of the 
mind" angle is weak, IMHO.

A good read.

Excellent. Thanks for taking care of this problem. I do have another
suggestion for improving the archive. Currently, the entire archive is on a
single web page which makes it cumbersome to load and read.  A separate web
page with recent posts - say the last week or two weeks - would be
desirable.  The cypherpunk archive has a separate page of this type.  See
http://infinity.nus.sg/cypherpunks/.  If you are able to make a change of
this type it would be appreciated by archive readers in general I believe.

This is a good description of the the disscussion Robin and I are
having. I'd like ot clarify a few points, however.

1) I do not really believe SI's will act as I have described. I believe
that
SI's motivations are incomprehensible to us. I was, as you suggested,
trying
to examine one possible element of the "great filter". Your points deal
with
the liklihood that this element is important. The actual filter is the

More later. I have to go do a kid taxi run.

A wonderful book.  When I reviewed it in Australia, I praised Bear's use of
up to date cog sci. and was somewhat abashed when I met him a few months
later and he explained that the `country of mind' is grounded firmly in
Jung, and is a notion he'd been developing independently (on that basis)
since he was a teenager...

IAN: "If we say it's so, it must be so. The * inside * of the subset
is the area I say it is, no logical rule is necessary." I reject
this truth by decree. I founded my conclusion on a rule:

        The inside of the box is the area 
        that contains all that it is.

Even better:

        The inside of the box is that area
        that contains all those features 
        necessary for its specific identity.        

You've not shown me a red box that is what it is free from its 
external area. Thus your claim of nonholistic identity, stands
as a myth. Should physical verification be the basis of our
belief or should truth by decree be our standard ?

But alas, I believe our differnece may be semantical. That's
why I've made a rule for inclusion so as to reduce wheel spinning.

IAN: Just as this thing > * < has no identity apart from its external 
area, the red box has no identity apart from its external area. Therefore 
its external area is * inside * the area that contains all those features
necessary for its identity. I've just unified the red box to the universe 
that you errantly assume you've removed it from.

Furthermore, the red box is "big," "small," "common," "rare," "bright,"
"dark," .... only relative to other items its external area.

While you've not identified a single feature of the red box that 
is derived exclusively from its internal area. I've presented many 
examples of externally derived features. Can you find even a single 
feature of the red box that is derived free from external relation ? 
If not, how do you sustain your claim to nonrelational identity ?


  > We've had this conversation before, so I'm fairly sure I won't

IAN: I stubbornly stick to physical verification as the basis for 
belief. I am still waiting for an example, physical or conceptual, 
of a nonrelational identity. Until I have it, I'll believe that 
identity is holistic and thus the whole universe is the inside 
of the red box. Others can base their belief on whatever 
standard they choose, I'll stick to physical verification.

IAN: If differnece (two or more features) is the basis for a single 
identity (one thing), then the thing is this difference, and thus 
is all those things from which this difference is derived. Your 
assuming that I deny difference, I do not. Difference is the
basis of what Iam saying. It's a perfect paradox, difference
implies holist unity, implies same, or identity.

IAN: I can't cite documentation, but a pilot of another plane
said that he was flying at 10,000 feet and looked down to see 
the TWA plane explode. While from that we should assume that 
TWA flight 800 was under 10,000 ft, I am not sure how the
specific 7,600 ft was concluded by the author above.

Also, if the FBI falsified the altitude to be higher than it 
was, that tends to rule out a terrorist hit and puts the plane
in the "maybe the Navy hit it" altitude. Thus, such a falsification
seems to back-fire for the govt in this respect. ??  Of course, if 
they can just say, "It's crazy to say the Navy hit it," and the 
case is closed with everyone believing it, then it's a good 
move as it rules out any missile hit by fabrication & bluff.

A modern microprocessor is very complex, yet we can manufacture millions of

We design a microprocessor only once, then we can stamp out millions of them. 
                          
We know for sure that it's possible to manufacture extremely complex objects, 
like human beings, in a process that needs no intelligence in the construction 
process at all; it only needs the correct digital information (messenger RNA), 
energy (ATP) and simple raw materials (amino acids). There is no reason we
can't make a machine that does as well or better than natures machine, unless 
you think life has some mystical vital force that we could never presume to 
understand.

My apologies to Nicholas Bostrom and Dan Clemmensen... 
but I was curious to see what this post would look like if you substitute 
"corporation" for "SI" throughout.  Does it still make sense?    
What exactly is the difference between a corporation and an SI?

I've tried to figure out which of various possible meanings you intended,
but English is hopeless for this task.  As you're good at formalisms,
could you try to make your argument more formally, and in particular,
indicate where you're using fuzzy sets and where 2-valued sets?

Needless to say, you should *expect* to arrive at contradictions and
paradoxes if you are reducing an argument expressed in fuzzy set theory
into another based on traditional logic --- Bertrand Russell showed
that very clearly.  I worked a lot with higher-order functions and
typed objects while doing research on concurrent object-oriented purely
functional languages, and I used to come across this sort of problem
all the time.  It's a good thing that people are beginning to show some
will to drop political correctness in maths at long last and look at more
powerful formalisms, as it's been an annoying bugbear for a long time.

Cheers,

Rich.

Ian, what _are_ you talking about? I'm not saying it's separate from its
external area, merely that it's internal area is part of the superset. It's
external area is _not_, as you claim, the entire superset. How can it be? If
the area of the subset were not part of the superset it would not be a subset!

I _do_ wish you'd pay attention to what I'm saying, and not then start
accusing me of disagreeing with the very thing I _do_ agree with. I agree
with everything you've said above (although size brings up interesting
questions).

But the following sentence is a _complete_ nonsense:

"But all that it is, is all that its not."

OK: it's red. So apply that sentence:

"It is red. It is not red."

OK: it's small. So apply that sentence:

"It is small. It is not small."

And so on.

Your theory is fine, and I hate to be so blunt, but it's just that you use
mathematical and grammatical structures to try and desribe it which entirely
fail to do so from any logical or semantic perspective.

Sarah

                The Ten Truths of Tyranny
                        by
                Matt Giwer (c) 1994 <9/30

1)  Any law the electorate sees as being open to being perverted from its
original intent will be perverted in a manner that exceeds the manner of
perversion seen at the time.

2)   Any law that is so difficult to pass it requires the citizens be
assured it will not be a stepping stone to worse laws will in fact be a
stepping stone to worse laws.

3)   Any law that requires the citizens be assured the law does not mean
what the citizens fear, means exactly what the citizens fear.

4)   Any law passed in a good cause will be interpreted to apply to
causes against the wishes of the people.

5)   Any law enacted to help any one group will be applied to harm people
not in that group.

6)   Everything the government says will never happen will happen.

7)   What the government says it could not foresee, the government has
planned for.

8)   When there is a budget shortfall to cover non-essential government
services the citizens will be given the choice between higher taxes or
the loss of essential government services.

9)   Should the citizens mount a successful effort to stop a piece of
legislation the same legislation will be passed under a different name.

10)  All deprivations of freedom and choice will be increased rather than
reversed.
                        # # #
     A government is a tyranny when it sets itself above the will and
judgement of the people and refuses to comply with the wishes of the
people.

     A government is a tyranny when it lies to the people to get what it
wants.

     A government is a tyranny when the traditional rights of the people
are treated as obstacles to the objectives of government.

     A government is a tyranny when it creates animosities among the
people.

     A government is a tyranny when it blames the people for not stopping
it from acting against the wishes of the people.

	Ever hear of the Gulf of Tonkin, the Lusitania, WWI, the Federal

outwitting enough of the population to get their way.

	Perhaps you are one of those being outwitted?

That was my point. Trying to find rational reasons for why we do things 
is a cheap rationalization ;) . There are none. Ultimatively, this is a 
hardware function. It does what it was designed to do (by the Blind 
Watchmaker), no more, no less. (Admit some random factor for GA 
optimization).

Assuming everything else is just a case of antromorphism.

This assumes that happiness does exist. (Ok, it probably does ;) What 
one can do, is to define a happiness metric. This would require e.g. 
statistically evaluated polling, and clearly it gives us no a priori 
clue, which future trajectory from countless possible to select to land in 
an alternative world with the max integrated happiness. This would require 
future models, which are progressively inaccurate if not altoghether 
questionable.

Another arbitrary assumption would be how to distribute happiness. 
Equidistributed? Weighted? Does one integrate over population? Over time? 
Both?

One could define a life metric, at least a boolean one. Since life is a 
complex phenomenon, it would be somewhat context (observer) dependant.

Extropy is not a formal concept. It was never intended to be one. 
Information/entropy can be measured, though.

If one wants to define objective reality as something having the same 
impact on different individua (of course it can't, since no one can 
occupy the same voxel region of spacetime, but most of them are quite 
dull, anyway), yes.

I think we can quite assume existance of the outside being an axiom. 
Everybody not agreeing, can now safely quit quarreling with figments of 
his own overactive imagination ;)

Right. A bad model. Resembling recursive homunkuli to explain cognition. 
Infinite regress, while each stage having the same complexity. Baad model.

Only these currently outside the light cone beginning with spacetime

Of course they are not. Theoretically, you can influence everying within 
your light cone. If the system is extremely ergodic, it even _will_
be influenced, whether you wish it, or not.

This one went right beyond me. Huh?

_Can_ philosophy be useful at all? ;)

Mental calisthenics is fun. At the very least it keeps you from going 
human turnip too soon. Medicine men say that, at least.

Yes. Moreover, it can keep us from thinking other, more constructive 
thoughts, and doing others, more constructive tasks. We always quietly 
assume that thinking enhances our fitness. In some (most?) cases it does 
not. A bummer, eh?

Thinking can reduce reaction time in a dangerous situation. People with 
good reflexes are certainly better equipped than powerful ponderers. Just 
think about fertility vs. IQ distribution. Does anybody have actual 
statistics at hand?

Sigh... I have a strong impression that you might be right. For what 
its worth, I believe (just a sentiment, of course) in existance of 
external, let's call it objective, reality.

I wasn't implying strict determinism! It's just that there is a trend 
for complexity, and for increasingly benign cooperation strategies, 
them cropping up sooner or later. To predict its exact occurence is 
awfully hard if not impossible, of course.

It certainly is.

No. A complex system can "understand" a drastically simpler one. It can 
contain a primitive model of itself (in fact it probably must to 
survive, it has to represent its surroundings, and itself within its 
surrounds for future planning. Some bipedal primates go to great length 
even to build metamodels, etc.). We all do.

> few people who think that human beings are a kind of computer. I suspect

No, not a computer. I just think information is a basic property of all 
material systems (compare definitions of statistical entropy/information 
theory entropy), even extremely weird objects like singularities obey 
them, just as is energy. Consider observer interference in a QM 
measurement process. Information has about the same status as energy, imo.

I think there is some equivalency between systems. Consider trajectories of 
a system's statespace evolution. If I can track it with a model with 
sufficient accuracy, the model and the system is equivalent. If it 
wasn't, all modelling would be just an exercise in futility.

Whether the system is a gas box, or a human mind is the same.
 
Consider statespace velocity times trajectory (info-theory) entropy for 
an abstract computation index. I can't think of a system I can't 
benchmark it off hand.

I can't know human mind is just computation, of course. I just suspect. I 
might be wrong, of course.

Not if utilitarism tries to derive implementable future strategies from 
guessing the shape of the Great & Mysterious Fitness Function. If there is 
such a thing, that is.

I think the iterated prisonner's dilemma (iPD) might well give us handy 
rules for dealing with our co-humans. I mean: what can we lose? Just 
building a wrong strategy from a wrong model. So what? It rarely kills 
one, at least not immediately. Why should I resist the evolutionary 
process, once I am aware it exists? I may. I may not. Free will? Who 
cares.

Alas, I am a cave man. I have no idea what these distinguished gentlemen 
thought and wrote. My (very fuzzy) understanding of utilitarism is based 
on some "The Mind's I" contribution, about God being utilitarist, and such.

Hey, that's a perfectly rational thing to do! Ad hominem works great in a 
debate. That's why it has been invented. We're still not ripe for a 
rational (whatever that might be...) discourse yet, it seems. For now, 
studying rhetoric, and having a Ph.D. in social engineering (wonderful 
term, whoever invented it ;) helps a lot in the real world.

I think that would be a great breakthrough; we would suddenly be able to 
handle many more aspects of the same thing at once. Hmm, this sounds 
almost like a limitation of/on intelligence: a simpleminded being can 
only keep one thing in its head at the time, while more advanced beings 
become exponentially more able as the number increases. A mind able to 
handle 10 things at once might be a genius by our standards, and 100 
things at once is clearly posthuman. 

So, how do we get there? And is the limit due to the rest of our brains 
(which cannot handle the load of more than 7+-2 things at once) or bad 
design (there has so far not been any need for more than 7 things at 
once). If the latter, then increased intelligence may be within reach. 

(Of course, this is just one aspect of intelligence. We might get 
paralyzed by all the possibilities too if we are not careful).

Regarding the cover-up conspiracies of a Navy missile shooting down
TWA 800.  Is this relevant for the issue of government cover-ups?  Or is
there something extropian I'm missing.  Being a Washingtonian, and
knowing plenty of people in gov, I can tell you, they're just people.  And
the military is just people too, with a somewhat lower mean IQ than the
other gov departments.  The idea that people who work for the
government *suddenly* have the ability and resources to cover-up the
biggest secrets and fiascos is a fallacy of disempathy.  Do you think the
gov is smarter than people at the New York Times or CNN?  Do you think
all those involved in the investigation have the exact same ethical matrix?
 And another thing that is inherent--no one can keep a secret long. 
Because a big secret is major leverage in a town based on influence.  It
gets used for leverage over and over again, until it becomes tattered and
exposed.  And the current people are well aware that a cover-up is
more disastrous to political collateral than exposing the truth.  The big
guys can always find a scapegoat to take the rap for a mess-up, but a
real cover-up always leads to the top, they don't want that.  Do you
really think Clinton would take the risk of being involved in the biggest
cover-up of the decade during an election year, when the truth exposed
would just result in the sacking of some navy brass?  Get logical here,
please.  Remember, the X-files is just television, filmed in Vancouver B.C.

1)  You know you are living under tyranny when the failure of the
legislature to churn out new laws on a daily basis is called "grid-lock."

2)  The easier a law is to pass, the harder it is to rescind.

3)  Any law that claims to protect rights that already exist will actually
diminish those rights.

4)  All laws passed "for a good cause" are actually for bad causes.

5)  Laws enacted to help any one group always harm everyone else.

6)  All good things the government says happened thanks to regulation of
commerce happened for other reasons or never really happened at all.

7)  Anything the government "plans" for has already happened.

8)  When there is a budget shortfall to cover non-essential government
services, those services will simply be reclassified as "essential" and
taxes promptly raised.

9)  Citizens who oppose new legislation are always portrayed as villains.

10) Governments do not grant freedoms; they only take them away.

The *universe* consists of all things that have existed across
space-time, some of which once existed but no longer do.  What is the

In general, I agree with this, yet it appears the gov't has the ability to
keep embarrassing things secret for some time. Combined with {in}|{unin}-
tentional lack of media coverage, things can be kept out of the public eye for
many years. Consider the recent coverage of forgotten Korean War prisoners.

Perhaps the truth wil be revealed only after new antiterrorism laws are
passed in the wake of TWA 800.

I don't think the US govt intentionally sets out to kill large numbers of
the citizenry (maybe with certain exceptions). Using whatever events come
along to further their own ends, maybe they're good at that.

This sounds like an excellent psychological study to do. Gather old and 
young people, and divide them into dynamic and passive people (should be 
easy to test using standard psychological tests), and then compare the 
amounts of various hormones in their blood. Perhaps we might see some 
interesting correlations.

Humans do have very good endurance, but that's not because of bipedalism, 
it's because we are better at getting rid of unwanted heat than any other 
land animal of our size, and that's because we have sweat glands on every 
part of our skin, and that's because we don't need a permanent coat of hair, 
and that's because we're smart enough to make an artificial coat and put it

IAN: No contradiction:

Its internal area (a) is red. Its external area (b) is not-red.

Both areas (a) and (b) are inside the area that contains all 
those features necessary for its identity. Surely you agree.

We might call this universal area, the "Super-red-box."
Its "super identity" is its individual identity. As such,
all things in its (b) area alter its individual identity
as it alters the identity of all things in its (b) area.

Its identity -- which is its actual inside area -- is not 
confined to a finite region of space as physical fact -- 
as ID alteration by external alteration -- clearly proves 
and which I believe we generally agree.


So I am saying that, as facts dictate, its identity is
derived from the superset, its identity -- its inside 
area -- is not other than the Superset. This does not 
negate that there is this thing we observe called 
"subset," but is in fact the necessary structure of 
its individual existence. Therein lies the paradox: 
the individual is derived from the whole, and thus 
is a part of the whole as the whole is a part of 
the individual. That's a logical identity/unity.

That's holistic identity, and it does not deny 
individuality. The whole defines the individual
as the individual defines the whole. A logical 
symmetry. In total, the whole with parts 
defines the whole.

This is not something that supports collectivism,
as it always is, it need not be enforced, in fact,
it shows that central planners would be redundant.
The "invisible hand" is the true "central planner."
The desire of each individual defines the price
of a given commodity, as the price defines the 
individuals desire for that commodity.

Holistic identity -- whole defines part, part defines 
whole -- is the logical structure of everything.

I hear Andrew Grove speak a lot lately: just yesterday
I was at his lecture at MIT, and now it's NPR.
He published a book, "only the paranoid survive" - mostly
on handling organizational changes; there, he speaks
of Strategic Inflection Points, etc.  It may not be
a breakthrough in the management theory or philosophy
of technology, but is definitely worth attention - at
least as a chance to look into the internals of information
processing architecture of one of the most influential brains
in computer industry.

One thing that upset/surprised me today listening to Grove's
talk on NPR, is his answer to the question on perspectives of
nanotechnology, and whether he thinks it may be used for
manufacturing computer chips.

He answered:

"To tell the truth, I even do not know why we are not using
this technique".

I would think a man in his position would have a better
knowledge of perspective technologies.
On the other hand, he may have played dumb so that nobody would
suspect Intel is putting most of its research money into Nano-86
or something like that.  With strategic plans being such an
important part of company's welfare, one would expect that CEOs
would be very good at concealing their true opinions in the most
sensitive areas, and making up something plausible with a straight
face.  They would make excellent poker players, these industry
leaders.

I used to be in similar situations; I had some KGB folks ask me
things about pacifist activities (considered criminal at the time);
the best reply I could find was not to deny them, but to make believe
I was so far away from it so I didn't quite understand the question.
It definitely helped my strategic well-being. ;-)  I had a better
excuse than Grove to hide the truth then - I had more to lose.

  So what do you think: is he so far away from nanotech that he
hasn't heard about it, or so close that he plays dumb?

Maybe his subordinates have looked into it, and told him that it just
wasn't a good bet yet, but couldn't articulate their reasons to his
satisfaction.   So he went with their advice, but is still dissatisfied.

Good point.  I should have phrased my question differently.  I would 
define things that 'used to be' and 'could be, but aren't yet' as 
'facts' - they're just facts we may not be aware of at the moment.  
Don't you agree?

'Limited spectrums' still employ photons, which exist.  'Noise' may 
obscure what we're trying to perceive, but that noise *exists* - it's 
not metaphysical or supernatural interference.  What we *see* exists.  
The fact that what we see may require interpretation does not mean that 
we see non-existent things.  On the other hand, if I *imagine* a purple 
walrus, not a single photon is tracing a path from the sun to the walrus 
and into my eyes to be interpreted and registered in my brain.  Instead, 
I'm taking my memories of walruses and applying my memory of the color 
purple to it, to construct a hypothetical model.  I'm not 'seeing' a 
purple walrus in any sense that makes the purple walrus as much a 'fact' 
as things I perceive via the physical process of sight.

These are good reasons to place *more* emphasis on drawing distinctions 
between fact and imagination, not less.  Of course we have to make an 
effort to interpret perception properly.  Giving up and equating all 
perception with pure imagination is not helpful.  Not everything that is 
uncertain is *equally* uncertain.

Anders:  or does anybody know
When one imagines a visual stimuli, does it also register (measurably) as a
change in the visual part of the brain? I know that they can measure light
hitting the retina registering in the back of the brain.... Can one "see" the
process of this kind of imaging ( as is "seeing" a purple walrus" ) in the
brain _ or  trace it to retinal movement ( like in REM)  or, more importantly
induce or improve the abilities to "see" in one's imagination?

For example if one applies stimuli to the visual parts of the brain would it
help someone "see" the purple walrus who had otherwise no ability to imaging
visually?

Have there been any studies about this "internal sight' that may be helpful
to neural/retinal  VR?  I would think this virtual/ visual part of science -
especially in the application of creating implants would be very important to
someone who want s to be augmented.   Or even more to the "Uploaded"....

Speaking from personal experience: been there, done that. :\ :)
Last time I did a Myers-Briggs (years ago), I evaluated as EN<T+F>P,
what some would call a "visionary journalist"--talk about paralysis! <big g>

Properly directed attention is a wondrous thing. The lack of an 
operating manual for the brain has been remarked on by many. 
Some people think that "mania", "depression", "dysthymia", 
"obsessive-compulsive disorder" and "autism" are in many cases just 
different-appearing quasi-stable states that all boil down to an 
inability to shift attention. And stuckness sure can look like 
stupidity. Of course, so can irrelevance (mania, schizophrenia)
that may not look like "stuckness" to some people.

My current view is that "chunking up" (which may be the same as 
subsumption, I'm not sure), delegating (using trust and Iterated 
Prisoner's Dilemma) properly, and "optimal" (low-overshoot) context 
switching are all ways to get a lot more out of the brain I've got 
right now.

In my case, five years of introspection following a failed 
relationship, plus the Avatar course, plus some work with my 
neurochemistry seems to have put me in my personal bliss zone more of 
the time than I would have thought possible or comprehensible say ten 
years ago. Have you seen the "Hedonistic Imperative" Web page?

I think the notion that seven plus or minus two was just good enough 
to get the genes through is probably a workable "least hypothesis".

You mean prospects for nanotechnology, not perspectives; also 
prospective technologies, not perspective.   

I think you are reading too much into what he said.   He didn't say 
he had never heard of nanotechnology.  He just said he didn't know 
why it isn't already being used to make chips.  

If I were a competitor of his, I would take this to mean that 
1. he has known about the idea of nanotechnology for a long time, 
2. he thinks it is basically a valid idea, 
3. he has some of his people working on it, 
4. they have run into obstacles 
    a.  corporate inertia
    b.  a steep learning curve, 
5. he expects to be using this technique to make chips, eventually, 
6. he is surprised that it is taking so long.  

Incidentally, my anti-nanotech comments only apply to fantasies about 
replacing the entire economy with do-it-yourself genie machines.  
I don't doubt for a minute that it will eventually be possible to "grow" 
computer chips, smart materials, fuel cells, and batteries.  This will be 
an important part (yes *part* ) of the economy in a few decades.

Ibogaine is a drug / botanical that Extropians should know about 
as it is a powerful agent for positive personal change. Recently shown
in a very positive light on the Discovery Channel program "Innovations,"
it has the remarkable ability to halt drug addictions, in many cases,
in only one single use. This has been demonstrated in research the 
world over. Yet this drug addiction curing drug has been generally
repressed by The Establishment -- i.e., the powers that be. But 
even generally, Ibogaine seems to end any form of habituated 
behavior -- hell, maybe it could even get me to stop 
going on about A + not-A. ;^) ...then again. %^)

Below, Aron Kay, famous pie-throwing Yippie, guides us to Internet
resources for more info on Ibogaine.  Below that, I talk about 
the experience of a friend who took Ibogaine and then I go 
into the threat this drug posses to The Establishment, and more...

   IAN: This is also one reason why Ibogaine is suppressed: it 
   causes a "trip." As I understand form having interviewed a 
   friend who took it, it causes one to  "step outside"  one's 
   life and see the whole; see what steps one could have taken; 
   see how the steps one did take lead to the various conditions 
   one now faces; how future steps can lead to future outcomes and 
   how one can have control of one's own destiny.  These insights 
   are reported as major personal breakthroughs leading to positive 
   change, growth and hope for the future. Along with freedom from 
   past habituated patterns, Ibogaine opens the door to a "new you."

   Ibogaine seems to be -- as many psychedelic drugs are reported 
   to be -- a "teacher drug." And its potential for abuse is very 
   low, since, as I understand, its effects become nil with constant 
   exposure, and also, like other psychedelic agents, it can be very 
   exhausting. It's important to note that the powerful psychedelic 
   drug LSD was also shown to brake drug addiction. [1]

   The Establishment cannot allow the knowledge that states 
   of mind outside the control of the State might be beneficial 
   to the individual. Ibogaine, with its proven ability to lead 
   to positive change, is a key drug in this respect. It stands 
   as an  example that the  psychedelic  experience  is itself 
   associated with healing, and they can't let that information 
   get out. The State alone must control the mind of the people. 
   Drug control is by definition mind control. Self-control of 
   drugs is a direct threat to the mind control of the masses.

   Ibogaine can be a key not only to freedom from addiction 
   to drugs, but freedom from addiction to drug laws.


______________________________________________________________
REFERENCE  &  IMPORTANT FACTS ________________________________

[1] "Nearly a thousand hard-core alcoholics received high-dose
LSD treatment at Weyburn Hospital, and the rate of recovery was
significantly higher than for other forms of therapy -- an 
astounding 50%."  ACID DREAMS: The CIA, LSD and the Sixties
Rebellion, Grove Weidenfeld, NY, 1985, p.49-50.

"Originally tested on alcoholic in Canada with remarkable results,
high-dose [ LSD ] therapy was subsequently applied to a wide range
diagnostic categories: juvenile delinquency, narcotics addiction, 
severe character neurosis,... " Ibid., p. 57.  On p. 57-8 we find:

      "The CIA was not interested in the therapeutic 
      application of LSD. The men of  ARTICHOKE  and
      MK-ULTRA  [ CIA operations ]  defined the drug 
      as an anxiety-producing agent, and they realized 
      it would be relatively easy to "brake" a person 
      exposed to highly stressful stimuli while high 
      on acid. .... CIA and military interrogators 
      proceeded to utilize the drug as an instrument 
      of psychological torture."  

Did you know that prior to assassination, Senator Robert Kennedy 
stated in opposition to govt halting of LSD therapeutic research: 

      "I think that we have given too much emphasis and 
      so much attention to the fact that it [ LSD ] can 
      be dangerous and that it can hurt an individual 
      who uses it... that perhaps to some extent we have 
      lost sight of the fact that it can be very, very 
      helpful in our society if used properly."  p. 93. 

Obviously this man had to go, for, indeed it would be helpful but 
this must be so only for The Establishment. This requires keeping 
it out of the hands of the people. Only those who wish to use it 
for torture and mind control should control this powerful agent.

I highly recommend the book ACID DREAMS, by Martin Lee and Bruce
Shlain, quoted above. It's a shocking and comprehensive review of 
the significant impact of this drug on both society and secret govt-
CIA operations. It covers virtually all that is known about the CIA's 
extensive research into LSD as a tool for torture and mind control.
This book has mega-doses of information every American should know,
such as a super-hallucinogen the govt has at the ready in case  
the people attempted to overthrow the govt by force.

Ian,

Remember that your philosophy of holistic unity is in your own head, and is 
not necessarily true about the world outside your head; the world which is 
providing information to your senses is forever beyond your direct reach (you 
don't see the world; you see the *effect* the world has on you).  Your 
philosophy may make a great deal of logical sense to you, but that doesn't 
mean that the real world categorizes things the way you do.  Your entire 
notion of identity is entirely fictional.  Yes, it appeals to you, but that is 
no reason to suppose that reality actually organizes itself that way.  Your 
philosophical world is an invented one, a sort of virtual world, and just 
because something makes sense in that world, such as the idea that every part 
is identical to the whole universe, doesn't mean that it is an actual feature 
of the real world.  Yes, granted certain premises and assumptions about how to 
percieve things and categorize them, your idea is perfectly correct, but I 
don't think that the world actually organizes itself according to your 
personal philosophy, nor do I think that your personal philosophy of holistic 
unity is likely to be a feature of the real world.  And even if it was, I 
don't see what value this way of looking at thing actually has.  Does it help 
us understand the way our world works at all?  Can it help us understand 
chemical reactions?  Can it help us build better technologies?  Or is it 
simply a mental game with no external relevance?

I'll shout for Sarah's corner (at least I think I am.  Please correct me, 
Sarah, if you disagree).

This reminds me of the logical "paradox" that a certain bunch of people get 
off on.  They have several ways of stating it.  Here's one:

(a) Sentence 'b' is true.
(b) Sentence 'a' is false.

Is sentence 'a' true or false?

Now, they enjoy watching people squirm, trying to figure it out, because if 
it's true, then it's validating sentence 'b' which says it's false, and if 
it's false, then sentence 'b' is true and that's exactly what sentence 'a' is 
saying, so it can't be false.  But it can't be true either.

This is analagous to presenting someone with a red box and asking, "Is this 
box black or white?"  Of course, it's neither black nor white, it's red, which 
is something else altogether.  

And, likewise, sentence 'a' is neither true nor false; it is 
self-contradictory (via sentence 'b'), and that is something else altogether.  
The mistake was in assuming that "true" or "false" are the only options for 
sentences to be.  Not every sentence is true or false; there are many other 
categories of sentences.  But narrow-minded logic only has two categories; 
true and false, and it is not adequate to deal with reality, which suggests 
many, many categories.

A deterministic computer can also have memory (it can retain information which

on whatever type of algorithims it has been programmed with or has evolved.  
Having these abilities doesn't somehow, magically transform the deterministic 
computer into a non-deterministic computer.  And us having these abilities 
doesn't magically transform us into non-Markov chains.  Markov chains can 
exibhit memory and planning.  These are simply types of algorithms; they are 
not magical processes.  They are poorly understood processes, but that is no 
reason to invoke miracles to explain them.  I see no reason to invoke any sort 
of "life force" or "soul" to explain ourselves; these are simply ways of 
avoiding further analysis.  If there is a "life force", what are its 
properties?  I say, the properties of self-copying, self-maintaining chemical 
reactions.  What are the qualities of our "souls"?  Only the qualities arising 
from the activities in the brain.  This false dichotomy, between the mind and 
matter is one of the things that really bothers me.  This stubborn desire for 
the magical.  

We, our minds and everything about us are part of the natural world, the 
physical world.  There is no need to propose any sort of super-natural realm 
to explain anything.  And, in fact, proposing the super-natural is simply a 
way of *avoiding* explanation.  It may in fact be that the universe is not a 
Markov chain, and it may also be that we are not Markov chains, but I think 
that our ability to remember and to plan are silly reasons to suppose that we 
are not Markov chains, since Markov chains can have the same abilities.  
Humans seem to have the irrational urge to think that somehow they escape the 
laws of nature which everything else follows.  So they propose the fantasies 
of God and soul and then complacently think that they are saved by some 
magical being instead of saving themselves through their own efforts, through 
technology.

OK so:

We might do, but remember you require a 'not-super-red-box' otherwise the
'super-red-box' cannot exist. Since you posit that the not-red-box is
everything but the red box, then the 'super-red-box' must be everything,
since it is red-box and not-red-box. So what, then, is the
'not-super-red-box'? Your logical definition is iterative but is bounded on
its first iteration. Huh?

The Economics of Digital Information and Intellectual Property

Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA

January 23-25, 1997

 First Announcement and Call for Papers

Harvard University is hosting this symposium to broaden and deepen
understanding of emerging economic and business models for
global publishing and information access and the attendant
transformation of international information markets, institutions, and
businesses. The goal is to provide managers in public, private, and
nonprofit sectors with a practical framework for developing
program strategies and assessing the efficiency and competitiveness of
new information markets and institutions. It will address
questions such as:

--What will be the principal pricing models for information in an
advanced global Internet?

-- How will pricing models be affected by different technological
factors and market environments?

-- What will be the relationships between classic production costs,
transaction costs, and the economic value of intellectual
property?

-- How will different pricing practices at lower layers affect the
pricing of information?

-- What are likely long-term trends and scenarios for different pricing
models? What will be the effect of bundling or unbundling of
information services?

-- How will changing cost structures change the allocation of rights
between authors and publishers and other intermediaries?

-- How will markets for complementary products and services affect the
pricing and use of information?

-- What are the policy implications of different pricing models?

-- How do these reflect policy values associated with different kinds of
information?

Background:

The rapid growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web is trans-
forming the way information is accessed and used in business,
education, and the home. New models for distributing, sharing, linking,
and enhancing information are appearing, often embodied in
software or infrastructure. No change is more dramatic than the shift to
user-initiated retrieval for text-based information
formerly distributed in the form of physical objects by
publisher-initiated manufacturing and delivery. A similar shift may be
underway for sound and video. However, the considerable differences in
bandwidth and storage requirements between text,
images, sound, and video may dictate different cost and pricing models
in the near and mid-term. As production and distribution
costs decline, transaction costs and the value of intellectual property
may assume greater prominence. On the other hand,
standards and software may work to substantially reduce transaction
costs over the long run. With barriers to entry reduced by
technology, information markets may become extremely competitive,
reducing margins and possibly lowering the economic value
of many forms of intellectual property.

The Internet and the World Wide Web are characterized by explosion of
information along with an explosion of new tools for
navigating information. Competition for attention intensifies as
companies extend their marketing, sales, and support functions into
the Internet. Useful or entertaining information may have greater value
in attracting customer attention in an increasingly
competitive marketplace for information. Accordingly, it has been argued
that information will be valued less as intellectual
property and more in terms of the access it provides to other markets
and the value it adds to relationships. As a practical
matter, copyright may be overshadowed by the growing use of contracts as
a means of both securing value and defining
expectations in continuing relationships. Positions in simple
distribution chains are likely to erode as a result of disintermediation
and intense competition. In particular, reduced production costs and the
desire to avoid residual transaction costs may force
vendors away from complex pricing models. For example, usage-based
pricing may give way to subscription pricing. Such
dynamics may lead to new institutional arrangements for managing
life-cycle costs of information, especially in small markets
where users are also producers.

Similarly, as production costs decrease, the costs of information may be
assimilated by the underlying infrastructure or assumed
by users. This trend may be seen in the pricing of online services and
in the massive volunteering of content on the World Wide
Web. The Web, including software and servers, enables editorial and
navigation functions traditionally performed by publishers and
libraries to be performed in increased measure by individual authors and
end users. Cost analysis in this environment may hinge on
identification and evaluation of critical bottlenecks -- with the
understanding that many technological limitations may be
short-lived. Congestion may lead to new methods of supplementing
point-to-point transmissions, such as caching, mirroring, and
satellite broadcast. These new mechanisms may raise intellectual
property and interconnection questions that may be addressed
both as business and policy issues. Congestion may also hasten the
implementation of type of service priority at either the network
or server levels. Negotiation over quality and scope of service may
become extremely complex, and vendors may be tempted to
price to as many dimensions of value as possible. However, simple
pricing models may have surprisingly strong appeal, as they
have had in the analog environment. Sequential distribution windows for
motion pictures illustrate the potential for simple price
differentiation in a technologically complex environment. Price
differentiation is now playing an increasingly important role in the
marketing of software and databases. In fact, there may be public policy
arguments for price differentiation, not only for reasons
of efficiency but to enable some of level of access for those who cannot
afford access under standard terms, just as public
libraries have offered access for those who could not afford to buy.


*****

The Information Infrastructure Project emphasizes communication and
sharing of insight among scholars and practitioners with

Good grief!  Do you think TWA800 would be a big cover-up?  Apparently, you
only have access to Establish news outlets!

Ever hear of the Whitewater Cover-up, the WACO cover-up, the Ruby Ridge
cover-up, the Ron Brown crash cover-up, the OKC Bomb cover-up,
Iran-Contra, CIA Drug Running at the Mena airport, etc. etc.?  How about
the failed war on drugs?  FDA oppression and cover-up of the value of
nutrients in life extention, etc?  Or the failed war on poverty.

Is everyone but Ian Goddard asleep on this list?  Or reading nothing but
science books?

If Extropians are for self-ownership I find it hard to fathom if only a
few are aware that "self-ownership" far from complete in this increasingly
Statist society.

Below I demonstrate the utility of holistic identity in explaining
and thus revealing the structure of the physical phenomena, including
quantum phenomena of non/trans-locality.

IAN: What your saying is the direct opposite of the reality. Aristotelian 
logic is how the mind categorizes the physical world -- into cleanly 
divided sets. In reality things are derived from relations that 
transcend our conceptually imposed boundaries. In reality things 
are all connected in a unifed continuum. Holistic identity relects
this unified continuum.

Ever heard of * relativity * ?  You may think that relational motion 
-- which is a relational identity -- is all in my head, but there is 
something out there called motion, and it, just like all identities, 
is derived from relation. What I introduce is a relativity of identity: 
A is derived and exists only in relation to ~A. Here's two physical 
points in space deomstrating relational identity / motion:

A is in motion    A * ---->  =  45 mph

relative to       B *        =   0 mph

The velocity / identity of A is derived from the relative identity of B.
The identity of A is therefore a holistic derivative of the whole filed, 
and the identity of A contains the identity B, and vice versa -- their
identity is unified -- for the following is also simultaneously true: 

B is in motion    A       *  =    0 mph

relative to       B  <--- *  =  -45 mph

Free from relation to B, A has no velocity, and vice versa. Therefore
the velocity-identity of A is null apart from relation and is therefore
exclusively holistic. Quite clearly this is a property of the physical
universe, not "my head" as you'd have as believe. And it's the constant
logical structure of ALL identity, of ALL features of physical existence.

                A = ( A + ~A )   or   A = 0

Relation is real, it's no fantasy. It's the idea of nonrelational identity,
to which you seem to adhere, that IS a fantasy because you cannot show a 
single example in the physical universe of it existing.

If we stick to physical verification as the basis of belief, we are 
most sure to come to the truth. I can verify physically the relational
nature of identity till the end of time. On the other hand, my opponents, 
most people, cannot even find a single example of a nonrelational thing. 
Does that stop them from believing in them? Not at all, because it's 
not how the brain categorizes information.

If the physical universe is nonrelational, please show me an atomic
particle with no external area. Please show me a state of motion
with no symmetrical motion. Please show me a location that is a 
location free from external reference. Please show me left free
from right, up free from down, fast free from slow, big free from 
small, bright free from dark,.... you can't do it. Clearly, the 
idea of nonrelational identity is the epitome of the absurd.

IAN: So, according to you, even if it is true, we must ignore it.
Geez. I'd say that attitude is an anathema to the highest goal of 
human inquiry -- the know the truth.

 > Does it help us understand the way our world works at all?  

IAN: If everything is relative. Yes. Everything is relative, 
therefore it helps us understand the structure of our world.

 > Can it help us understand chemical reactions?  Can it help us build

IAN: I believe that it explains quantum phenomena such as quantum
tunneling, instantaneous action at a distance, nonlocality of sub-
atomic particles not under observation, multiple locations of a
single subatomic particle. All these effects are, I believe, a 
logical expression of the fact that the identity/nature of a 
thing is actually non-local, is not other than the field itself.

If the identity of a physical entity is nonlocal, as holistic 
identity dictiates, then these quantum phenomena are predictable.

I cannot say what technologies if any might arise from knowledge
of holistic identity, and I don't really care. My effort is to 
describe the nature of the objective universe, which is not 
always what mind imposes on it. The mind assumes identity
is absolute but in fact it is relative. If holistic identity
is the truth, then it should yield applications if not simply
describe how and why things are the way the are.

Back to basics, folks. Every country which has a good standard of
living, where survival in one's old age is not dependent on the 
number of one's offspring, has had a slowing of population growth.
In the USA, we would see a population decrease if there were no
immigration. If the Extropian vision is a positive one, the goal will
be increased quality of life for one's children, which will always
be costly, and increasingly so.

  This is a well-known correlation, but not necessarily a causal
connection; demographers tend to use statistics as the basis for
reasoning, instead of the other way round.

  In a rural setting, children are not much of a handicap to one's
personal and economic progress; in the urban environment, they are,
as parents have to work far from home, children in the city need more
supervision and protection; education in the city is different from
just helping parents in their work - which turns a child's education
process from an increasing assistance to parents to an increasing
burden, free natural playgrounds are replaced by little constructed
ones that come at a cost, etc., etc.

  Such factors determine people's decisions regarding the optimal
number of children - but they are all reflections of the structure
of the economic life of a family, rather than appear as direct
consequences of its productivity.

  If you return parents into their homes - and closer to nature -
with telecommuting, allow children to attend virtual schools or just
download knowledge into their heads, use intelligent machine to
increase safety, and make a few more structural adjustments, then
the most advanced - including economically - households may find it
much easier to have more children, and the correlation between
family prosperity and size may change.

Any system, nano or macro, capable of creating microprocessors, 
will contain within it many human level-intelligences.  

The "automated" factories that you speak of are only automated 
at one point in the manufacturing process.  The automated machinery 
is designed by engineers who understand its purpose, and who 
understand how their own jobs fit into the larger scheme of things.  
The microprocessors themselves are designed by engineers who know 
what microprocessors are for, and who can talk, in human language, 
to the engineers who are designing the machines to be used in the 
automated factory.  

The factories are part of a system which contains many human-level 
intelligences:  the managers, the accountants, the lawyers, the 
programmers who write the software that the other people use, the 
teachers who train the employees, the marketing people who sell the 
computers, the stockbrokers who sell stock in the company, and so 
forth.  All those people are part of the system.  They are all there 
for a reason.  The automated machinery could not exist without them.  

If you substitute "agribusiness" for "manufacturing" in this discussion, 
the same principle still applies.  Instead of engineers you will have 
botanists, agronomists, biotechnicians, etc.  

John continues:  

> Human judgment is not involved whenever one logic gate needs to be 
> connected to another, very dumb automatic process do it for us, 

I'm not saying human judgment is required at *every* point in the 
manufacturing system.  I'm saying that human judgment is required at 
*many* points.  

> If we needed millions of pipelines we would find a way 
> to mass produce them too, 

Yes, and the same principle would apply to the mass production of 
pipelines, or anything else.  There are many points where a decision 
has to be made by somebody who has an understanding of the project 
as a whole, and who understands the purpose of his activity.  Such 
decisions require human judgment.  

Have you ever worked on a construction site?  or in a factory, or a 
refinery, or any industrial enterprise?  I get the feeling that I'm talking 
to people who have spent most of their lives writing computer code, 
and have no sense of how the physical world works.  --But then, 
even a software project has to have somebody who understands 
what the software is for, and how it fits into the whole scheme of things.  
Microsoft employs quite a few entities with human-level intelligence, 
and always will.  

> We know for sure that it's possible to manufacture 
> extremely complex objects, like human beings

No.  To "manufacture" something means to make it to a specification.  
Human beings are not manufactured to spec.  If they were, as in 
"Brave New World," a large staff of technicians and other employees 
would be required, just as in any other manufacturing system.

Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

A quick search through my saved Extropian list collection doesn't find a
mention of "Ghost in the Shell."

"Ghost in the Shell" is a Japanese animated movie which has been making a
run in American theaters recently.  If it comes to your town, SEE IT.

It is very well made,
it is real science fiction, although in an action movie format
   (well, action with lots of intense dialog including some
    philosophical and evolutionary pondering)
it is a movie for people who can think,
it is a Very Extropian Movie,
it includes a really funny/apt visual pun/metaphor featuring the Tree of Life,
it's kool.

A "ghost" in this movie is, loosely, a person's consciousness or personality.
The something-or-other that makes someone a person, whether it's still in
their biological brain or is in a computer at the moment.  The
available technologies aren't all explained, more taken for granted, but
we know that some people have computers as well as brains in their heads.
A clarifying example is someone whose memories have been maliciously
hacked so badly that the person "no longer has a ghost."

A "shell" is a body.

If you're in the Boston area I've got a copy of the video.  But I
definitely recommend seeing it in a movie theater.  On video you spend
more time going "what's that?...oh," and miss things at the fast pace.
The bandwidth was a definite plus for this movie.  It was nice to have
a movie showing me things for once instead of me wanting to give
the director a piece of *my* mind...er, so to speak.

Sir,
Have been browsing the net, and trying to grasp how our "law
enforcement" officers so routinely violate our rights, i.e., 'speeding
tickets,' where no one is hurt, no one complains, and the only one
charging you is the officer.
I just received a speeding ticket about 6 weeks ago - my first ticket,
ever, in over 15 years, and I'm not sure I'm going to pay it.

Sasha.

************************************************************************
Greetings!  I'm inviting you to participate on the all-star, rapid-strike
ad hoc reviwing committee for my upcoming paper "Punishing the Persona:
Correctional Strategies for the Virtual Offender" to be published as a
chapter in _The Undernet_:  Internet and the Other (Steven Jones, ed.) Sage
Press.

This paper constitutes the third part of my research trilogy investigating
governance, crime, and punishment in virtual systems.  The other parts are:

"Searching for the Leviathan in Usenet" in _Cybersociety:  Computer-Mediated
Communication and Community_ (1995), Steven Jones (ed.), Sage Press.

"The Social Construction of Rape in Virtual Reality" in _Network and
Netplay:  Groups on the Internet_ (forthing in 1996), Fay Sudweeks, Margaret
McLaughlin, and Sheizaf Rafaeli (eds.), MIT Press and the Association for
the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI).

If you are interested in commenting on the current draft of "Punishing the
Persona," your "rapid-strike" response is urged, otherwise I may not be able
to address your comments until another project (PtP, version 2.0??).

The secret URL for the paper is: 

http://www.portal.com/~rich/texts/punish.html

You may circulate the paper to others who may wish to comment, but the
purpose of the "secret URL" is to discourage mass distribution.  This is
just a draft.  I don't want people archiving an unfinished product.

Next is a little blurb about followed by the paper's abstract.  I hope to
hear from you soon.


Thanks in advance,

                                     BIOGRAPHY

                  Richard MacKinnon (http://www.portal.com/~rich/) is a
            political scientist in the Government Department and the
            Advanced Communication Technologies Laboratory (ACTLAB) at
            the University of Texas at Austin.  As a former police
            officer, he is able to draw on his law enforcement
            background to inform his theories for addressing computer-
            mediated crime and virtual offenders.  His research
            interests are in the political anthropology, cultural
            studies, and governance of virtual environments.  Currently,
            he is co-developing _honoria in ciberspazio_, a cyberopera
            about net.relationships and fleshmeets.  He spends most of
            his online time dwelling in a community called Cybermind and
            after spending several years in Silicon Valley, he now lives
            in Austin.
               ------------------------------------------------------

                                      ABSTRACT

                  The development of cybersociety poses significant
            theoretical and socio-political challenges attributable to a
            social space populated by "bodyless" beings.  This chapter
            explores the phenomenon of bodylessness and its
            ramifications for the criminal corrections process.  In the
            case of a well-known virtual rape, the perpetrator's account
            was deleted following a meeting of the virtual community's
            members.  This virtual execution of his online persona is
            rigorously analyzed to determine if punishment of virtual
            bodies is a suitable means for meting out virtual
            jurisprudence.  Guided largely by Foucault's insight into
            non-corporal or bodyless punishment, a standard of "just
            adjudication" is developed to insure that the punishment
            fits the crime.  In part, this standard directs punishment
            for virtual offenses primarily towards the virtual body.
            Accordingly, offline offenses ought to be directed primarily
            towards the user.  To this end, a classification scheme is
            proposed to differentiate virtual offenses from conventional
            computer crimes.  Three cases are examined in light of this
            classification and standard.  They are the "rape of legba;"
            the University of Michigan student, Jake Baker, who was
            arrested and expelled for his Usenet posting of a "sex
            fantasy;" and Kevin Mitnick, the infamous hacker accused of
            committing several computer-related crimes.  It is hoped
            that the guidelines developed herein for adjudicating
            computer-mediated offenses will insure that the punishment
            delivered is commensurate with the crime. (Approximate
            length: 15,000 words).

        There seems to be a section of people on the transhuman and
extropian mailing lists who enjoy transhuman and extropian art.  In light of
this enjoyment, I wouldn't mind finding out if there would be an interest in
a >H \ Extropian Art mailing list.  The list could include written art forms
(such as poetry :), plays, short-stories, etc.) as well as information
regarding pertinent web-pages; in fact, the ML could have *anything* related
to Extro \ >H
Art.  I personally do not know exactly how to set up an ML, and therefore, I
would muchly appreciate any suggestions, tips and comments on how I can go
about doing this.  Please send messages either on or off list as to whether
there is enough interest for this to become manifest.


                                                Thanks!!


P.S.  Help from anyone 'knowledged' in the field of MLs (is there such a
field? :)) would also be muchly appreciated!

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

For hundreds of years we've been using the gregorian calendar with all it's
psudomystical crap in the months including Friday the 13s. It is finally
time (no pun intented) to scrap this calendar and install a new
scientifically accurate one. I read something about this in scientific
american. There is a new decimal calendar proposed to start on the year 2000
dividing the months into something like 36 weeks consisting of 8 days each
or something like that. I would like to see the article again because I am
unsure of the exact details.

As we proceed closer to the millenium things are going to get stranger and
more bizarre due to religions predicting the end of the world which will
also stir up topics such as UFOs and psychic phenomenon which we are even
beginning to see leech into the extropian and transhuman newsgroups. It will
all pass and rationality will triumph but we must just wait for this time to
pass and attempt to become involved in this whole phylum of memes revolving
around the 2000 mark. 

To name a few:
Telekinesis
Telepathy
Spontaneous Combustion
UFO sightings & abductions
Huge Gov't Conspiracies

What am I forgetting?
Also, it will be interesting to see the first two on the list become a
reality through technological innovations with nanotechnology and
brain-computer interfaces.

I suppose you could control any greenhouse effect with seeding the ocean
with iron for algae bloom and also I've read about them using silver nitrate
injected into the I-wall of hurricanes to dissolve them but Cuba got upset
since this experiment occurred around the cuban missile crisis and Cuba
thought the US was attempting to learn ways of redirecting the hurricanes
toward them. Pretty stupid to stifle research for that.

There is a HAARP website, Art Bell has a link to it. It makes an

Beware (they say at the site): your access is being monitored!
What really gets my goat is the total lack (as far as I could see),
of acknowledgement to Nikolai Tesla, who conceived much of the
idea. He was dismissed as a crackpot, then and now.

Hi folks

...hitting both lists here, hope that's not impolite...  (adrift in the
datasea...) (aargh)

The debate between Lyle and other more optimistic nanoists seems to me to
depend on the question of `tacit knowledge', evolutionarily-acquired tricks
for dealing with the world - life regarded as GAs at the end of a three
billion year planet-sized run.  How are these little buggers supposed to be
programmed to do their job of building a starship in the back-yard pool?
It's no good pointing to mitochondria and ribosomes and crying `existence
proof!', unless you can specify or emulate all the subtle algorithms they
encode.  And even assuming a Very Big Smart AI Thing which isn't yet
autonomous to number-crunch the specs for yr starship, how is this template
vectored out to the trillions of nano fabricators doing the back-stroke in
the milky pool of goop?  Radio?  Infra-red?  Batons (or quipu, as the Incas
would have done) handed physically back and forth? Is there a precise
cascade of fabricators, and chemo-gradients, and all that standard
make-a-meat-body stuff?  (Not in a goop pool, I'd have thought.)

Probably all this is explained in NANOSYSTEMS, but shamefully my university
library doesn't have a copy... nor does my local academic book store, yet.

Best, Damien

I'm not sure it is the 2000 meme that is dangerous, it is the millennial
meme. While there are many fringe groups awaiting armageddon in 1999,
2000, 2001 or possibly 2012, there are many more people who expect
Something Big to happen soon, not necessarily at the millennium. This 
widespread premonition of a great upheaval/transcendence will influence 
their actions, both for good and evil - some will become passive and 
quietly await what happens, other will become extremely agitated and try 
to avert it, fight for it or generally mess up things. And if everybody 
expects something to happen, it will happen - it is just a matter of 
self-fulfilling prophecies. 

I'm not sure rationality will triumph on its own - it has its strengths 
and weaknesses as a meme.

Actually, most of them could be implemented with technology (combustion = 
microwave beams, nanocomputer overload. Government conspiracies could be 
facilitated using AI).

But biology is harder to control well. Drexlerian nanotech might be dry, 
rigid and overly limited in some respects, but it is predictable. Making 
an organism that can do the uploading process would involve not only the 
uploading problem, but how to make it coexist well with the human body.

Yes, but what about the ecological consequences? Algae blooms are 
complicated things, and influence a lot of other systems. I think we have 
to develop a new technology, ecoengineering, to deal with deliberate 
modifications of ecology, climate and other aspects of the environment. 
Maybe we could start algae blooms in the tropical "desert" seas, where 
normally very little life lives?

Well, if you lived on Cuba you would probably think it was reasonable. 
Besides, I got the impression the results were rather inconclusive.

My guess is that it is easier to influence systems with no strong 
positive feedback loops, especially chaotic ones. Hurricanes seem to be 
rather stable structures. Of course, if we can set up our own feedback 
loops (as with algae blooms), then we can get interesting abilities.

I don't think we can image it well yet, but in PET or FMRI scans it is 
visible as an activity increase in the visual cortices. Yes, there are 
several high-level cortices dealing with vision, and presumably the 
purple walrus will exist as activity in some of them. V1 (the "classic" 
visual cortex) deals mostly with what we really see (plus what our brain 
extrapolates from it), while V2-V5 seem to deal with various aspects of 
it (color, movement, edges etc). I think sensory information gradually 
gets integrated with general activity in the association cortices, and 
very hard to identify.

If you applied the right stimuli to V1 the person would see the walrus, 
but at higher levels the result would probably be more like suddenly 
envisioning it.

The only scientifically accurate one I know of, has started with 
1972-something, and counts seconds (alas, it's a 32-bit counter). If it 
comes to clustering, we should use a binary counter, this is most logical 
order I am aware of. (And it better had be a large one, let's count 
microseconds with a 128 bit counter).

Since we're going to have ubiguitous GPS/LPS systems, we'll soon be able 
to fix space at cm or better, and time at microsecond, or better anywhere 
on Earth or LEO.

Such knowledge is crucial for routing, whether material agents or data 
(geodetic routing).

Consider an augmented reality, with realtime 3d headup maps (DMD), and 
DGPS/Earth magnetic field/gravity tracking. These are things we'll have 
in a decade, or sooner. (Some of us, much sooner).

They might be not together impossible, but certainly very difficult. 
(Also, sometimes unethical).

Aw, come on. Stop harping upon things syntactical. Observation alone is 
no experiment, it needs recording and interpretation. Experiment without 
observation is no experiment, you could as well invent your data.

Yes, but there is a bandwidth. Physics and social sciences lie at the 
opposite side of the spectrum, obviously.

It is very difficult to obtain sensible results on extremely complex, 
ergodic systems. That's the reason why social science is a very difficult 
subject.

Okay I don`t really see this. Are you referring to the welfare state? If 
so, I disagree vehemently. Very few people are "loafers". There are some, 
but most people I know on welfare are doing everything in their power to get 
out. Those few that do leech off the system shouldn`t be the reason for 
letting those that need it starve.
I hate and fear government as much as anyone, but I also fear corporate 
tyranny, and as long as private interests are this selfish and greedy, I 
will pay my taxes to help out my fellow man.

No they wouldn`t, because the disparity in economics would eventually 
become so magnified these disenfranchised people would either die off, 
or get Marxist. If the power imbalance is enough, the "productive 
people", will have sufficient firepower to suppress any rallying effort 
by the masses.

I hope this is available to everyone, though. I think a rwandan farmer 
should have the same opportunity to become a nanogod as the CEO of some 
big company. I realize I`ve probably contradicted many extropian 
political opinions, but I do embrace the hope for technological 
advancement helping out all of humanity instead of just the rich.

It is. A von-Neumann probe has a negligeable size, loss of its mass would 
not be felt on system scale. Idea space is infinite, as the amount of 
states a system has is also a function of the number of atoms is contains. 

Unless computation can be detached from the material carrier, both mass 
and energy are scarce resources. A need for expansion seems logical. 
Since such expansion is not observable, we must assume a sequence of 
filters, or the transcendence scenario. Personally, I like the 
transcension scenario a lot better.

You are right, of course. But the intelligence of the atomic agents has 
remained a virtual constant. Only the degree of cooperation has 
increased. But we're talking about autofeedback loop upon both the number 
of agents _and_ grain size of their intelligence. With a very short time 
constant, on a week-to-month scale.

This is certainly unprecendented.

I recall reading, not too long ago, Science News most likely, something
about how measurements of people given some sort of imaging tasks showed
the same type of activity in the *retinal* processing areas as would
have occurred if the subject was actually viewing a real scene.  In
other words, there was some sort of feedback or projection from the
visual cortex *out to* the retinal areas, the opposite of the normal
stream of signals.

That said, I don't completely dismiss the possibility that there might

particular of David Krieger's discussion with David Ross in the 1994 3rd

completely agree with David Musick that "our minds and everything about

Perhaps my statement, "Maxwell's immortal demon, at last perhaps?" was
misinterpreted as implying a belief in magic or perpetual motion.  It
was supposed to be humorous.  I was trying to make the case that there
might be EXTROPIC forces that complement or sometimes counteract
ENTROPIC forces.

In fact, check out the 9/21/96 Science News where there is an article
describing how experiments with polystyrene spheres in water show that
entropy of particles at one scale can actually induce organization of
particles at another, larger scale.

My problem with Markov chains as a model for real-world processes (aside
from my naive undertanding of the mathematics involved, which was
clearly stated in my original post) is that (I think, correct me if I'm
wrong) they can only model discrete objects and don't allow for the
possibility of interaction with other objects at the time of state
transition.  While John K. Clark has nicely explained how random inputs
can be incorporated into the state-transition probabilities using
various stochastic distributions, I'm still not clear on whether these
can account for the types of intentional changes that humans, among
other living organisms can produce.

I think the problem we're really having here is what Reilly Jones
recently identified:
"It is an exceedingly common error to mix up ontology with epistemology,
with what is there, facts, with what we can know about them, our degrees
of uncertainty, if you will.  Facts are facts, two things don't happen
at the same moment, only one thing does.  We may see it dimly, or from
different perspectives, but only one thing happens at any given instant
of time."

Aside from the fact that many things *do* happen at the same time (as
Sarah Marr pointed out in her incisive response to Reilly), even from
one observer's perspective, there are also cases where we can have a
split perspective of the same individual thing.

Here's an example that physicist David Bohm (of 'holographic universe'
fame, or infamy to some) liked to use: Suppose there is a fish in a long
rectangular tank with a camera at one end and another camera on the
side.  Visitors to the aquarium only see two monitors, one of which
shows a fish swimming straight toward them, the other showing a fish
swimming laterally.  The observer could easily conclude that there are 2
fish when, 'in fact', there is only one.  Now, what happens to the
'fact' when we play a further trick by exchanging the fish for a
computer simulation of a fish?

I guess I can understand that there is a meaningful distinction between
what exists (ontology) and what we can know about what exists
(epistemology).  For example, I know that the Moon exists (unless it has
somehow been destroyed since last night and I haven't heard about it
yet) independently of my knowing it.  But, these are sort of macro or
constant facts.  In more dynamic situations, I have trouble seeing what
the use of ontology is - too many things we've never seen before have to
pass through our perceptual filters, and our knowledge of them is so
susceptible to distortion.  (Although, if I were blind and was hit by a
car I couldn't see while crossing the street, the existence of that car
would quickly become more important to me than my perception of it.)

To make a long story short, I think I'm saying that, in most dynamic and
novel situations, WE CANNOT 'SEE' THE FACTS DIRECTLY, only the portion
of those facts that makes it through our sensors and pattern-matching
routines.  While those portions may still be 'facts' in some ontological
sense, from a practical perspective they may amount to an illusion in
the limited context with which we interpret them.

While I don't quite follow it, and it's probably easy to misuse, I think
Ian Goddard's 'holistic logic' also makes this point that it's very
difficult to identify a distinct fact apart from the environment in
which it is embedded.  Yes, a tree that falls in the forest does make a
sound even if we are not there to hear it; but, how can that be a fact
*for us* (except perhaps through some vague, holistic  'butterfly

I think it is a great idea, we should always strive to broaden our areas 
of activity.

Yes, I do not understand this. Art has in the past together with science 
been one of the few truly liberating forces, and I think that will 
continue.

I have found one psychological concept very helpful here: learned
helplessness. If you try something repeatedly, but don't succeed
(especially if you have never experienced success in the first place), you
"learn" that you will never succeed, and don't even try anymore. This is 
IMHO a major problem facing us transhumanists in all areas - too many 
people are feeling helpless to do anything.

Learned helplessness is also the reason I do not fully believe that a 
free market will solve all problems - too many people are passive and 
will not act, even when it is clearly in their best interest (of course, 
a wellfare state can be said to promote this, but the problem remains 
even without them).

It's Nikola, not Nikolai, he was a Serbian from Lika (the name Nikolai
is seldom met in the Balkans), and he hasn't been dismissed as a
crackpot any more than your average neighbourhood genius.  In fact,
if there is any single person "responsible" for the existence of
computers through butterfly effect, it would be him: his work on
three-phase alternating current distribution made mass distribution of
electricity to homes feasible at the time.  Unlike T.A. Edison's light
bulb, a relatively miniscule fraction of the population knows anything
about it, yet its economical and social impact was several orders of
magnitude larger.  

The "crackpot" part usually creeps into popular biographies, fueled
mostly by Tesla's pitiable social skills.  A common compassion-inducer
in texts about him is that he "died alone in a hotel room."  Millions
of people do every year.  Not many can claim a hundredth of Tesla's
contribution to human knowledge.  The unit strength of magnetic field
in the SI system of units is called Tesla in his honor.
He had a truly outstanding mind.  He was also sending signals to
Martians. (Maybe he found out from a meteorite that landed in his back
yard? ;)

As we proceed closer to the millenium things are going to get stranger and
more bizarre due to religions predicting the end of the world which will
also stir up topics such as UFOs and psychic phenomenon which we are even
beginning to see leech into the extropian and transhuman newsgroups. It will
all pass and rationality will triumph but we must just wait for this time to
pass and attempt to become involved in this whole phylum of memes revolving
around the 2000 mark. 

To name a few:
Telekinesis
Telepathy
Spontaneous Combustion
UFO sightings & abductions
Huge Gov't Conspiracies

What am I forgetting?

The "second coming" !!

Also, it will be interesting to see the first two on the list become a
reality through technological innovations with nanotechnology and
brain-computer interfaces.

          I suppose that there could be SIs that were not 
          corporations, at least if you take "corporation" in a narrow 
          sense as implying an economic nature of the group. I think 
          the term "SI", i.e. Synthetic Intelligence, was introduced 
          as an alternatilve to "AI" in order not to prejudice the 
          question whether the intelligence would be based on the 
          principles of classical AI. In the present discussion I 
          think what we have meant by "SI" has been: an entity very 
          much more intelligent than humans or existing groups of 
          humans (which should be ">SI" or ">AI", unless we take "SI" 
          to stand for Super Intelligence, which would be convenient.)

Thank you Nadia. I intend the site to be a place where people can learn
about Transhumanist Art, who some transhuman artists are, and a bit about
our work.  I intend to show where different art genre's meet and where they
separate so that people can get a quick guide to its art history. This way
we won't lump all futuristic looking art as transhuman art when it is not
based on the ideas and intentions of transhumans.  This is important because
much contemporary art is deathist and angry, but utilizes interesting
technology. And it is important for us to have a least some sense of
sophistication about the genre we are participating in!  A transhuman making
art that is not transhuman -:)

I should let people know that it is under construction and that is why the
links aren't happening.  I haven't written the pages. I will be able to work
on it in two weeks.

I think this might be just the view of a few.  Certainly, by having a
Transhumanist Art list, anyone who does not have a strong background in art,
or art hisory and art theory can join in and learn.  This would be really
great and much needed.  Certainly, art has value and meaning.  How many
would join?  Well, perhaps a lot of artists!  Let anyone who isn't an artist
read the list guidelines and FAQ list to learn terms first to learn a few
references.  I find that some of previous confusion was because words are
used differently in different professions/disciplines and _also_ that, in
general, people have different reference points from which to draw ideas and
criticism.  If someone has never seen or read about a specific style of art,
how on earth can he or she discuss it intelligently?

Yes, I've heard about all sorts of cover-ups.  What I have not heard are 
good reasons to believe that many of them have *are* cover-ups.

I'm proud to say that I'm reading nothing but science books.  Because of 
my interest in science, I have a lot of trouble with the sort of 'evidence'

There's not much point in owning myself if I'm not worth much.  Most of my 
feelings of self-worth are based on an awareness that I try to think clearly, 
rationally, and skeptically.  I see no point at all in fantasizing 'enemies' 
just to make the prospect of self-ownership seem more precious.

Perhaps when i return you and I can sit down and see about starting a forum
for futurist art, you havent the time, and yet it is your concept in so many
ways... I am skeptical about the embryonic stage of the sci/art connections,
but yes, perhaps it is a way for people to ( if nothing else) lurk and learn
til they are ready to contribute ( which is what I did for the >H and
Extropian lists).

>> Certainly, art has value and meaning.  How many
would join?  Well, perhaps a lot of artists! 

   You are right! It may be a way to encourage artists to become interested
in Extropy.... we can use the brain power.

>> Let anyone who isn't an artist read the list guidelines and FAQ list to
learn terms first to learn a few references. I find that some of previous
confusion was because words are
used differently in different professions/disciplines and _also_ that, in
general, people have different reference points from which to draw ideas and
criticism.  If someone has never seen or read about a specific style of art,
how on earth can he or she discuss it intelligently?  
>>

I agree with you, but is a bit beside the point - exept for those few ( and
you know who you are) who speak *authoratively* on the subject when it is
quite clear they arent experts. 

I hope the scientists, social scientists, techwriters, programmers, engineers
and philosophers would also be freely encouraged to join in, on any level
they want - knowledge or none - as long as they arent *attacking* the
criteria.. 
After all, one will certainly find more engineers who know a little about art
history than artists who know a little about neurobiology. 
Personally  I find it much more interesting to learn from the technogeeks and
futurist philosophers, since I know a lot about art already!!

IAN: It's the same thing I've always stated: A is A only relative to ~A,
therefore ~A is a necessary feature of A, and thus the two are unified.

My description of this evolves over time, seeing as it's very hard to 
understand how two things can be same thing via indivisible dependence.

Despite the difficulty of comprehension, the truth of holistic unity is
established by literally unlimited physical examples, and evidence to the
contrary -- an example of A being A free from relation to ~A -- is nowhere 
to be found.  There is therefore no basis in physical fact or fact based 
logic to support the claim that A is separate from, or other than, ~A. 

Alas, I cannot compel others to see or to base their belief on physical 
fact,  but I can work to "guise" holistic logic in a more acceptable
package, necessitated also by the fact that my ability to describe is imperfect.

Yes, it was a pleasant surprise to see a video that's intellectually
stimulating, with a worthwhile soundtrack, and enough action to keep
one wide awake.  For more information see:
    http://www.manga.com/manga/
The background there will help explain what is happening in the movie.

I second the recommendation. 

A truly interesting film. When I saw it with Romana (it played at the San 
Jose Towne Theater for awhile), she gasped at one scene and exclaimed, 
"That's the best popular explanation of the information theory of personal 
identity I've seen!"

I have the (english-dubbed) video tape (Manga Video), and could arrange a 
screening on my new 35" TV. I also have the English-translated manga and 
Russell Whitaker recently gifted me with the Japanese language version 
(with a few extra near x-rated panels, wahoo!).

I've got a question, if a microwave tower was to fall and it was aimed
toward a residential zone instead of falling face down on the ground, could
it do damage to the individuals in the homes? Also another question I've
been pondering lately, the San Onofre (sp?) Nuclear Power plant in
California does it cause mutations in the local sea animals in the area due
to radiation trickling into the environment? If not now could it in maybe a
few decades due to the longer period of time for mutations to occur.

True but I want to be uploaded asap. Also through MRI scans, etc we could

Are there any other methods we could use other than HAARP to heat portions
of the atmosphere possibly less expensively? Also I heard long ago in
california someone (I don't recall who) proposed installing huge fans in the
mountains to blow smog out into the desert. Is that practical? Could it
actually be accomplished? I'm not sure anyone in the desert would like it
though.

Vitamin Research Products finally offers DHEA, and I have been taking it
in
the mornings at the 50 mg level for about a month. My best guess is that
it
provides a slight increase in wellbeing and libido. However I am doing a
rather thorough multi supplement regime (most of the OTC items in
Donaldson's
book on life extension substances) which is only 2 months old, so it is
very
hard to draw any conclusions. I have recently upped the dosage to 100mg
daily,
and it's too soon to tell yet. I am 51, definitely old enough to benefit
from
it.

      -*Thanks to Anders, Nadia and Natasha for your recent comments.*-


        From the optimistic comments I have received (and the pessemistic
comments I have *not* received) it would appear that there is an interest in
a transhuman\extropian art ML.  I guess it's time for me to get the pebble
rolling and see if it causes an avalanche :-)!  What I need from everyone
now is information on setting up a mailing list.  I'm sure David McFadzean,
Alex Bokov and Max More should have this information, but if anyone else has
any knowledge of setting up MLs, their input would be highly valued.  

        Step two will be links.  If anyone on either mailing list would not
mind creating a link to the ML (if it gets off the ground), that would be
appreciated.

        My general plan is that this ML will be a forum for TH, Extropian,
Futurist, immortalist etc. artists to collaborate, comment upon, and
critique each other's artwork.  I believe that there are many different
genres that are included in the term 'art'.  Some of these genres include
poetry, plays, visual artwork, sculpture, music, short stories, videos and
essays.

        I believe that an artist is a person who creates something that
reflects a piece of his\herself within a genre.  As an artist myself, I
believe that every time I create a piece of art, I am immortalizing an
emotion or feeling that I feel upon the moment of completion.  I think,
therefore I am; I believe, therefore I do.

        With the creation of this mailing list, I think that artists shall
be able to make their deepest and truest views open to their peers.

        Within the next little while, I will be researching ways of how to
create an ML, and what sort of avenues I will take to create pertinent
links.  I have started on an FAQ and introduction, but any suggestions and
contributions will be accepted with very open arms.  All in all, I would
appreciate your involvement and input regarding this matter, and hopefully,
it shall be successful.

Well, there we have it:  you don't want to address the fact that placing
the means of production into the hands of everyman and making the cost
of the means of production tend towards zero both completely undermine
the existing economic structures by removing the trade that drives them.
I don't need to *argue* that --- it should be obvious that trade is the
lifeblood of the economy.

Surely you don't want *that* argued, do you?

I'm puzzled at what you're trying to achieve by avoiding the issue.

Maybe we can test this out. To me, the web is approaching the point now
where you propose nanotechnology will be. The means of production isn't
perhaps free but it's pretty low considering you get worldwide distribution.

Now there's web services coming out where you use their programs or
other services saving yourself the trouble of writing cgi scripts. Why
not take this to the next step: where whatever data you want to present
you get from somewhere else and put your own interface around it. Every-
body becomes a server to some and a client to others. You could run
the whole thing with info-credits and take the whole info economy off
taxable dollars. (well, maybe)

Perhaps it's an economy of abundance, but the marketing types are still
thinking in terms of an economics of scarcity. I'm working on a website
now that will list numerous physical venues (niteclubs, museums, etc).
Some of these venues will have web sites.  The cost of including a
link to an outside web site is miniscule compared to what the marketing
types want to charge the venue for the link.

Does it make sense to compare a near-future information-based economy to
a later-future nanotech economy?

I think that the 'use' of ontology is as an understanding that somewhere 
out there lies whatever actually exists in the universe, behaving according 
to whatever rules it follows.  Can we be certain about any of these 
'facts'?  Maybe not.  But the less uncertain our knowledge is, the better 
our predictions get.  The only way to reduce the uncertainty of our 
epistemology to keep tinkering with it to more closely match ontology.

But the objective, then, should be to fight against that possibility.  We 
can enhance our senses artificially, and refine our pattern-matching 
routines.  That's what science is - a very refined system of pattern 
matching, which helps us make our epistemology somewhat better than a 
wild guess.  There are degrees of uncertainty, and there are means of 
reducing uncertainty.  All I'm saying is that we should embrace those 
methods, rather than assuming that any uncertain understanding is equally 
useful.  They're not.  We can do better, and should.

Our ignorance of something doesn't stop it from being true.  The burden is 
on *us* to find out what is actually going on, whether we can do so 
perfectly or not.  Telling ourselves that 'reality' is only whatever we 
happen to think it is at the moment is not helpful.

One thing to keep in mind is that it's best to take
DHEA under the toung. The LEF journal says that upto
90% of DHEA can be destroyed by the liver.  They
suggest braking open a capsule and holding the
powder under tounge for at least 60 seconds.
Surely a liquid sublingual variety should

IAN: Consider how a slight alteration to an "isolated" region 
of a canvas alters the character of the whole painting. A whole
paining my be thrown off balance by the slightest alteration in 
just one region of the painting. You've probably observed this.
Good design requires that all parts are connect harmoniously.

This is a measure of how the identity -- the color, intensity, 
shape, location, ... -- of each part alters the identity of the 
whole.  This is because identity is a holistic phenomenon, it 
exists only in the whole, and all identity is shared.  Just as 
a change to one portion of the whole alters the whole, it also 
changes the individual identity of each portion. As we make
one object in our painting larger, all others become small
relative to that object. All identity is relative in this
fashion.  There is no "private" identity.  Every part 
defines all other parts. It therefore follows that 
all parts are one. Like everything's one. |^)

Sorry, Ian, but that comes across as a ex post facto response which
undermines a lot if not all of your prior arguments. Internal dichotomy does
not remove the requirement for an external comparative.

Kathryn, unless I (and others) have misunderstood what you've been saying,
for quite some time now now you've been arguing in favour of using in
social studies, methods less formal than science advocates, while STILL
wishing to call the studies sciences --- in other words, you've been trying
to soften the strict foundations of science, or at least to muddy the
waters in such a way that a non-science can appear as a science.  Then
you quoted an item from Bart Kosko which seems to have only one purpose
in the context of this thread, namely to say (my paraphrase) "everything
is uncertain", this presumably being your way of finding backing for your
desired de-formalization of science to encompass social studies as well.

If the above is not the case then clearly I have got the wrong end of the
stick, and apparently others have too.  If so then please try to re-explain
and I'll try to reassess it.

Cheers,

Rich.

"So I suppose I'm actually agreeing with Eugene. He seems to think that there

I also agree that there is no point in elaborating the objective/subjective 
boundry, because I think the objective/subjective dichotomy is a ridiculous 
one to make.  In my arrogant opinion, everything is objective.  Even our 
thoughts are objective; they are actually happening.  My feelings are 
objective; I am actually feeling emotions.  That which we call our subjective 
experience is a *part* of the objective world, not something in *opposition* 
to the objective world.  The subjective is a subset of the objective; it's not 
the opposite of the objective.

And this doesn't mean that objective reality is whatever we think it to be, 
but it does mean that our fantasies and imagination are objective, in the 
sense that they are actually occuring inside our own heads.  It doesn't mean 
that our fantasies and imaginations will actually have any _literal_ effect on 
the world beyond our bodies, unless we use our bodies to carry out our 
fantasies, by doing it ourself or communicating our ideas to others (machines 
or humans) who then carry out our fantasies for us.

Again, the objective/subjective dichotomy is simply another invention of 
humans to irrationally place themselves in a realm outside the effects of the 
real world, to somehow separate themselves from objective reality.  It's 
amazing how stubborn that type of thinking is; it shows up all over the place, 
in many different disguises.

Now, I'm not saying that there is no subjective world; there certainly is; 
there are many billions of subjective worlds; I'm only saying that the 
subjective is not located in any magical fairy land; it's in our own heads, 
and all our experiences are parts of a much vaster, objective world.

The objective world is simply all that which exists, that which is actual.  
Our subjective experiences exist; we are actually experiencing (in fact, this 
is all we really know for sure -- that we are experiencing; everything else is 
inferred from our experiences).  Therefore, our subjective experiences are 
part of the objective world, and for us they're the only part of the objective 
world that we really know about, for certain.

Ian, I have no idea what gave you the notion that I adhere to the idea of 
non-relational identity.  It is blatently obvious to me that "things" exist 
only in relationship to each other.  I question the very idea of identity 
itself.  That's why I say it's all in your head, to categorize "things".  I 
think it's arbitrary to divide the world up into parts (and I'm not saying 
it's not useful to do so, just that it's arbitrary -- we could divide the 
world up differently).  

I think this is the result that you're coming to by saying that one "thing" 
exists only in relationship to the rest of all existence, not on its own; 
therefore every "thing" depends on the rest of existence for its own 
existence; therefore no one "thing" can truly be separated from ALL other 
"things".  You're basically saying that all existence is one thing.  Which 
means that it's arbitrary and just in our heads to categorize the world into 
separate "things", since there is only one thing, and it is everything 
together.  If this isn't what you're saying, please tell me, but I'm pretty 
sure this is what you mean.

I agree with you completely here.  All is One.  Sure, fine, that's great, BUT 
I don't see how this is useful AT ALL.  It's absolutely true, but utterly 
useless.  All is one, but all is not uniform.  The world has all kinds of 
features, and it is highly detailed.  Figuring out how the details work 
together is what's useful, not knowing that all these details are all part of 
the same thing, the ONLY thing.  Science is about mapping out the details of 
existence, and it is very useful.  Knowing that existence is all of one piece 
gives us no information about how the details work together.  The way we 
categorize the details is up to us; it is arbitrary, but some ways of 
categorizing the details of the world are more useful than others.  And 
finding these useful ways of thinking is what's truly of value.

I'm sorry if you're disappointed that the wonderful jewel of insight you 
thought you had is simply a worthless rock.  I'm curious to see your reaction. 
 Will you continue to cling to the rock and defend its value, or will you 
examine it more closely, realize its lack of value, get rid of it and find 
some truly useful ideas to take its place?  Although, your idea may provide 
you with a great deal of pleasure, and so it could be considered valuable in 
that respect, just not useful with regards to anything else.

OK, so it's 2am-ish and I've just got back from a night out clubbing. And on
the way home I was thinking: if I, er, 'physically interacted' with another
person in a virtual world, but the experience was identical to the real
world except that I _knew_ it was only virtual, would that lessen the
experience?

Thoughts?

If one includes ones own future self within the set designated by "ones
children" then one can interpret Hara's remarks as they would apply to
someone who has no gametic offspring, and they still make sense.

Deathists tend to identify with their genetic offspring (and sometimes, as
in the case of Nietzsche, with their memetic offspring) because they are
convinced of their own mortality. Since you disagree with them about that
conviction, you might as well adjust their terms for them accordingly when
you are trying to interpret and make sense of what they say. I'm not saying
Hara is a deathist (I know better than that!), but we have these
assumptions built into our language still, and it will take a while for
them to vestigiate.

Wow! I was almost ready to agree with your post 100% (in which case this
would have just been a "me too" post) until I got down to the last clause.
I think it's important to acknowledge that introspection can be just as
fallible as our other sensory modalities. This isn't *very* fallible (I
think natural selection has provided human beings with a finely honed set
of sensorics), but it is fallible to some extent. And probably there has
been a lot less selection pressure to improve the accuracy of our
introspections than there has been to improve the accuracy of our vision,
hearing, ability to sense heat and cold, etc. For this reason, I'd even go
so far as to say that our introspective senses are probably more fallible
than our "extrospective" senses.

I've more than once had the experience of being told that I was angry, of
vigorously denying that I was angry, and then of realizing (from listening
to tone of my voice in my vigorous denials) that the other person was
right. Accuracy of perception seems to be related to focus of attention,
and most of us keep our attention focused on the external world most of the
time, for good reason.

That last clause in your post reintroduces the whole subjective/objective
dichotomy that you spent most of your post demolishing. By asserting that
we are more certain in our knowledge of our personal subjective worlds than
we are in our knowledge of "objective reality", you make the dichotomy
meaningful again. But quite frankly, I think the reliability of my
knowledge of my internal psychological states is no better and no worse
than the reliability of my knowledge of the external world. (In both cases,
my knowledge is reliable enough for my purposes so far.) But both kinds of
knowledge can be improved: we shouldn't take either kind for granted.

A recent report in New Scientist describes a `blindsighted' subject whose V1
is inoperative but who can still detect fast (but not slow) motion within
the visual field.  This is processed directly by V5.  I'm not sure if this
subject *experiences* the motion `visually', since many blindsighters insist
that they're blind as bats yet when asked to `guess' manage to be right way
too often.  So this is presumably a neurologically different process from
the optional hallucination/transduction process induced by `aura reading'.

On 9/25/96, Sarah Marr had some comments on my post of 9/24/96.  I didn't see
much worth responding to at the time, following Samuel Johnson's maxim that "It
is impossible to criticize unresisting imbecility."  But, unfortunately, Mark
Crosby, in his post of 9/27/96 offered this assessment of Sarah's post: "Aside
from the fact that many things *do* happen at the same time (as Sarah Marr
pointed out in her incisive response to Reilly)."  If her response is viewed as
incisive, and if someone else thinks many things happen at the same time, then I
will, altruistically, offer up some comments and suggestions of my own.

Sarah Marr: <If I'm right, then more than one thing can happen at any given
instant of time.>

If two utterly contradictory events occur at the exact same time, and at the
exact same place, then you must explain how there can be such a concept of truth
at all.  How can there be unique history?  What kind of a rational world would
you construct, that did not contain a law of non-contradiction?  Why would you
expect a scientific experiment to ever be repeatable?  How could anything be
intelligible at all?  Most certainly, many different things happen with
frequency, but not in the same exact place, at the same exact time, this is
conceptual drivel.  I didn't both send my post and not send it at the same time,
I, in fact, and in truth, sent it.  Columbus didn't both discover America in
1492, and vacation on the French Rivieria at the same instant.

What I see here, in combination with your later comments on "feelings,"
"happiness," and "toleration" (which I will address down below), I take to be
the result of good dollops of scientific nihilism, historical revisionism, and
cultural relativism.  Good scientists aren't really nihilists.  Confused
scientists who mistake their models of random activity at the smallest scales
for an ontological primitive are nihilists.  They mix up ontology with
epistemology.  Scientific models built around the concept of randomness are
epistemological in nature, not ontological.  Ontologically, random activity
equates to nothing.  Yet here we are.  Randomness resides strictly in our brain,
as a concept that has great utility to us by patching over our ignorance of
causes, but could hardly make sense ontologically.

I will recommend a good book to cure these conceptual diseases.  "The Killing of
History:  How a Discipline is Being Murdered By Literary Critics and Social
Theorists", by Keith Windschuttle (1996) was recently reviewed in the "The New
Criterion" (September 1996).  Some blurbs from the review: "Having lived among
the natives, Mr. Windschuttle has sampled much local fare; he knows all about
curiosities like semiotics, and how they got to be that way; he understands the
chief local dialects, and can discriminate nicely between structuralism and
post-structuralism, deconstruction, post-colonialism, and social-constructivism;
he knows the best way across the desert of Michel Foucault's 'anti-humanism' and
is adept at extricating himself from the swamp of postmodern literary theory;
above all, he arms his readers against the cranks, charlatans, and intellectual
shysters that populate these environs:  he has sage advice for dealing with
purveyors of radical skepticism and scientific relativism, as well as
commonsense tips for avoiding those who pretend that history is merely a species
of fiction."  IMO, rational individuals should be armed against all these forms
of irrationality, such as Sarah's idea that contradictory events can occur
simultaneously.

Mr. Windschuttle writes: "In the 1990s, the newly dominant theorists within the
humanities and social sciences assert that it is impossible to tell the truth
about the past or to use history to produce knowledge in any objective sense at
all.  They claim that we can only see the past through the perspective of our
own culture and, hence, what we see in history are our own interests and
concerns reflected back at us.  The central point upon which history was founded
no longer holds:  there is no fundamental distinction any more between history
and myth....  [But] the study of history is essentially a search for the truth."
What these theorists say about history is also what they say about science.
That's why there's an increasing amount of pseudo-science being conducted today,
along with the overwhelming amount of pseudo-history.  Those who think two
contradictory events can occur at the same place, and at the same time, in the
words of the reviewer: "...abandon the constraints of empirical truth in the
name of liberation.  But what they wind up with is not freedom but a new and
more terrible servitude."  We end up with tribes of gangsters hacking each other
over turf, in a will-to-power frenzy, what Mr. Windschuttle calls "charnal house
politics."

If truth is relative, and history is myth, then, of course, we are liberated to
fabricate identities for ourselves, fabricate cultures for our fellow travelers,
then demand recognition by the diverse cultures of the world at large for the
legitimacy of these made-up identities and cultures, and go after those cultures
who are not inclined to grant us legitimacy because to do so would be to deny
their own identity and their own culture.  A big multicultural fight, concrete
anarchy, meaning destruction, not abstract anarchy, meaning freedom.

RJ: <Really, tolerance in practice is simply indifference.  To tolerate
something is to be indifferent to it, meaning it does not threaten your person
or your way of life (which is nearly inseparable from your person) and holds no
interest to you.>

SM: <A lot of tolerance involves 'putting up with' something which does
affect your way of life, and which you are not indifferent to.>

I cannot understand this.  If something, really I should say someone, affects
your life, they either a) help you, or b) hinder you.  Neutral intentions or
actions have no effect on your life.  Individuals tolerate neutral intentions or
actions, that is, they are indifferent to them, which is also a form of
disapproval or patronization.  Individuals welcome intentions or actions which
help them, this is the basis for consensual moral polities, for approval or
respect, not tolerance.  Individuals fight against intentions or actions which
hinder them, they do not tolerate them.  Servility is not tolerance.

SM: <...toleration is based on the balancing of feelings of the individual, for
hir own personal happiness. These are personal decisions based on personal
feelings, they do not require recourse to the concept of group-worth.>

I am not an adherent of emotivism.  If toleration is to be held up as a virtue,
as something of high worth, I cannot detect a coherent philosophy behind its
foundational "feelings" as pointing to the Good.  I do know, that under a system
of cultural relativism, that the similar virtue of "justice" is the avoidance of
hurt feelings, and nothing more.  It certainly is not the righting of wrongs,
since right and wrong don't exist, except insofar as you "feel" they do.  What's
your definition of "justice," in such a "feeling" driven worldview?  Why is
"happiness" important?  Does "happiness" point to the Good also?  Or is
"happiness" the Good itself?  Why should we care about "feelings" or "happiness"
at all?  If tolerance of others is based on "feelings," then is intolerance of
others equally acceptable, as long as it is equally based on "feelings"?  Why or
why not?

SM:  <...none of us has to agree to anything, do we?>

Only if we decide to opt completely out of social life.  Are we still human
then?  In what sense?  This sounds like an expression of vacant freedom to me,
devoid of content.

SM: <It's not a question of a threat to the person or to one's way of life,
that's too simplistic. It's to do with the nature of that threat, and a
personal balancing of priorities and desires.>

I'm a simple kinda guy.  Desires aren't balanced, they're indulged or denied.
Remember, only one thing at a time happens.  Priorities are hierarchical, not
balanced at all.  Priorities always point upwards to the Good, ultimately to the
highest Good.  Different conceptions of the highest Good, that is, human ideals,
are quite often irreconcilable, "toleration" in such cases is conceptually
incoherent, if you tolerate your destroyers, there will soon be no way for you
to "honor diversity."  There is no way to produce individuals who all aim for
reconcilable ideals, or harmonious worldviews, unless humanity's volitional
freedom is engineered out.  This is the perennial utopian effort to reshape
humanity, that has led to such devastating effects this century.

RJ: <I get the creeps any time I see the word "tolerance" any more.  The word
has been badly abused by the holier-than-thou politically correct brigades, who
virtually always mean "intolerance" when they use it.  Likewise, when they say
"inclusive," they mean "exclusive"; when they say
"multicultural," they mean "monocultural"; when they say "open-minded," they
mean "closed-minded"; and when they say "diversity," they mean "perversity.">

SM: <I don't believe you. Please give some concrete examples to prove your
point.>

Well, since you think that it's possible for two contradictory events to occur
at the same place, and at the same time, I have no clue as to what you would
consider "proof" to be.  I suppose, from your emphasis on "feelings" and
"happiness" above, that proof might be whatever you feel happy about.  In the
presence of relative truth and mythological history, why bother with proof at
all?  Why not just assert, and associate only with those who assert in harmony
with you?  Do you ascribe to Richard Rorty's definition of truth, that it's
whatever our peers will let us get away with?  What sources of proof do you give
authority to?  To personal experience?  Well, I have personally experienced what
I wrote, I understand that you have not, because you say "schools in the US are
not within my sphere of knowledge," and this has been where my primary
experience has been of this nasty cultural war.  I offer my personal experience
as proof, but why should you believe me, especially after you've read this
unflattering post, which you may not "feel happy" about?  On what basis do you
grant authority to individuals, in the area of proofs?

OK, personal experience is a feeble and lame source of proof, if we had to rely
on personal experience, no cumulative human knowledge would be possible.  Let's
turn to reflection.  The organically linked set of values encompassed by
tolerance, inclusive, multicultural, open-minded, and diversity, all are derived
from a worldview that says that all human ideals can be harmonized, that One
World universal rational cooperation is achievable.  But this worldview is
utopian and deadly, because it is false.  All human ideals are not compatible,
hence, such a worldview must push its adherents into crushing or remaking all
individuals with incompatible ideals.  Hence, the true set of values for those
with this worldview, as opposed to the deceptive values, are intolerance,
monocultural, closed-minded, and perversity.  These are the true values that the
politically correct brigades of utopian do-gooders consistently show in
practice, while mouthing their opposite for public relations purposes.  The
individuals who have not been on the receiving end of the do-gooders' wrath and
hatred, often do not understand what the big deal is.  They are sleep-walking,
as we are "slouching to Gomorrah," in the words of Robert Bork.

An excellent book on the conceptual development of this utopian worldview, and
its inherent irrationality, is "The Crooked Timber of Humanity: Chapters in the
History of Ideas," by Isaiah Berlin (1990).  I don't recommend many recent
history books, but this is a good one.  Berlin is a champion of polycentrism (or
limited sovereignties), of individual liberty, of the uniqueness of human
consciousness, and an enemy of utopianism, of relativism, of revisionism, of One
Worlders.

Sarah again: <I don't believe theories predict what will happen, they only
predict what might happen. Otherwise they wouldn't be theoretical.>

Theories predict, not what "might" happen, which could be anything, but what the
experimenter *expects* to happen, with suitable definitions of what constitutes
an observation, rules for statistical inference spelled out, confidence
intervals, measurement accuracy, etc.  Otherwise, the theory would be just a big
bag of nothing.

Sarah again: <To say observation needs a theory behind it is not true.
Observation often leads to discovery: it is an error of causality to say
observation _must_ have some theory behind it; it is quite possible for the
theory to evolve from the observation.>

You cannot observe anything at all without your brain performing some perceptual
categorization prior to pattern recognition.  This is automatic theorizing on
the part of your brain.  Your brain categorizes on value, that is, value to you
personally.  Once you have recognized a pattern, because you associatively
connect your perceptual categorization to your memories, then you have made an
observation that you could possibly transmit to others, if you speak a common
language.  If you are doing Western science, you belong to a common moral
polity, with consensual values and rules for behavior.  When you observe
something in tandem with others, you must speak the same theory-laden language
and come to a consensus as to what you have observed.  Scientific breakthroughs
often come because individuals have unique internal values, and have unique
theories or perceptual categorizations (think of qualia) even though observing
the same phenomenon; thus, different patterns may be recognized, even though the
external event is the same.  One event at one time, that is, not two or more
contradictory events.  See my "Consciousness" review-essay in Extropy #14 for
additional details and sources.

Is it not possible for someone to help you with regard to one aspect of
your values while simultaneously hindering you with regard to some other
aspect of your values?

For instance, you might publicly show me up in an argument by revealing
some fallacy in my thinking, which would hinder me by damaging my
reputation as a cogent thinker while at the same time help me by revealing
the fallacy and allowing me to improve my thinking. Do these two aspects
taken together form an overall help or an overall hindrance? That's a
difficult question... I suspect it would depend on the situation.

But even if I decided it was a hindrance (for instance, because the mistake
in question was not a very important one), I'd probably choose to be
tolerant of such things.

As for your assertions about "only one thing can happen at a time", do you
disagree that there are many computations being carried out in different
parts of the brain simultaneously at any given moment? That is, do you deny
parallelism and think that cognition only occurs at the focus of attention
and that the human brain is not capable of "background processing", as it
were?

I apologize to this list for this discussion involving me getting so

something Eugene wrote without realizing that I was replying to this 
list.  And now, I can only interpret this post by Rich as a continuing 
attack on the social sciences that began on the transhumanist list 
and has migrated to this list.

My use of Bart Kosko's quote was to supplement my own spontaneous 
poetics on the nature of knowledge, which I now realize was a mistake 
to have posted to this list.

I don't make any apologies for being a student of the social 
sciences, and I fail to understand how my own estimation of the 
methodologies of the social sciences undermines the methodologies of 
the "hard" sciences.   My own contention has always been that 
different types of knowledge require different tools of measurement 
and analysis.

Having said that, I now exit this discussion.

I honestly remain confused as to your meaning.  Social science

This is not obvious to me, as I don't know what you mean by

Rather than continuing to throw out new distinctions, please just pick

IAN: The whole (A, ~A) is the whole relative to the parts. The 
parts are said to be "not-whole." So that answers your counter: 

                   whole = (whole + not-whole)

The whole is internally relative, ipso facto.  The point your counter
misses is that, according to holistic logic, there is no external area. 
If we found an area external to the whole, it would become internal to 
the whole.  Dichotomy is all holistic logic describes, predicts, and 
requires. I fail to see the relevance of your "ex post facto" stipulation.

The only contradiction to holistic identity would be a whole or thing, 
that is what it is free from dichotomy. I've shown that dichotomy is 
always the basis of identity.  You've yet to show where dichotomy is 
not the basis of identity. Your suggestion that holistic logic requires 
that there be some anti-whole is satisfied by the fact that "the part" 
is the "anti-whole," and accordingly the two are one.

There is zero inconsistency here, dichotomy is a constant. I am 
still waiting for evidence of the identity free from dichotomy.

Let us also recall that each step of the filter has a size.  An
argument that might be sufficient for saying the some of the filter
lies at any one point might be insufficient for saying that all of it
lies there.  Even if you persuade me that only one in ten star systems
cares about actually seeing the distant universe up close, that still
leaves a ten to the twenty filter to be explained.  

Though I said this before, let me also repeat that discount rates are 
evolutionarily endogenous.  Our discount rate is not biased relative
to the context where it evolved.  And with competition, we should
expect future discount rates to track the local growth rate.  And
limits to growth are hit, agents should care about farther and farther
into the future.  There really are academic papers on this sort of thing.

Where do you folks think intelligence, the ability to solve mental
problems, resides?  If we talk about speeding up brains, well those
are just faster brains of the same intelligence.  If we talk about
improving brains by giving them better software, i.e. better concepts
and insights, well that is just brains of the same intelligence who
know more.  Somewhere you think that there is some special central
quality that remains fixed now, but will suddenly explode to higher and
higher levels once agents can hack their hardware.

Maybe, but maybe also what makes us smart is bascially what we know
and how fast we can think - maybe there isn't much more that matters.
If so, the ability to hack hardware will bring a big one-time jump in
raw speed, which will slow down into diminishing returns as most of
the easy speedups are found.  And maybe if there are some qualitative
improvements possible in "basic intelligence", they won't be at all
easy to find.

And Nanotechnology without AI would be automated in the manufacturing process 
too, that is it could duplicate any existing object. If you have a good 
description of an object then you could make another one, and if you don't  
then Nanotechnology can examine the object and get a detailed description.  
Again let me repeat there is no reason to suppose that AI will not come along  
with Nanotechnology, but we can do a lot even without it. 

Engineers have a good description of automobiles, yet as you point out, to 
turn that description into a working car takes a lot of intelligent people 
that have learned a lot of difficult skills. Exactly what is it about 
Nanotechnology  that is so different from conventional manufacturing that it 
makes all that unnecessary?  I can think of 6 reasons:
                  
1) The parts a car factory uses are very expensive, the parts that 
   Nanotechnology  uses are very cheap.
                  
2) A car factory uses many thousands or millions of different types of parts   
   and you must learn how to operate all of them. At the most, Nanotechnology   
   uses 92 different parts (the elements) but in the real world almost 
   everything we know is made of less than 20, less than 10 parts for life.
                  
3) All the many different parts the factory uses are fragile, and fragile in   
   different ways, you must learn the proper handling techniques for them all   
   or you will destroy the parts before you can use them. There is no way you 
   can damage the parts Nanotechnology deals with.
                  
4) None of the parts the factory uses are absolutely identical. Despite our   
   best efforts, individual variation still exists, and so we must treat them    
   differently and compensate for the variation in the assembly process if we    
   want the finished product to work properly, that often takes intelligence.    
   On the other hand, according to the laws of Physics one hydrogen atom is    
   absolutely identical to another hydrogen atom and can be treated in    
   exactly the same way. Atoms have no scratches on them to tell them apart.
                  
5) Nanotechnology can manipulate matter without ever leaving the digital  
   domain, and I think most of us know the advantage of that. You may have to     
   deal with a rod 27 atoms long, or 28 atoms long, but you never have to     
   worry about a rod  27.5601334 atoms long.
                  
6) Most of the parts a factory uses are very complex and the ways they    
   interact with other parts are even more complex. Think of the windshield    
   of a car, it interacts poorly with the engine block, and even with the  
   windshield frame the interaction must be managed with great skill or you    
   will have a disaster. Nanotechnology is like building with leggo blocks, 
   you can build structures of arbitrary complexity, yet there are only a few    
   different types of blocks and they interact with other blocks in only a    
   few different ways. It's easy to develop an algorithm to examine any leggo   
   object and then build a duplicate, it's very far from easy to find an  
   algorithm that would do the same with a car.    
                           

                >There are many points where a decision has to be made by                 
                >somebody who has an understanding of the project as a whole                 
                          

Then complex things would never get made by humans. No one man, no ten men  
have a deep understanding of an airliner or a microprocessor or the software 
that lets it do interesting things, it's too great for one mind to grasp, 
at least a mind as puny as a human.  
                          

                >and who understands the purpose of his activity.                  


The purpose of his activity is to make money, but that's even more complex  
than manufacturing because not even a billion men understands the economy  in 
any depth.  In spite of our lack of understanding we still manage to build 
things.

Depends on how tight the specification is, by some standards one person is 
much like another, but if that specification is not tight enough for your  
taste try ants. Every worker ant or bee in a colony (the vast majority) is  
identical to every other  one, and she is more complex than any machine a  
human has ever made, so far. The queen can manufacture hundreds of workers a 
day if she receives enough food, and queen ants and bees are very dumb.  

True, there might be some very tiny variation in workers development, even  
though they have identical genes, but no manufacturing process is perfect and   
2 workers would be far more similar than any 2 cars coming off the same  
assembly line.

Certainly.  Fortunately, you have clarified the priorities of your life, you
have a coherency of values clustering around your highest purposes, which
support each other.  This has allowed you to refine your judgments with
experience, to have honed your emotional acuity, your powers of discrimination.
The fine art of compromise, so essential to civilization, comes into full play
here, this is what makes life so interesting.  You'll know when you've been
helped overall vs. hindered.

Of course, if you have incoherent values, or are tugged in opposing life
directions, then you're just bobbing on the waves anyway.

Ha ha!  Situational ethics, the NEA's biggest support for statist miseducation

EHF: <But even if I decided it was a hindrance (for instance, because the

Exactly, you only tolerate unimportant intentions or actions.  The tolerated
know they are unimportant.  It's very grating to them.

EHF: <As for your assertions about "only one thing can happen at a time", do you
disagree that there are many computations being carried out in different parts
of the brain simultaneously at any given moment?>

Assertion, huh?  Does this indicate that you also think that two contradictory
events can occur at the same place, at the same time?  Sheesh!  Where could
objectivity arise if this were the case?  I disagree that any computations at
all take place in the sense I think you are using the word.  I agree that when I
think 1 + 1 = 2, that a computation has occurred in my brain, subjectively, of
course, since there is no way for anyone to look into my brain and "know" what I
just did, with certainty.  Of course, I can't simultaneously do the computation
1 + 1 = 2 and 1 + 1 = 3, not at the exact same time, although I suspect some
gifted accountants may be able to do it.  As to computations at the molecular,
or atomic, or sub-atomic level, which is what I think you are referring to here,
they are epistemological models we impose on whatever is actually going on in
there, most likely just bits of stuff bumping around in preferred directions,
the path of least resistance and all.  Yes, this stuff is bumping all around in
the brain, but not contradictory events at the same place, at the same time.

EWF: <That is, do you deny parallelism and think that cognition only occurs at
the focus of attention and that the human brain is not capable of "background
processing", as it were?>

Not at all.  Searle's concept of the "background" is very useful.  So is
Gelertner's "spectrum of attention" in "The Muse in the Machine".  I believe
that the centrality of attention, has to do with the fact that motor action is
sequential, because time is sequential.  PET's and SQUID's have shown very
fascinating shifting patterns of activity over wide areas of the brain, but if
you take a snapshot at an instant of time, the scans don't produce two pictures
showing totally opposite areas of activity, the scans produce one picture,
showing one event at one place.  Of course, the time it takes to process the
pictures is much longer than the Planck moment time scales, so the pictures

Well, if you only read science books, then whatever reasons there are 
for believing that cover-ups exist would not come to your attention, 
right?

I've been taking DHEA since April of last year.  In February of this 
year I started taking Deprenyl, aka selegiline.  The only definite effect 
I can testify to is that I sleep less.  Subjectively, my thoughts seem to be 
clearer, but this may be an illusion.  The last couple of years have not 
been a period of great creativity.  I'm basically working on ideas that 
date back to the late 80s and early 90s.  

Michael Butler:

It's available by prescription.

Bobbers on the waves are not likely to send SWAT teams crashing through my
door, nor are they likely to organize for higher taxes and more
regulations, so I'm reluctant to condemn them as harshly as you do.

The people I worry about are the people who insist (like you do) upon moral
certainty, resolve, and activity, but who (unlike you) value an
authoritarian rigidly-ordered society. You and I both value a free society.
You see a free society as a society that does not tolerate violence or
expropriation. I see a free society as a society that tolerates everything
*except* violence and expropriation.

This remark simply demonstrates that Extropian posts can be written 
by entities with less-than-human intelligence.  I think there must be 
some kind of automated factory which generates these posts.  As John 
Clark said, 

> Human judgment is not involved whenever one post needs to be

Robin is not the one who is evading the issue.  Rich, you have not 
demonstrated that the means of production will be easy and cheap to 
produce.  You have not calibrated the idea of "placing the means of 
production into the hands of everyman."  

If you could demonstrate that Extopian Nanotech will exist, then yes, 
obviously this would change the economic system.  But you don't even 
try to demonstrate your thesis, you just keep asserting it in 
capital letters.  You could post it in 36 point type, it would still be 
just an unsupported assertion.

I began my last post on this subject with this statement:  

> I agree that some kind of momentous, unprecedented event is imminent.  

But the thing is, I have always had this expectation.  Even when I was a 
little boy, long before I knew anything about science or computers, 
I had a sense of imminent doom, or imminent transformation, or 
some kind of momentous event.   And I'm not the only one.  People 
have been expecting some kind of apocalypse for thousands of years.  

About 700 B.C., Isaiah wrote

In 40 B.C. Virgil wrote his Fourth Eclogue, a prophetic vision of 
a time when there is no need for trade, because every land produces 
everything in abundance, and there is no need to dye wool, because 
the sheep themselves grow wool in all colors... 

Maybe "The Singularity" is an archetype wired into our brains, 
and in every generation we try to make the facts fit our expectations.  

I used to indulge myself in apocalyptic thinking.  Now I tend to 
maintain a certain detachment.  I watch myself having apocalyptic 
thoughts.  

But, as Anders says, not everyone will maintain such detachment:  
> This widespread premonition of a great upheaval/transcendence 
> will influence their actions ...  
> And if everybody expects something to happen, it will happen - 
> it is just a matter of self-fulfilling prophecies. 

It is interesting to speculate on what might be accomplished 
if somebody set out to make use of the "self-fulfilling prophecy" 
phenomenon, to achieve his own purposes...   <evil g>

John, if you uploaded yourself into better hardware, you would just

IAN: Here's some really good reasons to believe they are cover ups:

        OKLAHOMA BOMBING COVER UP 

        1. I don't know what you call a cover up, but the FBI 
        kept private investigators out of the Murrha building
        in OK City, then quickly blew it up and within a few
        days had all the remains -- still viable evidence -- 
        buried at the BFI Waste Systems land fill. To make
        sure it didn't look like a cover-up, they erected a
        fence around the landfill and posted armed guards
        who prevented all private investigators from even 
        entering the site. This is a cover up ipso facto.


        2. Fabrication of evidence is a cover up of the 
        truth. Associated Press 04/10/96 (emphasis added):

            Prosecutors agreed to turn over letters 
            from FBI agent Frederic Whitehurts, who 
            tested Mr. McVeigh's cloths for traces 
            of explosives. Mr. Whitehurst has claimed 
            that investigators FAKED evidence in the 
            bombing case.      ^^^^^ 

        Right there, cover up -- an investigator comes
        forward and admits it. Now Mr. Whitehurst fears
        intimidation for his "spilling of the beans." Did
        you hear much about this in the media? There are
        at least a dozen other examples in this case alone.


        COCAINE / CONTRA COVER UP

        Associated Press, 09/23/96

        ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) - Activist Dick Gregory 
        and two others were arrested Monday in a protest 
        at the Drug Enforcement Administration after 
        demanding release of information on when the 
        agency first learned of allegations that U.S.
        -backed Nicaraguan rebels were shipping 
        cocaine to the United States. 

        They were joined at the protest by former DEA 
        agent Celerino Castillo III, who said he filed 
        reports documenting how in the mid-1980s, the 
        U.S.-backed Nicaraguan Contras were raising
        money buy funneling crack cocaine to inner- 
        city gangs in Los Angeles. 

 --->   Castillo sought, without success, release of 
        his own investigative files on the matter....
        despite reports from Castillo and others, the 
        government did nothing to stop the alleged 
        drug-running. 
        
One could fill books with evidence/proof of govt cover up. Hell, govt
is one solid cover up of the fact that central planning is a constant 
failure, yet they conspire [not that word] everyday to force more and 
more of it down our throats.  This should be known to all extropians.


  >I'm proud to say that I'm reading nothing but science books.  
  > Because of my interest in science, I have a lot of trouble 
  > with the sort of 'evidence' generally cited in support of 
  > conspiracy theories.

IAN: If your reading no evidence about govt conspiracy -- the not
doing of which you claim to be proud of -- then how can you in the 
same breath reject this evidence you proudly ignore ???  Is such 
a priori rejection of evidence what they teach in science books ?


  > There's not much point in owning myself if I'm not worth much.  
  > Most of my feelings of self-worth are based on an awareness that 
  > I try to think clearly, rationally, and skeptically.  I see no

IAN: Fear if illness and disease is a logical basis for valuation of 
health.  There are diseases out there that "want" to get us.  So to,
there are tyrants out there that want your freedom, wealth and labor.
You'd be wise to fear them and foolish to ignore them. Because enough 
people ignore the available evidence / proof of  govt cover up and 
atrocity, they will be slowly divested of more and more of both 
their  liberties and  properties even as these govt funded 
acts of atrocity form the very pretext for such loses.

Some years ago NASA needed quantities of sweat for studies in how to
keep the air in space capsules breathable. Volunteers wore a plastic
suit and rode excercise bikes. The cost - about $500/pint!

First it was length. Then it was width. Then it was skill. Then it was

There are a number of high pressure phases of water, including a few
which are
solid at room temperature. It is often suggested as an alternate means
of cryonic
suspension. When I was at the Alcor festival I spoke with someone who
had worked
with an apparatus capable of creating these. The project is currently
inactive and
quite a few important physical questions need study. For example, if a
sample were
compressed and then cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature, would it
remain metastable
when the pressure was released. On warmup, would the expansion be abrupt
(ie, is
it really a bomb?).

On a lighter side, I was on a boat in Alaska in a fjord and snagged some
glacier ice.
The trapped air fizzled when the ice melted (A lot like Hot Rocks from
the convenience
store, which is CO2 trapped in sugar). I read once of a business
failure, which was to
ship glacier ice to bars around the country as a novelty item.

Rather than condemn them, which, IMO, is a form of blaming the victim, I would

bobbing, which only plays into the hands of the elites, who desire servility
below them.  Tolerance of servility does not contribute to this.

I suppose I prefer to place my personal emphasis on intolerance of
authoritarian violence rather than on intolerance of servility. It just
seems like a more direct approach to me.

What a lovely way of putting it.  What about if the genders were

Old ground, Ian. And with 141 messages from the lists yesterday, I don't

Let's just agree to disagree. I can't see us getting any further, and on the

Congratulations. I think you've won a prize for the most unpleasant and ad
feminam comment I've ever read on this or the >H list.

Generally, however, I'd say you should be more keen to respond. My
experience of this list is that people always speak out if the disagree with
something, but don't if they simply agree. So I would have interpreted a
lack of responses to my original mail as agreement by the list, not
disagreement (and hence disagreement with you).

<big snip>

Where did I, or you, mention contradicatory events? Where did I, or you,
mention the same place? What, in short, are you talking about? There's
nothing to stop two events occuring at the same time. It's not surprising
you can refute a claim by me, if you suddenly assert that I've added two
extra clauses about place and contradiction. But feel free to counter _my_
argument, which has no recourse to those latter two concepts.

Nope. They may help you in some ways, and hinder you in others. Then it's a
balancing act. If you don't believe this, then just come up with a coherent
rebuttable of each of the examples I gave in my last mail, and that'll be fine.

Yeah, I always disapprove of things about which I'm indifferent. I mean, what?

I don't remember doing that. I just tried to explain what toleration

I base the answers to these questions on feelings, so you wouldn't accept
them anyway.

Why >or why not?

You're confusing the feelings which _are_ tolerance and intolerance with
feelings _about_ tolerance and intolerance.

An individual's feelings include tolerance and intolerance, but that
individual's feelings _about_ tolerance and intolerance may differ, to the
point of opposition, i.e. it is valid for an individual to feel that
tolerance is a good thing whilst feeling that intolerance is a bad thing.
Personally, however, I don't attach such value judgements to tolerance or
intolerance: i.e. I would not make a blanket statement that tolerance is
good. I choose to tolerate some things, and not tolerate others.

Nope. All I'm saying is we don't 'have to' agree to anything. Personally, I
think it would be stupid to always disagree, and generally I'm a fairly
agreaable person, I think. But I could always take a call to be continually
bloody-minded and accept the resulting isolation.

I love X. I hate Y. I want to have sex with Z. At the same time. Why not?

Sure. But my balance would place diversity above being destroyed, so I

Proof-schmoof. I was using the word in it's everyday way, not with any deep

>...a worldview that says that all human ideals can be harmonized...

There are certain things I believe in and of which I will seek to gain
acceptance from others. But I will do that with cogent argument, and allow
those others to make up their own minds. And if a majority agree maybe
things will change. Everybody else should have the same chance to put their
point of view. So it is those listening who change human ideals, not those
talking.

OK. Let's dump 'will', dump 'might' and go with 'expects'.

So what was the theory that Brown had when he observed Brownian motion for
the first time? Remember you're trying to insist on theory _before_
observation, not after the start of observation.

Nope. You speak after you've observed, or at least, after you've started to
observe.

While you wait, Ian, ...

I hope that you're going to make use of the fruits of fuzzy logic and
not ignore them just because they are not consistent with your logic. :-)

They are already revolutionizing the level of machine intelligence around
us and may well be the starting point for future SIs.  I'd hate to think
that you won't be launching into space because you think that the world
is flat, to make an analogy.  Perhaps a lesson from scientific pragmatism
would be useful here:  everyone has always known that there is no such
thing as electrons being discrete particles or waves, yet we have all
been happy to create our TVs and microwave ovens and space shuttles as

Ahhhhh!  Thank goodness you're being clear at last, Lyle.  [Perhaps you
made the point clearly before I joined this list ...]  Now I understand:
you do not believe in "Extropian MNT".  Fine, that's the end of the
discussion, as I have no intention of trying to convert you to what you
feel is an unfounded religion.

I think that I have made the mistake of assuming that all Extropians
"believe" in MNT and/or of thinking that only Extropians are vocal on this
list, which of course is a silly mistake to make since it's an open list.
I don't know which category you're in, but either way, shucks, sorry.
I was taking too much for granted in this meme space.  You can argue MNT
with others;  as an engineer, I'm more interested in *making* it happen.

There is no attack on the social sciences, Kathryn, at least not from me.
I merely examine the scientific basis of various disciplines, and I am
amply qualified to do that.  I do *not* delve into the social aspects,
except inasmuch as time and again I have been saying that work in these
areas is extremely valuable and *must* be done by these disciplines
because it is outside of the scope of science to do it.

So, where's the alleged attack?  All I see is *support*.  When I call a
"social science" a social study and say it is *not* a science then I'm
merely being precise with language and true to the procedures that underly
the scientific method.  I'm not attacking the work you do, only ensuring
that the label "science" is used correctly.  If you understood science as
well as you do your own field then you would probably agree with me.

Please try and see this thread in the constructive light in which it is
intended.  It does nobody any good for a field of study to be mislabeled.

Rich.

I don't think it would --- we live inside our minds, as they say, and
our minds are good at compartamentalizing experiences.  Furthermore,
remembered "real" experiences are often no more vivid than virtual ones,
while virtual experiences can be especially vivid and as pleasureable as
we wish them to be.

Here's a trivial little example than no doubt many have experienced:
you have a small drink and you turn on the CD player and you play some
of your favourite tracks, and if you got the timing right and all the
other unknowables are in sync then you experience a real high.  You
know that the world hasn't suddenly become a nicer place, and you know
that the same tracks wouldn't give you a high without the drink, and
you know that the one drink wouldn't have any noticeable effect on you
normally, yet you *ENJOY* the high, immensely, despite knowing that it's
not based on anything beyond the bounds of your skull.  The experience
was virtual (in at least one sense of the word) and you knew it, yet
that didn't lessen the experience.

(I know that this doesn't address the *exact* question you asked, Sarah,
but I think it's reasonably related in the sense that it is experienced
without any direct contact with the world outside our senses.)

OK, one example doesn't make much of a statistical population.  Can
folks think of others that either support or deny the premise?

Although there is danger in reasoning from analogy, at first glance your
analogy with the Web looks interesting.  Unfortunately, it seems to fall
apart under a little more examination, as follows.

First of all, the web allows goods to be created at zero cost in the web
information space (you can make your HTML twice as long without additional
cost, usually), so that would appear to be a point of congruence in the
analogy with MNT.  Unfortunately, the new goods created do not provide
for subsistence of their creator, who will still have to pay his or her
ISP and still have to earn a living to pay for food and shelter, so the
analogy doesn't hold there.  After all, MNT is predicted even in the
tamer predictions to create food on demand (just recycled biosphere) and
to manipulate the geology just as effectively, so shelter too is free.
(The Earth has a negligible population density, but it's just too costly
and hard on people at present for a planetary mini-diaspora to occur.)

Secondly, and more importantly, you can create web goods at zero cost,
but you cannot create their means of production, ie. the tools that
create web spaces and networks and computers *cannot* be created by the
web weaver.  Consequently, there is no congruence with MNT here at all.

The latter is the big issue.  When a single person without any special
resources can create what today is a mammoth work of civil engineering
(my favourite example of the seawater pipeline to the nearest ocean)
then all bets are off as to the structure of economic institutions.

It's this business of creating the *means of production* at the point of
need (eg. only the leading edge of the pipeline may contain a "factory")
that I keep on trying to point out as being so crucial, because that is
the key difference with today's manufacturing as far as economics is
concerned.  Merely producing cheaper goods (even *zero-cost* goods) is
really just an evolutionary change, because today's factories would still
be required and people would still have to pay for the privilege of
owning their product.  That equation undergoes a discontinuity when
the means of production themselves can also be nanoconstructed out of
the surrounding biosphere and geology.

> Perhaps it's an economy of abundance, but the marketing types are still
> thinking in terms of an economics of scarcity.

Yes, that's a good point.  I can't figure out why they don't make the
mental switch though, when it's so clear that major changes are in the
making.  I suspect that it's going to take a lot of knocking our heads
against brick walls before it's accepted as "obvious".

> Does it make sense to compare a near-future information-based economy to
> a later-future nanotech economy?

Within limits, possibly.  The analogy doesn't carry over well into the
most important expected area of impact of MNT though.

It's no wonder that this subject is causing so much disunity, when people
are using the same word to mean exactly opposite things.  David, your
paragraph above practically *defines* subjectivity, not objectivity, at
least in the scientific sense of the word.  Ie. your last sentence reads
just fine after turning "ob" into "sub":

    "Our fantasies and imagination are subjective, in the sense
     that they are actually occuring inside our own heads."

Evidently we're not going to get anywhere with this discussion if the
the use of words is not just miles apart but practically reversed.  That
throws all pretense of reasoned argument on its head.  Words are very
important, especially in a textual forum such as this.  Take liberty
with their meaning and you end up with the mess that we have here.

Fun excersize. What's your conclusion? My conclusion, from reading
your/Nick's
work, is that a corporation (running at SI timescales) will NOT
colonize,
unless it wants to "spawn". I don't think a (for profit) corporation can
possibly
gain. Other multiple-human organizations (governments, families,
religious groups)
may wish to "spawn" or to move, but not with the motivation of monetary
profit for
the home system.

You missed my favorite one: the Singularity. If your wish about nanotech
and
brain-computer interfaces comes true, it will precipitate the
singularity.
the Singularity would make a really spectacular millenial event.
My predictions for the time of the singularity hasn't changed: within
the decade starting 1 May 1996. 1 Jan 2001 is about half way into this
period.

Yep, you caught me.  I should have said 'the only *books* I've been 
reading lately are science books'.  I've also been reading this mailing 
list.  I guess I mistakenly assumed this was self-evident.  These 
'reasons for believeing that cover-ups exist' have been getting posted 
here quite regularly, and so of course I am now rather familiar with them.

My discussions with Robin and Lyle were not intended to cover Starships,
or
even pipelines. My point about economic meltdown remains valid if we
consider
only the replacment of production of consumer goods with MNT
manufacture.
Yes, MNT designs for this class of goods are not yet available. (We can
safely
call this an understatement...)  Yes, design of an MNT-produced product
must
include the design of its associated manufacturing process.

NANOSYSTEMS does in fact address the problem of communicating the
process
instructions to the assemblers. Your joke about batons is not far off.
I got my copy of the book at the local Barnes & Noble store, but you can
probably get it at any large bookstore. The book takes an extremely
conservative approach to MNT engineering at the detail level. It's
intended
to present a convincing argument that MNT violates no physical laws and
that
a particular class of structures is feasible. The only part of the
argument
that I didn't find convincing was the thermodynamics chapter. It's
probably
also completely valid, but I'm not competent to judge. The rest of the
physics, reliability theory, statistics, computer science, and chemistry
is deliberately kept simple enough to allow an intelligent layman with
some
background in science to form a valid opinion. This simplicity is
possible
because of extremely conservative assumptions and error bounds. 

IMO, the major problem will be in the design of the products and
systems,
just as Lyle claims. We differ in our respective perceptions of the
degree of
difficulty, and the analogies from which we reach these perspectives. I
feel
that the design process for the class of consumer goods in question will
look a lot like the design of a computer system's hardware and software.
Current computer hardware design is done using CAD tools, and software
design
is done with softwar development tools. These tool suites will evolve
into
tool suites for MNT design. Most exsting "durable goods" can be designed
hierarchically, with the individual pieces designed independently and a
MNT "gluing" strategy used to build the final product. Individual pieces
such as sheet-metal parts can be designed very rapidly from prototype
"library subroutines". Larger subassemblies (pump, motors, etc.) can be
designed using specialized software packages, or an off-the-shelf design
can be used. However, I suspect that most people will simply use
freely-available complete designs for most goods. The designs will be
available because most designers are creative people who enjoy design
and
who like to see their designs used.

Lyle believes that it takes a car company to build a car, and that, by
analogy
it will take the equivalent of the human talents of the employees of
that
company, as they apply to the building of cars, for an MNT "factory" to
build the same car. I concur, but I differ wil Lyle in that I don't
think that
very much of the human activity in a car company actually goes into
building a
car. The vast majority of the activity goes into material acquisition,
accounting,
management, sales and marketing, plant maintanence, and other peripheral
activities. the only piece of the human activity within a car company
that I
think we need but don't have with MNT, is the design, which I discussed
above.

Lyle's other analogy is with a biologist attempting to re-engineer a
tree.
IMO this analogy is inappropriate because a biologist does not have the
level of uderstanding of a tree that we have of MNT. Once we have the
first MNT assembler, we know how to proceed. There is no equivalent for
trees.

I speculate that "intelligence" has many components. Among the more
important
compnents are the knowlwdge base and the speed, as you also speculate.
I'd
add that interactions between the speed and the knowledge are likely to
constitute an important additional component. For purposes of the
feedback,
we can restrict the discussion of inteligence to "technical creative
intelligence." Other types of intellectual acrtivity are important and
valuable, but not relevant to the feedback mechanism.

As it happens, the argumant for a rapid feedback mechanism doesn't
depend
on the whole mechanism of intelligence. It depends on some assumptions
that
are IMO simpler and more obvious:
    1) Speed and knowledge base are important components of
intelligence.
    2) We will be able to increase the both the speed and the knowlege
base
       of existing humans by using computers and new software and
interfaces.
    3) A more intelligent researcher can develop a better understanding
of
       the basis of intelligence, and can therefore increase
intelligence
       further, either through better computer hardware and software or
by
       other means.

The get an initial increase from the first two assumptions, which then
leads to
further increases via the third.

In the discussion between Eugene Leitl and Robin Hanson about social science 
experiments, they bring up the difference between Experimentation and 
Observation.  I think Eugene is correct; observation is _part_ of 
experimentation.  However, I would just like to point out that experimentation 
is simply a way of setting up interesting things to observe.  Science is about 
making sense of our observations.  The experimental aspect is simply to 
intentionally create some phenomena that one is interested in observing, 
rather than waiting around for it to just happen on its own, since in most 
cases it's not likely to happen on its own, and even if it does, you're not 
likely to be there to observe it carefully.  Thus, we can get a large sampling 
of observations which we have set up to be very similar in most respects and 
varied in particular, chosen respects.  Then we have enough observational data 
to reasonably fit our theories to.  If the things we wanted to study 
spontaneously arose and varied themselves in precicely the ways we would if we 
were setting them up as an experiment, then we wouldn't have to experiment at 
all, just observe carefully and theorize.  But alas, the world isn't so 
cooperative, so we must go out of our way to set up and vary interesting 
phenomena to observe.

Just a note to say that there are a few techniques set up to study 
some phenomena on an observational/encoding basis, chiefly ethology, 
which has had many applications in the study of primates and other 
group interactions.

I don't know the computer programming involved, but Franz de Waal 
describes an elaborate code that allows his researchers to transcribe 
the actions of all subjects in a group, which are then entered into a 
computer.  Then programs are run that will reveal patterns of 
interaction or other metapatterns.

It is through the technique of ethology that de Waal revealed the 
varied power structures among primate species.  In _Peacemaking Among 
Primates_, he describes how his researchers gradually uncovered a murder 
plot among a group of chimpanzees that resulted in their leader being 
assassinated one night.

Eric,

Just to clarify what I said:  I never said that our subjective knowledge was 
infalliable.  All I said is that we are certain THAT we are experiencing.  We 
are much less certain WHAT we are experiencing.  We may be horribly wrong 
about the *content* of our experiences, but the very fact that we are 
experiencing something rather than nothing is blatently obvious to each of us. 
 That is what I was saying, and that is ALL I was saying.  I don't think that 
this re-establishes the subjective/objective dichotomy at all.  

But, you're right; if I _was_ claiming that we understand our subjective 
experiences perfectly, while we can never hope to understand the objective 
world perfectly, I _would_have_ been reinstating the objective/subjective 
dichotomy that I was busily demolishing.  But I wasn't saying that, you just 
thought I was.  So, we don't disagree at all on this point.  Just a simple 
misunderstanding.  Now you can write your "me too" post.

I heavily disagree with this.  As we increase the quality of "software" we are 
running in our brains, we become more intelligent.  Our intelligence is not 
some static quality.  It has very much to do with our existing knowledge and 
our ways of thinking about things, and these things can be changed.  Our 
intelligence can increase incredibly as we change our ways of thinking and 
develop more useful knowledge.  The nature of the "hardware" of our brains is 
very important too, but the right "software" can make the difference between a 
bumbling moron and a brilliant genius.  

We all have the ability to increase our intelligence by a tremendous amount by 
constantly developing and refining more powerful thinking skills and 
knowledge.  I have been doing this for the past few years, and I am several 
times more intelligent than I was a few years ago, and my rate of progress 
continues to accellerate.  It is because I am constantly revising and refining 
my observational and thinking skills.  I am rewriting my own software, and I 
am becoming smarter because of it.  It requires a great deal of personal 
discipline, but we can make ourselves more intelligent by altering our ways of 
thinking and our ways of gathering information.

hope that all humans benefit from technological advancement.  However, I don't 
see the selfish and greedy interests of private business as conflicting in any 
way with the general welfare of humanity.  In fact, I see the selfishness and 
greed of the business world as the driving force of technological progress, 
the provider of nearly all the wealth that we enjoy, and I think that selfish 
and greedy business people are the most likely people to actually help the 
poor, even though other people have much more compassion for the poor in 
general.

First of all, a business cannot make money except by selling what people want 
to buy.  So, a selfish, greedy business person, who only cares about making 
lots of money is driven to provide the best products and most appealing 
services in order to make lots of money.  They are in the business of 
satisfying people's desires, and the ones who do it the best make the most 
money.  But there is a great deal of competition in business, and the 
businesses which are more efficient than other businesses can sell products at 
lower cost than their competition while receiving the same amount of profit.  
Thus, they will usually tend to make more money than their competition.  Also, 
those which are more efficient can provide higher quality products at the same 
price as their competition and thus outsell them.  

Greedy, selfish business people are constantly driven to outdo each other in 
providing higher quality, less expensive products and services.  Thus, their 
greed and selfishness itself drives them to help people more than their 
competition, to be better at providing people with what they desire (and 
fulfilling people's desires is the best definition of "helping people" that I 
know of).

But to provide better products and services at lower prices requires making 
progress in technology, improving manufacturing methods and so forth, and this 
is the basic driving force behind nearly all technological progress.  Their 
greed drives them to develop better technologies.  Nearly all the wealth we 
enjoy comes from our technology.  Even the money you are willing to pay in 
taxes to help the poor exists because of the efforts of many greedy, selfish 
business people.  Without all the greedy, selfish business people, we would 
all be very poor indeed.  If people weren't so greedy, they wouldn't compete 
so fiercely and refine the quality of their products so quickly and 
competently.  In fact, I wish people were *greedier* and *more* selfish, in 
general.  If they were, they wouldn't tolerate the government taking away over 
half their income, we would all be making way more money, businesses wouldn't 
have to pay so much in taxes and could afford to lower their prices 
considerably (they would be driven to lower them, through competitive greed).

As far as greedy, selfish business people being the ones who will bring 
prosperity to the poor of the world goes, remember that businesses always seek 
to increase their number of customers.  When the market gets too difficult to 
enter in rich countries, like the United States, then poorer countries will 
look more appealing to the greedy business people.  At first, they will use 
the poor people for cheap labor. And, at this point, the bleeding-hearts in 
America start crying, "Exploitation!"  But we must remember that the poor 
people wouldn't work for these businesses unless they were being paid more 
than they were before.  They're still in a bad position, yes, but less so than 
before, because they're making more money than before, and they're gaining 
skills.  Then, other businesses will want to sell their products to these poor 
people, who can now afford a little more, and now that they have more skills, 
other greedy business people will want to come in and offer them jobs which 
pay a little more than they are getting from their other jobs, so that they 
can attract the best workers.  So, slowly, slowly, through the efforts of 
greedy, selfish business people, the poor are raised from their poverty and 
taught how to work and how to maintain a prosperous community.  Remember the 
early days of the Industrial Revolution?  Remember all the poor people working 
in the factories and all the cries of exploitation?  Well, look at the world 
today.  We are much richer now than ever.  And it is because of all the 
greedy, selfish people that exploit us whenever they can, as mush as they can. 
 But to exploit us, they must provide us with something we want, and then 
their competitors will try to outdo them and offer us something even better, 
and it goes back and forth and all around until eventually everyone is very 
wealthy.  But we must give it time to run its course.  The poor won't become 
wealthy overnight, but they are becoming wealthier than they ever were before. 
 We are making progress, and most of our progress comes directly from the work 
of greedy, selfish business people.

If the governments would just get out of the way and let the greedy, selfish 
people do their good work, the prosperity would be spread around much faster.  
Coercive, meddling governments are slowing down progress and the advancement 
of prosperity considerably, and they are the biggest enemies of poor people 
everywhere.

A lot of the reason people are against greedy, selfish people is because they 
imagine that there is only a limited amount of wealth to go around, so if the 
greedy people take more, there is less left for everyone else.  Considering 
that nearly all the wealth we enjoy now was not around a few million years 
ago, or even a few hundered years ago, this view is patently absurd.  Wealth 
is constantly being created, and most of it is being created by greedy, 
selfish people, and that creation of wealth benefits us all.

Another point to make is that while greed and selfishness are extremely good 
qualities for a business person to have, they are extremely dangerous 
qualities for anyone involved in the government to have.  This is because 
business people _make_ money through voluntary transaction (if they don't do 
it voluntarily, I don't consider them business people, I consider them 
thieves), while the government _gets_ its money by forcefully taking it from 
people.  Thus, greedy politicians will cause even more money to be taken from 
people and cause tyranny to grow while greedy business people will create more 
wealth and cause prosperity and abundance to spread to everyone.

On Saturday, September 28, 1996 6:27AM Dr. Rich Artym said (to Lyle):
"You can argue MNTwith others;  as an engineer, I'm more interested in
*making* it happen."

Then, on Saturday, September 28, 1996 5:01PM Dr. Rich Artym asked:
"I wonder though, is there anyone else on the list besides Lyle that
doesn't believe that MNT will achieve the bulk of the things that are

time and effort in wasted arguments."

I think the majority would agree (or at least like to believe) that
strong nanotech capabilities will _eventually_ be achieved.  But I can
recall at least two others besides myself who posted concerns about your
vision of how we can get there from here and what shape it might
ultimately take.

As an engineer, and a software one at that, I would think you'd
recognize the need for calibration and specification that Lyle suggests,
as well as the practicality of incremental development.  Too many
'grand-scheme' or 'master-plan' software development efforts have
crashed & burned.  *In the case of nanotech, the consequences could be
alot more severe than just some money down the drain.*

IMHO, the scenarios you've suggested would be feasible only for some
stripped-down, 'virtual nanotechnology' simulated in an Artificial
Reality, OR in a world where nanites were already in control of
everything - "an organic/silico blob" / "a teaming, feasting soup" as
some posts on older threads envisioned.  That day may come; but, if
you're really "more interested in *making* it happen", you should be
working on a practical transition plan.

 I can't see any signs of a sudden change in feedback mechanisms.
It's silly to expect the first assemblers to be easily programmed general
purpose devices, for the same reason that it would have been silly to
expect the first computer to run Smalltalk. There will be a number of
constraints imposed on designs by the limits on what is chemically
stable, and it will take a lot of trial and error before we know how
to handle those limits well.

 What will keep AI salaries noticeably greater than zero? The supply

 Very complex? Most of the nanotech designs I've heard people talking
about can be fully specified (at atomic level precision) in minutes
worth of communication. That will obviously change as the designs grow
more powerfull, but my guess is that nanotech devices will often be
much simpler than corresponding low-tech devices. I agree with the
rest of your conclusions here, but doubt that complexity explains them.

 This assumes the employers would get much of the benefits. There

 Can a higher premium be usefully placed on IQ? My impression is that
the most successfull employers value IQ or something equivalent above
all other features in their hiring decisions. It isn't clear that
higher incomes will attract more high IQ people - those that are
influenced significantly by money in their choice of jobs usually
can get equity with a high expected value.

 Raw intelligence does affect the speed and quality with which the

I've expressed skepticism in response to the messianic MNT fervor
expressed by some, including you, I thought on both lists, some time
ago.  "Drextech."  Certainly doubt as to whether useful general
assemblers will be achieved 'soon'.  I don't have any strong arguments
to drag out, just a concern as to whether the engineering problems might
turn out to be much more difficult than expected.

Lyle, demonstrating isomorphism takes more than just saying you see it.
I see no real isomorphism between your analogies and MNT, so the premise
seems completely wrong to me and therefore so do your conclusions.  It's
even worse than that actually, because you first make a point of choosing
living animates to make your analogy and then somehow make the unjustified
leap that your choice can be used to *infer* similar capabilities in nano.
It was *YOUR CHOICE*, it didn't fall out from some independent line of
reasoning, so the properties of that choice certainly can't be used to
indicate the properties of something that is quite unrelated.

	Who says that our fantasies and imagination are happening
	inside our heads?  They could be happening inside the big
	toe of the guy down the street, for all that it matters.

     Objective:  Being the object of perception or thought;
	belonging to the object of thought rather than the 
	thinking subject.

     Subjective:  Existing in the mind; belonging to the 
	thinking subject rather than to the object of thought.

	-Both- are happening as a result of the mind*.  It is
	only when two or more people get together that the
	distinction between objective/perception and 
	subjective/creation become important.  Otherwise 
	fantasies and realities	might as well be the same.

	*	Please note that I did not use the term inside,
	which is where I believe that most of the confusion is
	coming from.  To say that a seemingly intangable thing
	'is somewhere' leads to misconceptions, and strange loops
	of logic.  I am not sure if a thought is an electron
	crusing around a neuron, or if it is something completely
	untangable.  Also, electrons only seem to exist, I do not
	claim to know for sure if they do or do not exist.

IAN: I am familiar with fuzzy logic. Working on holistic logic 
and realizing that things are never all A or all ~A, I mapped 
out a bivalent truth scale and it then occurred to me that I 
think this may be what they call "fuzzy logic."  I ran out 
and got Kosko's book I realized that, "Crap, someone else 
already figured this out. D'oh!  There goes that nobel 
prize." ;^) Of course as it turns out bivalent logics
were around decades ago, but Kosko has been blazing 
many new exciting trails.

The reason holistic and multivalent logic overlap to some 
degree is that they both allow for the condition in which 
A = ~A. That's how I realized the bivalent logic table had 
to be scraped, thus a multivalent scale followed logically.

Holistic logic and multivalent logic are different yet harmonious.

What I see is that even as X is 60% A and 40% ~A, it is ALSO 
always 50/50, for 60% implies 40% and vice versa. 60% implies 
60% to a degree EQUAL to the degree that it implies 40%. Hot 
implies hot to a degree equal to the degree that it implies 
not-hot. The mutual dependence of A and ~A, is their constant 
equality; therefore, multivalent logic is not inconsistent
with holistic logic or vice versa. 

Holistic logic is a principle of relational identity, while 
multivalent is a high resolution classification. So multivalent 
logic is an improved system of classifications, an improved way 
of describing categories of things, but it's still just language, 
still just human impositions on nature that fit the variant texture 
of nature far more effectively than bivalent. Holistic logic on the 
other hand tells us how things actually  are, not that fuzzy does 
not also do this. Obviously fuzzy logic can be demonstrated to be 
more utilitarian than I can now demonstrate holistic logic to be. 
But the two are connected: fuzzy logic is "soft-Zen," while holistic 
logic is "hard-core Zen" in which A always = ~A. Holistic logic 
does not deny fuzzy logic, while Aristotelian logic does deny fuzzy.

	Truth is relative and it is decided by a popularity contests.
	If people didn't embrace the idea that the Earth revolved around
	the Sun, then it would not become true.  Truth can also be forced
	upon an individual: "you must believe that this is true otherwise
	we are going to lock you away in a padded room."

	Is truth a result of an experiment?  Which a year or so from now
	becomes false because 'we' discovered something else which seems
	more true.

	Actual truth is unknown and will ALWAYS be unknown.  Without relitive
	truth 'we' have nothing.

	Are you claiming to know actual truth?  Hmm...

	Truth would be relative in such cases.
	Two seemingly contradictory events occuring at the exact same time,

I`m not sure if that`s the case, although I certainly hope so. For 
example, take raw mathematical skills. While mine are fairly good, I 
don`t have a hope of having the same insights into problems as , say 
Richard Feynman did. I could practice day and night, and while I would 
certainly become better, my hardware just isn`t as good as his was. >

Really. Could give me some of the techniques you have been using. I would certainly appreciate any methods of 
making myself more intelligent.
How do you alter your ways of taking in information? More diverse media?
How do you improve your observational and thinking skills. I just wrote a 
programming competition today, and I watched as I was stumped on one 
problem, a couple of people were burning up the score rankings. What

Umm, wrong. A business is driven to make profits, not make the best 
product. They will cut the corners and do everything in their power to 
keep production costs low as long as it doesn`t undermine consumer interest. 
The fact that products like the electric toothbrush, disposable diapers,  are 
demanded by the public scares me. You`ll notice that the public is only a 
small minority of people, yet entire societies and ecosystems are 
consumed in our mad rush for more junk.

efficiency, smefficiency. Having slave labour is very efficient, but it 
doesn`t help the workers any. While I don`t like union structures, they 
are necessary if corporations are going to be this evil. What ever

Assuming consumers are enlightened enough to know. This is where that 
tool of oppression known as mass media comes in.Advertisers can direct 
the news by controlling what shows they sponsor. Of course, they can 
dictate what the public thinks if they onw the means of communication. 
For example, GE owning NBC. Do you think anyone on NBC news will say 
anything against SDI, which benefits GE in a major way.

We are making progress, definitely, but HUMANITY is not making progress. 
Ethnic strife brought on by excruciating poverty and famine is ransacking 
much of the world. The western nations are a safe haven from the problems 
of the world. The biggest problem Canada has, according to the news, is 
constitutional matters. These seem to pale in comparison to the plight of 
people in Nigeria, where Shell is busy assisting in the extermination of 
an ecosystem and the suppression of human rights.

Governments are villainous, I agree, but not as much as big business. Big 
business has government so firmly in it`s pocket it dictates when we have

Depends on definition of wealth. In our still very industrial age, oil 
and other finite reserves imply wealth. Until we expand out into space 
and begin harvesting resources from there, we will have a limited amount 
of wealth. Especially now that we are so close to the brink.>

Voluntary transaction being you can either work for the bare minimums 
and the possiblilty of death on the job or starve. Everybody has choices, 
just some people have choices which suck more.

MmMM, food for thought there. Government, in theory, is accountable to 
the people, corporations don`t even have the theory. If they can suppress 
a minority in order to gain the consumer support of a majority, they win.

OK, this is a reasonable response.  Since you accept that MNT will

The reason why I am a front-line optimist on the MNT rate-of-change front
(but have large concerns about whether we'll survive, which follows from
the rate-of-change argument) is that, unlike the state of the world when
the transistor was developed, today we have engineering and computing
facilities that will collapse the time required to a fraction of the 50
years it took us to develop million-transistor integrated circuits.

So many technologies are converging to deliver the required engineering
capability that it's hard to keep up.  Every time we look around there's
been yet another DNA sequenced or protein created, semiconductor plants
are driving back the barriers of the smallest features they can create
mercilessly, fuzzy neural companies are increasing the cleverness of
their gizmos all the time, and every man, woman and their dog now has a
top engineering workstation on their desk with the capability to create
any design they wish.  So many thousands of software teams are delivering
full working packages to the public domain weekly as seen in the many
systems/languages announce newsgroups that the capability of the man in
the street is undergoing an explosive increase that exceeds even that
of many a corporate researcher bound by company standards.  We're well
onto the lower slopes of that good ol' Singularity.

That simply cannot fail to have an impact on the rate of progress of
MNT development, it seems to me.  Many different approaches are being
taken by MNT researchers so it's not a case of all the eggs being in
one basket, and the software design systems can adapt to whichever
hardware route proves viable.  Furthermore, as many people have said,
whichever hardware route succeeds in delivering an elementary building
block, from that point on we can start to bootstrap ourselves out of
the (probably soft) embryonic technology into other forms.  Of course
there are numerous unknowns in this area, everyone accepts that, but
the incredible synergy around right now at such an early stage makes
me think that MNT will happen sooner rather than later.  As others
have said, why *should* it take 50 years, what are people going to
do the other 30? :-)

Much of the time estimate relies on "feeling" based on seeing what's
happening around us, aided with a sense of what engineering research
is about.  Fair enough, "feeling" differs between people, so others
may be working to different estimates, I accept that.  Given the 20-
year figure though (and that's not just mine, I'm merely agreeing with
the Drexlerian 10-15-20 year scenario), that represents the blink of
an eyelid in social and economic terms, which is why I insist that the
development of MNT harbours not an evolution of social and economic
systems but a cataclysmic revolution.

Mankind is capable of accepting anything (I believe) as evolutionary
given time, but I do not think that he's going to have the time to
make a smooth transition.  If we're talking about 20 years then there
is no chance at all of evolution in economics --- shucks, most board
members in the corporate world haven't yet come to terms with the
Internet and those nerdy computer things, and they *don't* read SF. (:-)

The status quo is so strongly rooted in a historical legacy of slowly
changing systems with the institutions of the status quo in control
that there is no prospect of it changing gracefully to meet MNT as
a challange.  Instead, I expect MNT to arise out of a combination of
small engineering concerns, academic research departments, privateers
and the massed ranks of the public domain, and then to suddenly and
very dramatically explode on an unprepared world.  My *hope* is that
it *MERELY* causes the entire economic system to collapse for financial
reasons;  my fear is that it will be far worse than that, and that even
if the biosphere doesn't get converted into goo, many inimical forms
will nevertheless be released, and we may not survive it.

[By the way, the reasons for the mentioned "collapse" I have already
explained several times, so I won't repeat them here.  No economics
detractor that *does* accept MNT (Lyle doesn't) has yet come back with
any argument at all explaining how current-day economics can survive
without a dependent customer base to feed money through the system;
the message about means of production appears not to have got through.]

It's the practical transition plans that are doomed to failure:  this
MNT stuff has no prospect of being developed in a controlled manner,
as it's kitchen-table technology in principle.  Just because we may not
like "a teaming, feasting soup" doesn't mean that we won't get one.

I don't get the "virtual nanotech" reference.  The elements needed for
MNT to develop along well-explained paths are being created now, today,
in the real world.  Anyone that says it's only possible in virtual
settings have their heads rammed deep, deep into the sand.

Peter, you're missing Dan's argument entirely!  The ability of MNT to
beget MNT is a completely cataclysmic change in feedback mechanisms:
as you say, many a constructed molecule will not be stable, but MNT
provides a near-instantaneous means of finding out, empirically.  The
early systems will be iterating through zillions of possible molecular
arrangements in search of stable configurations.  Furthermore, far from
not being programmable, the first generation of assemblers is expected
to feature totally dumb, non-programmable actuators that are totally
controlled by external computers and hence have all the programmability
of those.  In practice then, they'll be massively programmable right
from the start, and the only substantial limitation this will impose
is that control lines will have to be extended back to the point of
control as systems are constructed --- not a big problem for stage 1.

In any event, the programmability "problem" is a non-problem;  work
is well in hand on rod logic, and we're dab hands at creating CPUs.

So, both of your reasons why the development of MNT will be delayed
are, I think, in error.  I agree with Dan's reasoning.

Rich.

Well, I call myself lots of things, and none of them are intended to make
people stop picking on me (in fact, I suspect some of them encourage it). I
do think this is an inappropriate forum for claims against the person,
rather than against the views or arguments of that person, but if you wanna
go for it, go for it!

(Not a great fan of chivalry myself, although I have been known to hold
doors open for attractive women, I suppose.)

I can see how it my come across as such. Oops, my mistake.

However, in the light of Robin Hanson's corroborative post I must say it
seems I was wrong. In some ways I think that's a shame: if people disagree
with me I'd like to know. For instance, Robin and I had a short discussion
some time ago which showed me flaws in my thinking and allowed me to revise
my ideas on gender very productively. I'd hate to think I might have missed
that chance.

Your formation of this opinion started from the premise that I thought

So that ain't my worldview. Promise.

Similar thing to last time: you're confusing a judgement call _about_
toleration with a judgement call which _is_ toleration.

I disagree that toleration means judging a person's actions to be
unimportant. For instance, suppose I had a partner who spent a lot of time
away, which made me unhappy, but she was away because she was helping with
human rights issues somewhere. I might tolerate her absence precisely
_because_ I considered her actions so incredibly important, and _above_ me.

I wouldn't hold your breath in this case :-) I'm not about to try and
rationalize my system of morality and ethics at this point, which is what
such a discussion would amount to.

I prefer to use both systems as appropriate. Doesn't alter the fact, you
were confusing the feelings which _are_ tolerance and intolerance with
feelings _about_ tolerance and intolerance.

>SM: <An individual's feelings include tolerance and intolerance...>
>
>Tolerance is not a "feeling," but a virtue.

That's a very healthy attitude.

How did you guess? :-)

Again, all I'm saying is that I don't place a value judgement on tolerance
itself. I would not say 'tolerance' is good, and therefore tolerate all
things. My value judgements decide what I tolerate and what I do not tolerate.

No: I think my reply was badly worded. I'd rather not be destroyed _and_
honour diversity. Mind you, sometimes that's a difficult fight!

But the actions precipitated in those who listen by those who talk are the

Robert Brown observed Brownian motion and couldn't explain it: but I'm sure
he had his own pet theory. It took Einstein to come up with the answer (if
my science books are correct, and I have no reason to doubt them).

But your argument was that "Observation, meaning no predictions are
involved, still must have some theory behind it, or else what is to be
recorded as having been observed?" When Brown first observed pollen motion
there was no theory at all behind it. Afterwards there may have been some
incorrect theory behind it. But supposing Brown had just recorded his
observations, without any supporting theory (which, for all I know, he may
have done). That wouldn't have stopped Einstein coming up with the theory
and, after verification, explanation for the phenomenon. You don't need a
theory to observe, and you don't need a theory to record your observations.

You've stumbled across my little encoded message about gender and 
power dynamics.  The subject is much upon my mind as I will be 
teaching a class tomorrow on the violence that is visited upon 
persons who do not conform to societal gender roles.

Metaphors rely on universal understanding, and when it comes to 
relations between genders, our set of images is mighty limited.  
The point here is that I could see no way to reverse the genders and 
compe up with an equally cogent metaphor, because the locii of power 
get reversed.

Cutting costs is a valid component in creating better products.  In fact,
it's the component that makes those products available to the "masses."

I suppose people do buy a lot of "junk."  That's their right; the Earth is
not nearly as fragile as most environmentalists presume.

Here's what I consider truly sinister: government bureaucrats (or
gov't-appointed committees of "experts") deciding which products should be
produced and which should not.

Although the profit motive is not based on any specific morality, gov't
regulation is: the morality of arrogance and corruption.  It is no surprise
to some of that the Soviet Union and other socialist nations have been the
biggest creators of pollution and "junk" products.

Businesses can be voted out of existence by consumers.  Most career
government bureaucrats have jobs for life.

This recent trend is nice, and gives us more breathing space, but I
don't think we should pin too many hopes on it.  There are
subpopulations of rich countries with large birth rates, and over the
long term they should come to dominate.  You might pin more hopes on 
the idea the soon our economic growth rate may exceed any feasible
population growth rate, given the familiar technology of having
babies.  But with uploads, this limit should go away.

Subject: Virtual Experiences
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Sarah's wondering if she had an experience in virtual reality that was 
indistinguishable from an experience in "reality", would it lessen the effect?

First off, all we have are experiences.  We have our sensory experiences, our 
thought experiences and our emotional experiences, and so forth.  Virtual 
reality (in its very advanced form) would be able to provide us with 
incredibly detailed sensory experience, with so much detail and realism that 
we would have no way to distinguish the experience from reality, since our 
realities are made entirely of our experiences (now, I'm not saying there's no 
objective world, I'm simply saying that each of our personal realities, that 
which we realize, is entirely made of experiences).  Now, the virtual reality 
that people usually talk about only provides sensory experience, so if you 
were thinking, "this isn't real; it's only virtual reality," THAT THINKING 
might lessen the experience for you, but if you jumped right in, which you 
probably would, since we're so accustomed to just accepting our sensory 
experiences as the real world anyway, it would seem entirely real.  But you 
COULD lessen the impact it had on you by constantly reminding yourself that it 
was "only" virtual reality.  So, for example, you could have a sexual 
experience with someone in very advanced virtual reality, and if you didn't 
keep reminding yourself that it was virtual reality it would seem just as real 
and wonderful as it would in real life.  In fact, you wouldn't be able to tell 
the difference.

But perhaps one day, we will be able to provide ourselves with much more than 
sensory information.  Perhaps we will be able to provide ourselves with 
memories and belief systems and emotional responses, so that we could 
experience ourselves as being some other person, like a historical figure, or 
we could see what it's like to live in a certain time period and a certain 
lifestyle.  We could be totally immersed in that reality, and we would have no 
awareness that we were not who we believed ourselves to be.  In fact, most of 
the time, our simulated belief systems wouldn't even think to question that 
they are not really who they think they are, we'd just go on living in the 
simulation and having our experiences.

Some people may even want to experience what its like to be an Extropian in 
1996.  They would see this very message on their computer screen as they were 
reading the Extropian e-mail, like they do every day.  They would totally 
believe that they were really living in 1996, thinking about these Extropian 
ideas, working on creating a better future.  Seeing this particular message 
might make them wonder if, just perhaps, all they're experiencing, including 
all their belief systems and their ways of thinking, their memories, 
everything, is only a simulation.  And perhaps this message was inserted into 
their reality by the system manager to help remind them that it's time to wake 
up now, that it's time to come out of the simulation.  But of course, they'll 
dismiss the idea as being interesting, yes, but most likely not true, just 
like you're doing right now.  In fact, their belief system would probably be 
very similar to yours; they might even think they really are you.  And no 
matter how much anyone tried to convice them that their entire reality was 
simulated, they would think the entire notion just as ridiculous as you would 
right now if I told you that your reality is a computer simulation.  They 
would think, yeah right, David Musick's just trying to fuck with my mind.  But 
they would have no way to be sure.  All their memories and belief structures 
and experiences are provided to them by the computer.  Everything you have 
available to use as a tool to explore your reality further, to see whether it 
really is a computer simulation or not, is provided to you by the computer.

If virtual reality can provide you with a total experience that seems as real 
to you in every way that your present reality does, then I think you can 
imagine its power.  Perhaps you are experiencing it already.  Perhaps you are 
really a transhuman space colonist, studying history, by experiencing what 
it's like to live as various people.  And perhaps now you are experiencing 
what it's like to be the person who is reading this message right now.

The quality of a mailing list is a fragile thing.  If just takes a few
"bad apples" willing to post enough junk, and then people will stop
bothering to post a reply to every post they think is below par.  And
it goes down from there.

I think the net is in great need of some innovate alternatives to the
stark alternatives of open vs. moderated lists.  One idea I've played
with is a list pair, one open and one closed (to posting, but readable
by all).  To apply for membership in the closed list, you submit five
of your recent posts to the open list, which are forwarded to three
random closed list members for consideration.

The personal filter concept that this list used to have doesn't work I
think.  It is important to have a common sense of what some community
is seeing.

Is sex a form of parallel communication?  Chris Hind wants to know.

Well, that depends.  But if you have the genitals sliding down there, the 
tounges playing across each other up here, hands carressing the back, moving 
through the hair on the head,  bodies gliding against each other, engaged in 
an ecstatic dance, each moving and responding the the actions of the other, I 
would call it parallel communication, since there is so much being 
communicated simultaneously.

If you made one copy of yourself, would the copy work for free?  If you 
were a copy, would you work for free?  What will keep AI salaries 
greater than zero is the fact that they will be (by hypothesis) our equals, 
and they will demand the same things we demand.  

If you could make a million copies of yourself, how would that differ 
from our present situation?  The human race already makes a copy of 
itself, every generation.  Millions of new humans enter the work force 
every year.  The supply of entry-level workers is, for most purposes, 
nearly unlimited.  Why don't they work for free?   Why do they demand 
more compensation, as they move into jobs with more responsiblity?

As hard as it is now.  You would still have to (1) conceive the project, 
(2) write a detailed business plan, (3) raise capital, (4) hire the copies, 
specify their jobs, train them, organize them into an efficient work 
force...    Everything you have to do now to create an Exxon 
would still have to be done if you were dealing with copies of yourself.  
In other words, the situations are isomorphic.

I think I've been sloppy in my posts on this topic (especially the post that
Peter McCluskey responded to), so let me try to do better.

The three obvious contributors to the intelligence of the world economy are
population size, the raw speed of human brains, and knowledge (both tacit and
explicit).  While there are other constributors, such as some high level
organizational issues, I doubt they are that important, and expect progress
on improving them to be slow.

Knowledge and population have been increasing for some time.  As the world
economy grows, the more we know, the better we get at learning more, and the
larger population we can support.  And being richer, we've been able to spend
more on research, and on tools to aide research.  (Tools are really
artificats that embody knowledge, in my view.)

Computers are just one of those tools, and haven't really aided research much
more than other important tools, like cars and air conditioning.  Progress in
computers is driven by the size of the market for computers - the more
computers folks buy, the more researchers are employed, and so the more ideas
get tried out.  

Thus we have had a feedback process of growth of knowledge (and tools) and
population for some time.  The big change I see looming here is that of
decreases in the cost, and increases in speed, of individual brains with
uploads.  And especially the ability to make copies, which decreases the cost
of filling new brains with knowledge (the big limit on our growth rate now).
Since this should drive down the cost of labor, research gets cheaper, and so
more should be done.

As our technology of uploads improves, for the same price we can either make
faster brains or more brains.  It is not obvious which option will be more
preferred - the most important thing isn't brain speed but brain cost per
speed.  In particular, research may get done by a few very fast very
expensive brains, but I'd guess lots of slower brains to be the usual case.

Anyway, I basically agree that a change we can envision will increase the
growth rate, but I think folks are confused about the root cause.  The basic
issue isn't brain speed, nor cost per speed.  Human brains are actually
pretty cheap out there at the moment.  The big change is lowering the cost of
creating knowledge-filled brains, with upload copies.

If average brain speed goes up as the growth rate, the subjective effect to
the participants may not be that different from today.

(Is all this any clearer Peter?)

I think we can refine this a bit. When it becomes clear that a
discussion is proceeding from differing sets of premises, either
party to the discussion, or any interested bystander, should point
this out. Then, each party can briefly state their premises. We can
then either move to a discussion of the premises, or we can agree
to disagree. This will save a lot of wasted bandwidth. Robin and
I ended up touching on a lot of fun subjects on these threads
before I understood the need to do this.

It's true that the very first assembler will not be very capable.
However it differs from the very first computer in one essential
way: the first computer was not useful in the fabrication of the
second computer. This is the "sudden change." The trial and error
to which you refer can therefore be accompished much quicker.

Dan Clemmensen says,  

> An individual will be able to produce essentially everything needed 
> for a lavish lifestyle, with none of the costs associated with trade. 

In other words, Extropian Nanotech, or MNT, as defined here, 
means a Cornucopia of self-contained genie machines, in which the 
entire economy is mapped onto a small system that can be owned, 
maintained, and operated by an individual, and each individual has one.   
In this scenario, there is no trade.  

The question to ask is:  why is there trade now?  

Suppose you have an economy in which all individuals have genie 
machines.  They all try to be self-sufficient, to the extent that their 
genie machines allow this.  So our starting point is an economy 
similar to early feudalism, when it first emerged from the ruins of the 
Roman Empire.  Each local Baron had his own farm, his own orchard, 
his own cattle.  He and his village made their own clothes, their own 
horseshoes, their own houses, everything they needed.  They even made 
their own tools.   A Baronial estate was a very coarse-grained version of 
a genie machine.  It could produce anything, if "anything" is construed 
in a generic sense:  some kind of food (not necessarily very good), 
some kind of clothes (not necessarily very good), and so forth.   
Our MNT scenario is a high-tech version of this, in which each individual 
has a very fine-grained genie machine based on nanotechnology, 
which can produce anything the world economy can produce.  

The Gradient Theorem.  
I think it is a theorem in economics that if the genie machines are finite, 
then the MNT scenario is not stable.  Any approximation to it is unstable.  
In fact, there is a gradient away from self-sufficiency, in the direction of 
more trade.  

By "finite" I mean:
     1. The genie machines use energy (they are not perpetual motion 
machines). 
      2. The genie machines perform their tasks at some measurable rate  
(not instantaneously), and different tasks take different times. 
      3.  The cost of retooling or reprogramming a machine is nonzero, 
and the cost varies depending on what kind of retooling is done.  
      4. The genie machines have an interface that requires some 
expertise and effort on the part of the user -- genie machines have to be 
programmed, rather than merely commanded.  (Or if they can be 
commanded, the commands have to be so detailed that it is a lot of 
trouble to give them properly, so "commanding" amounts to the same 
thing as "programming.")  Different tasks requite different degrees of 
expertise and effort.  

If the output of a genie machine depends to some extent on the effort 
put into it by its user/programmer, then all genie machines will not be 
equal, any more than all humans are equal (or all Baronial estates).  
Each of us will have his/her own unique genie machine, just like we all 
have a computer, we all have a set of tools of some kind, we all have a 
personal library, and so forth.  No two are exactly alike.  We not only 
have different hardware, we also have different skills.  There will 
always be differences in the effectiveness of different individuals at 
performing different tasks, even when they are using genie machines.  
People will be power users of some features of their genie machine, and 
never get around to reading the user's manual for many other features.  

Therefore trade will exist, for the same reason it exists now.  

The existence of trade means that the various genie machines and their 
operators will be in communication with each other, offering various 
services.  This will lead to more specialization, not less.  Individuals 
will tailor their genie machines and their skills to the market.  They will 
find that it is in their economic interest to specialize, rather than try to 
do everything.  Self-sufficient Baronial estates will give way to an 
economy based on trade. 

Finiteness Assumption #4 is crucial here.  If this assumption is false -- i.e. 
if the genie machine requires no effort or skill -- then we will all be 
power users of all the functions of our genie machines, and there will be 
no need for trade.  

Finiteness Assumption #4 is certainly true for computers as they 
presently exist.  My computer is a genie machine, in the sense that it 
can produce any software I ask it to produce.  I could "ask" it to make 
me a word processor, if I wanted to.  But "asking" is a rather tedious 
process.  I would have to write the program, compile it, test it, debug it, 
install it... It would require a lot of effort that could be better employed 
elsewhere.  I would rather buy a word processor from someone who is 
devoting a lot of resources to the task.  I would rather spend my time 
doing what I am good at, and let other people do what they are good at.  

That's why there is trade now:  every task requires some nonzero effort, 
and different tasks requires different degrees of effort (and different 
amounts of time).  This leads to specialization and trade.  

In the MNT scenario, asking the genie machine for a word processor is 
not tedious at all.  Making a word processor requires no more effort 
than anything else.  All I have to do is describe it, and presto, it's here.  

If it requires *any* more effort than that -- in other words, if there is 
any significant difference between the effort required to produce 
different items -- then the situation is unstable.  The inequality of effort 
will create a gradient leading away from self-sufficiency, toward an 
economy with trade and ever-increasing specialization.

When I read "Engines of Creation," I ended up with the same feeling you
have. I therefore bought "Nanosystems" and read it (reasonably)
carefully.
I feel that I have enough technical background to evaluate Drexler's
arguments in "Nanosystems", except for the thermodynamics. I found the
arguments convincing. I consider the proposition 
  A) "a MNT factory can build another MNT factory"
to be proven in theory. I consider the proposition 
  B) "given a MNT assembler, we can build a MNT factory"
to be proven in theory. I consider the proposition
  C) "We know  how to build the first MNT assembler without using MNT"
to be unproven. However, I appears to me to be likely. It's therefore an
assumption in my line of reasoning.

My discussions with Robin lead to explicit statement of the following
additional proposition:
   D) "we will develop capable MNT design software."
This is not proven, so you may treat it as a premise. I'll call it a
professional judgement.

Now, My various random posts may not constitute a formal proof, but
I feel that C and D lead to A and B. I also feel that A, B, and D lead
to rapid feedback, economic meltdown, and the Singularity.

I was in Best Buy yesterday and I just happened to glance over and see a
huge TV showing off the new Nintendo Ultra64 running Mario64. The system
itself costs $200 without any games and Mario64 is $70. There are only two
games for it currently but I can tell instantly by looking at Mario64 that
it's a definite winner. Kicks the shit outta Playstation. I am REALLY
impressed by the graphics it displays. It uses a silicon graphics chip to do
spectacular 3D rendering in realtime. They were able to convert a 2D game
like Mario into 3D and did a spectacular job with it. Just looking at
Mario64 I get to thinking how in the next 5 years we may have powerful VR at
our fingertips and able to chat with high-res avatars over the net like the
way the metaverse is described in Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash.

Sender: postmaster@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

It seems that Dan Clemmensen, Rich Artym, and John Clark, are making
the same argument here.  Let me summarize their "NanoDream", as I
understand it:

At some point there will be a device which 
-- can disassemble generic stuff in the environment into feedstock,
-- scan any (house-or-smaller-sized) object for its atomic-level design,
-- sythesize a plan for constructing such an object from feedstock,
-- retool itself and construct the object with a low error rate, and
-- repair itself, or break slowly enough to replace itself anew often.

If such a device were smaller than a house, and could replace itself
in less than a year using stuff available from an acre of land, and if
copyright on the design were not strictly enforced, but if property
rights to such acres of land were strictly and cheaply enforced, then
it would seem that within a hundred self-copy times, most everyone who
owned an acre of land should have such a device, obtained at the cost
of a small fraction of their acre.  And it seems they could then, if
they chose, soon have an acre full of devices for which the design
copyright was not strictly enforced.  And they might so choose if
public designs were not much worse than private designs, and if local
production were near as efficient as distant specialized production.

Given all this, some folks seem to want to infer that at some point
most living humans will fit the scenario of living off their own small
plot of land, using basically free designs.

If I've understood this right, I can challenge the conclusion by
pointing to all the assumptions that may not hold.  I do no have much
doubt that eventually such a device will be possible to construct.
However, by that time many other changes may happen as well.  The sun
may dim due to intervening solar collectors, or the O2 and CO2 may be
stripped from the atmosphere.  An upload or other population explosion
may mean that the ratio of population to acres is far less than one.
Or wealth may be very unequally distributed, so few can afford an
acre.

Copyright on these many devices may in fact be strictly enforced, by a
combination of self-destruction upon scan attempts and draconian
punishments for violators.  Public domain designs of most sorts may be
quite inferior to private designs, or generic one-size-fits-all
devices may be rather inferior in efficiency to specialized devices,
even given shipping costs.  Property rights to acres of land may not
be cheaply enforced, but require payment of substantial taxes or PPL
fees.  To pay such fees, one may have to devote a substantial fraction
of ones resources to production at an advanced level - public domain
defense system designs may be nowhere near up to the task.  Finally,
most people may prefer more to live be closer to other people, in
dense cities, than to have their own isolated plot of gadgets.

Now folks may have plausible arguments for each of these issues.
And I'd like to hear them.  But what are the chances that *all* of
these issues go the way of this NanoDream?

Robin, could you please explain your concept of "upload"? Mine is
perhaps a bit vague. I've always thought of an "upload" as the digital
continuation of a "meat" personality. With this definition, I don't
see how uploads are produced more rapidly than "meat" humans. I also
think of an upload as using less physical resources than a "meat" human,
not more.

Now, if you want to talk about machine-based intelligence in general, I
don't see a real difference in resource use between a society of
replicating
uploads and any other machine-based intelligence.I've always assumed
that
any machine-based intelligence, however internally constituted, could
expand nearly instantly to occupy the entiore available computer
resource, and
could shortly thereafter convert the rest of the available mass into
additional computer resource.

Ecology is not at all the image that I got: It sounds more like a

Paul Di Filippo's 1995 story, "Distributed Mind" (first published in
Interzone but also included in Di Filippo's excellent "Ribofunk"
anthology), describes an intelligent, but benevolant 'grey goo' that
takes over the Earth.

I can't resist giving a flavor for Di Filippo's marvellous new
vocabulary (for those who don't read fiction anymore ;)

>Greenlaw was one of the few members of his cohort gestated and birthed
the old-fashioned baseline way.  neither Incyte Yoot Chutes nor splice
hostmothers ... at an extreme disadvantage, compared to his already
wetwired, chomskied peers.... To escape the lite-servo class he had
been born into and finance further trope doses that he hoped would lead
to a good job in the symbol-analysis class, he was forced to rent out
his personal wetware ... in an online pool ... leading to a brief
flirtation with the Plus-Fourierists ...

Wild mocklife had devored Greenlaw's native bioregion ... His proxies
and splices ... his semisentient splinters and shards and snippets which
had been unable to scatter themselves safely elsewhere across the
telecosm ... Gone, all gone. yet still mockingly there ... simulacra
transfigured by the mass of rogue silicrobes as the Urblastema or ...
the Panplasmodaemonium.<

There's more, though it is a short story.  Di Filippo ends up raising
many of the same questions that Hans Moravec does in a recent essay
about pattern identity (that you can find a link to from Ander's
Transhuman page).  Basically it's the same message that Moravec had in
_Mind Children_:

>Pattern identity ... defines the essence of a person ... as the pattern
and the process going on in my head and body, not the machinery
supporting that process.  If the process is preserved, I am preserved.
The rest is mere jelly.<

I like the pattern identity meme, but I'm not quite ready to dismiss the
physical world as "mere jelly."

In this essay, Moravec goes on to add:

>if the subjective feeling of a person are part of the person-message,
and the evolution of the message is implicit in the message itself,
then aren't the future experiences of the person implicit in the
message? And wouldn't this mathematical existence feel the same to the
person encoded as being simulated in a more substantial way?  I don't
think this is mere sophistry, but I'm not prepared to take it any
further for now.<

Hummm... If that "huge blob of silico/organic _living_ matter", that
"teeming, feasting soup" is really a giant computer capable of
supporting billions of 'virtual machines', is it really a monoculture or
an ecology of minds?

On Wednesday, September 25, 1996 3:46AM, Alexander Chislenko wrote:
"So consciousness evolved with, and *for*, exchange of experiences and
ideas in social interaction.  To share some information on personal
experiences, and derived conclusions, one needs to generalize it beyond
just personal experience, and express it in some transportable and
common representation."

In the same chapter of Dennett's _Consciousness Explained_ that you
referenced, he makes the point that it is the hardware of the brain that
is parallel, while the mind (in particular the verbal, reasoning part of
the mind) is a *serial* virtual machine running on that hardware: "a
virtual machine is a temporary set of highly *structured regularities*
imposed on the underlying hardware by a program." (My emphasis)

Dennett even suggests that talking to ourselves ("rehearsal, rehearsal,
rehearsal") is fundamental to how we learn.  I wouldn't disagree, but
would also think that there's an important role for associative
(parallel) thinking as well, especially in synthesis as opposed to
analysis.

Alexander then asks: "I wonder what kind of consciousness we would
develop if we had a parallel output device - e.g., have the skin surface
work as a hi-res display."

When we use our whole body (along with all the associated body language
that we've learned), as in dancing, does that qualify as a parallel
output device?

Actually, there is a wonderful recent story by Amy Thomson, _The Color
of Distance_ (11/95), that explores several forms of parallel
communication in an alien species called the Tendu.  The Tendu have
evolved from amphibians and are generally bipedal creatures.  Their
technology is oriented toward bioengineering rather than the creation of
mechanical artifacts. Their language involves gestures and symbols that
they generate on their chameleon-like skin.  But, their really neat
capability is a form of 'blood-linking' (through wrist spurs) called
'allua'.  They are able (Thomson does not go into mechanisms) to link
with others of their species this way (and other organisms as well) to
share nootropic hormones, perform medical diagnosis and even guide
biotransformations.  I imagine they do this through some type of
nanotech-like, software agents.

Linda Nagata's 1995 story, _The Bohr Maker_, goes beyond this to
envision people being able to release nanotech agents into the
environment from their pores, or special glands.  The agents then
circulate in the environment, searching for whatever they've been
programmed to look for, and then returning to their host for
'uploading'.  'People' could also communicate using these nanofog
agents.

But, it's not clear whether complex ideas or data streams could be
exchanged in either of these ways without ultimately passing through a
sequencing routine in the person's mind where relevant information would
be time-stamped, categorized and sorted.  But, it's a good question
whether some type of hypertext-like or 'mind-mapping' approach might
work just as well. I think that an interaction of both parallel routines
and serial routines are probably necessary for the type of experience
that we call consciousness.

Your argument is intended to cover both goods and information, I think.
With
respect to goods, your argument make the assumption that the cost of
transportation
is negligable, or at least that the cost is less than the difference in
cost
between the buyer's manufacturing cost and the seller's manufacturing
cost of the
good the seller is attempting to sell.

As your argument relates to information, you are correct. But I don't
need
much information to live lavishly, so you're not talking about the
difference
between life and death, as "making a living" means to most of the
world's
population. You are only talking about relatively marginal changes, in
some
sense. I believe that your economy reduces to only a trade in design and
other knowledge. Many designer will in fact make their designbs freely
available. This happens today, and is more likely to happen when the
designer doesn't have to worry about making a living.

Robin adds:
"The quality of a mailing list is a fragile thing.  If just takes a few
"bad apples" willing to post enough junk, and then people will stop
bothering to post a reply to every post they think is below par.  And it
goes down from there."

I'm not sure what is included in your definition of quality.  You imply
that posting 'junk' will spoil a mailing list.  But, as you point out,
the 'junk' can be ignored if it's not on your personal list of
priorities.  Far more fragile is the quality of civil discourse, which
(IMO) Reilly Jones has more seriously violated with his slurs about
"imbecility" and "conceptual drivel" and, less seriously, with his
apparent notion that anyone who speaks must do so with 100% certainty.

I really hope we don't poison this list by classifying people as
'nihilists' and 'imbeciles', nor condemn their ideas as 'conceptual
drivel' just because their thinking may be 'muddled' in some areas, or
their terms were ambiguous and their ideas may have been poorly
presented.

I ALSO REALLY HOPE THAT REILLY STICKS AROUND BECAUSE I THINK HE OFFERS
ALOT OF USEFUL INSIGHTS, OFTEN FROM A FRESH PERSPECTIVE.

When I said that Sarah's initial response to Reilly's initial post was
"incisive", I meant two things simultaneously: (1) It really 'ripped'
Reilly's post apart (perhaps a little too intensively, and he responded
in kind); and, (2) It was sharp and to the point in some instances.  I
used "incisive" in an ambiguous way. Does that qualify my statement as
'junk'? Should there be no subjectivity allowed on this list?

I am guilty of posting some 'junk' myself recently (mostly by improperly
using terms I'm still learning about, like 'ontology' and 'Markov
processes', in an ambiguous way or incomplete way), but as Sarah points
out:
"I had a short discussion ... which showed me flaws in my thinking and
allowed me to revise my ideas ... I'd hate to think I might have missed
that chance."

The Socratic method of the mailing list is a good place to learn and
clear up some confusion.  But every utterance shouldn't need to adhere
to strict scientific methods of experimentation, or formal logic, or
mathematical proof.  Neither should every utterance need to be
challenged - there should be some room for humor & banter.

Robin concludes:
"I think the net is in great need of some innovate alternatives to the
stark alternatives of open vs. moderated lists.  One idea I've played
with is a list pair, one open and one closed (to posting, but readable
by all).  To apply for membership in the closed list, you submit five of
your recent posts to the open list, which are forwarded to three random
closed list members for consideration."

So, for example, the closed list might contain your "Great Filter"
essay, but not all the rambling discussion of it that took place on the
open list.  This seems like a nice idea, more like an official journal
than a debating forum though.  Given limited list management resources,
however, it seems somewhat unnecessary to me - intelligent participants
can determine for themselves what posts contain significant ideas and
which are less formal or more conversational, or just items that *might*
be of interest to some.

Robin ends with:
"It is important to have a common sense of what some community is
seeing."

Would the 'authorities' on the closed list be obliged to consider all
sides of a debate?  If the community consists of all who participate in
the open list, can there be a "common sense" of what 'the community' is
seeing other than through the full and open forum?

I mentioned that I have been working on changing the ways I think and take in 
information over the past few years, and that I have been making myself 
several times more intelligent in the process.  Suresh Naidu responded:

"Really. Could give me some of the techniques you have been using. I would 
certainly appreciate any methods of making myself more intelligent.
How do you alter your ways of taking in information? More diverse media? How 
do you improve your observational and thinking skills. I just wrote a 
programming competition today, and I watched as I was stumped on one problem, 
a couple of people were burning up the score rankings. What makes a person 
have insights?"

My efforts to consciously increase my intelligence and my perceptual abilities 
were inspired a few years ago by reading Frank Herbert's wonderful book, Dune. 
 The main characters in the book were trained to be very perceptive and pay 
close attention to subtle details.  This was something that interested me very 
much; to increase the clarity of my perceptions, to see more detail.  So I 
began working on sensory training.

I started looking at things more intently, trying to see more detail, paying 
attention to notice everything I could about what I saw.  I go for walks quite 
often, and I try to pay attention to the exact details of things, not 
necessarily to remember the details, but to at least notice them.  I look at 
the trees as I'm walking past and try to see the bark in as much detail as I 
can, for example, and I try to do this with everything.  I notice all the cars 
driving by, all the birds flying, all the people walking around, the leaves 
fluttering on the trees, the way the clouds look in the sky, that piece of 
garbage being blown by the wind and the exact way it tumbles around; I try to 
notice everything I can.  I have taught myself to enjoy seeing things in great 
detail, and so I actively seek to see more and more detail, and this gives me 
great pleasure, so I keep trying to increase the resolution, increase the 
bandwidth.  I've learned to use all of my eyes' visual fields instead of just 
the center of them.  I have increased the amount of detail I see with my 
peripherial vision, as well as the amount of detail I see in the center of my 
eyes, so it has had the effect of widening my visual field, since I'm now make 
active use of all of it.  

I've done the same type of thing to my other senses as well.  I have made it 
extremely pleasurable to hear things in great detail, to hear and distinguish 
all of the many sounds going on all around me at the same time.  I have 
trained myself to find great pleasure in feeling the exact textures of the 
things I touch.  When I eat, I pay great attention to the exact way the food 
feels in all parts of my mouth, exactly how it tastes, how it smells, 
everything.  I try to pay close attention to the "exactness" of everything.  I 
have made this my goal, and when I acheive my goal each moment, I experience 
pleasure, and so I try to experience things even more exactly, and I 
experience even greater pleasure.

Basically, it's a matter of focusing one's attention on the details of the 
present moment.  And when the mind drifts off into its habitual thinking, I 
refocus it on the exactness of my present experience.  I keep reminding 
myself, Pay Attention, Pay Attention.  At first, it was very difficult to pay 
attention to things, but it becomes easier with practice.  The things I was 
working on a few months ago, I now do automatically, and it takes no effort to 
experience the degree of detail I struggled so hard to perceive earlier.  And 
now I still have many perceptual challenges, and I'm still working on 
increasing my observational abilities, and one day, these challenges will seem 
easy to me, and I will have still more refinement to make to my perceptual 
abilities.  There's just too much information to take ALL of it in, but I keep 
working to increase the amount I do take in.

So, my first interest was in increasing the amount of detail I experienced.  
Then I started applying the same techniques to my thoughts and feelings, and 
I've worked very hard to pay close attention to what goes on in my mind.  I 
always try to know my thoughts more clearly, to be aware more exactly what I'm 
thinking.  When I react to things, I try to keep track of exactly what I was 
thinking and feeling and what memories were brought up and what associations 
were made.  I keep working on experiencing my thoughts in greater detail.  I 
look for patterns in my thinking and explore why I think the way I do.  When I 
experience emotions, I go into them as deeply as I can and try to feel the 
exactness of what I'm feeling.  I watch all the memories that the emotions 
bring up, and I try to keep track of what thoughts and experiences seemed to 
trigger the emotions.

By watching my own thinking so closely, I notice thinking errors more easily 
and those errors get discontinued very quickly.  Also, as I learn to pay 
attention to more information, I am more aware of the background "noise" in my 
mind; all the loose ends and the thinking that usually trails off and doesn't 
go anywhere because it doesn't get paid attention to and followed up on.  I am 
aware of more of these random thoughts and associations going on, and I follow 
up on many more ideas than I used to and evaluate many more ideas than I used 
to.  Now it seems like my mind is in a perpetual brainstorming session.  I see 
all these ideas springing up and dying out.  The interesting ones get more 
attention and develop further, and the other ones just go away.  Because I am 
aware of more of my thinking, I am more aware of the random good ideas which 
spring up, and I am now almost constanly in a state of insight.  This gives me 
great pleasure, and it encourages me to pay even more attention to my 
thinking.  Also, exposing myself to diverse media (reading lots of books, 
seeing lots of movies, surfing the Internet, reading lots of magazines, 
looking at lots of art, listening to lots of music, etc.) helps refine my 
thinking even more, since I see examples of other people's actions and 
reasoning and can incorporate the good ideas into my own way of doing things 
and thinking.

One powerful technique I use to develop my reasoning skills and to clarify my 
thinking is to carry on imaginary conversations constantly in my mind.  I have 
many different models of thinking and different personalities that I've 
developed in my mind, and I have these different personalities discuss ideas 
with each other and explain things to each other.  Having to translate my 
ideas into many different personality and belief structures helps me clarify 
them and spot errors in them, and many of the different personalities are 
quick to point out each others' errors.  Also, when I'm learning something 
new, I imagine that I'm explaining it to someone else, and I imagine what 
questions they might ask, and I think how I would answer them, and if I don't 
have a good answer, then I seek out that information.  The internal discussion 
is an excellent way to test out ideas, and as I learn to pay more attention to 
the inner workings of my mind, I am able to develop more complex personalities 
and thinking styles and able to be aware of more elaborate conversations going 
on inside myself.  Most of the personalities I've developed come from 
simulating people I know, in my mind, by creating a mini-society in my own 
mind, based on real people in my life and people I see in movies or read about 
in books.

But my main technique for increasing my intelligence is to pay intense 
attention to all aspects of my experience and to continually work on 
increasing the level of my attention.  This takes a great deal of dedication 
and personal discipline.  I try to make it as enjoyable as possible so that I 
am more motivated to continue my work.  I also have trained myself to feel 
pleasure at accomplishing my goals.  I go outside for a walk, and everything 
looks so vibrant and clear, I hear all the sounds of the neighborhood all 
around me, I feel the patterns of air moving across my face and arms and my 
clothes rubbing gently on my skin as I move, and I feel elated, and I want to 
experience even more.  It has taken a while to build up this response, but it 
keeps getting stronger the more I work on it.  Also, the more attention I pay 
to things, the faster I learn them.

Another strategy I use to increase my ability to pay close attention to things 
is to engage in activities which are pleasurable anyway and then pay close 
attention to everything I'm experiencing while engaging in that activity.  
Eating and masturbation can be excellent activities for training the mind, if 
they're approached that way.  As funny as it may seem, fantasizing about 
sexual encounters can be an excellent way to develop a powerful imagination, 
if you keep trying to increase the vividness of the fantasy.  Sexual fantasy 
is very pleasurable, and the more vivid it seems, the more pleasurable it is, 
so there is a great motivation to increase the power of the imagination.  
Then, you can use your more powerful imagination for other things besides 
sexual fantasies, perhaps inventing some wonderful new machine, or thinking up 
a beautiful new artwork to create.  But the basic idea is to provide yourself 
with strong motivation to increase your ability to pay attention to things in 
great detail.  This ability can be applied to many aspects of your life, and I 
have used it to increase the level of my intelligence several times over, in 
the past few years.  It's been a lot of hard work, but it's been very 
enjoyable, because I've made it that way.  And it keeps getting easier to 
raise my intelligence even more, the more I learn and the more intelligent I 
become.  

Also, my sense of time has gotten pretty warped because of my work.  Now, a 
single day can seem as long as several weeks used to seem.  My thinking has 
speeded up considerably, along with the amount of information I process in a 
given amount of time.

When I would take acid a few years ago, I thought it was really cool, but the 
thing I didn't like is that it would wear off and the effects would go away.  
Now, because of my work, my ordinary experiences are more intense and 
wonderful than anything I ever experienced on acid.  It feels like I'm on acid 
all the time even though I'm not, but I don't seem to be coming down from the 
trip; I just keep going up, and things just keep getting more interesting, so 
very, very fascinating.

I'm in favor of some such list. I have just unsubscribed from transhuman
list and am about to unsubscribe from the extropy list because even just
scanning the often 40 or more messages a day is, to me, not worth the
benefit - too many insults, too much irrationality and too much shooting
from the hip. Yet, there are a number of very knowledgable, highly
intelligent and polite writers on these lists. I like the concept of peer
reviewed contribution admission to a public list.

Anyone want to run with this ball?

The generic AI is not a copy of myself. If I were to make a million
copies
of myself, I'd be in competition with each of them, and by the law of
supply and demand, while I may demand whatever I wish, I'm not going to
actually get that much. because one of those copies will undercut me.
In economic terms, the "clearing cost" will drop to the amount each AI
will
need to sustain itself, since the supply iseffectively infinite. This
subsistence cost will depend on the technology that sustains the AI. I'm
assuming that this ilower than the cost to sustain a human.

They start at minimum wage because of the law. We have unemployed
workers
because there are not enough minimum-wage jobs that are cost-effective
to
the employer at minimum wage.

Workers demand more pay for more responsible jobs because there are
fewer
jobs than workers of this type. Supply and demand.

If I had the hardware to support a million copies of myself, I would
organize it to support one of me that's a million times more capable,
if possible.

It's a truism in computer science that multiprocessing is a lot harder
than
single-processing. depending on the problem, the marginal utility of
additional processors can go negative after only a few processors, or
after
many. This is also true of personnel on a project. A big company does
more
projects. It does not generally do projects faster.

I feel strongly that speed of access to information and speed of

Computers are a new phenomon. Their impact is only now being seriously
felt.
So far, the contribution to knowledge has been mostly in the
infrastructure:
Communications, word processing, publishing, etc. More recently,
automated
lab insturments have dramatically increased progress in some fields,
notably
genetic sequencing. E-mail and the web are now the communications media
of
choice in several disciplines, including branches of math, astronomy,
and
physics. but also in other areas. Comuputers are now essential elements
in the
development of new digital circuits, including new computers. Thus, I
feel
that the situatin you describe is changing very rapidly.

I prefer not ot predict the exact nature of the way computers will
augment
intelligence, since IMO it's not central to our discussion. I feel that
uploading is considerably harder than other approaches to human/computer
collaborative entities.

This is likely to be correct. The "Singularity' affects only the meat
humans, not
the digital ones, assuming that the extended interacting algorithms
remain in the
form of individual uploaded humans. my guess would be that this is not
the most
efficient or the most likely form of the algorithm, however.

You are correct: these assumptions, and more, must be met for us to
achieve the "NanoDream." I think that it's unlikely, since I believe the
SI-precipitated SIngularity will occur first.

However, I feel that the idea that the present economy will evolve
without
revolutionary changes into a MNT economy also rests on many assumptions,
and that these are at least as tenuous. I apologize in advance for
not stating them in this post. I'll take a stab at it later.

        Thanks for that.  There was one thing I forgot to mention.  Having a
transhuman\extropian art ML shouldn't bar art threads from the other lists.
I think that art threads on the transhuman ML and the extropian ML are
great. They most certainly would have a larger audience, as well as maintain
an artistic 'left brain' side to both lists.  My suggestion for having TEAML
(acronym), is for the ones who would enjoy topics centered on >H and
extropian art.  My intention for the list is having it more as a specific
forum --kind of like having a cryonics or nanotechnology ML.  Most who would
be on the TEAML would (and should) probably be on the >H or extropian list
as well.  I presume there would not be too many messages per day...enough to
warrant a mailing list of this sort.

        I'm sure there's another art ML somewhere; probably quite a few art
MLs, but nothing like a transhuman\extropian art ML.  The main reason I am
subscribed to the transhuman and extropian lists is because I agree with the
vast majority of the topics conveyed.  Brain candy.  However, a scientist I
am not, an artist I am.  Why I would like to see TEAML get off the ground
(pun definately intended :-)) is because I know that the ones subscribed
will have very similar opinions as my own.  People who share the same
philosophical meme as me will have more of an understanding of what I am
trying to convey.  If I was to use the word 'automorph' (coined by our good
friend Natasha V. More --extropian artist extraordinaire) in one of my poems
and place it on another art ML, most -if not all- readers wouldn't be able
to grok it.  As is, a few of my poems such as "Unanimous Consent", "Best Do
It So", and "Casual Nobility" among others have brought forth comments of
misunderstanding by the readers.  If there was a mailing list for transhuman
and extropian artists, there would be a forum for knowledgable discussion of
artwork --both from on and off the list.  In effect, I have just gotten back
from a bit of a weekend 'sojourn' and I will continue my research on MLs and
carry on with my FAQ.  Responses of any sort are always highly valued.

People can drop out of the economy now, and have had this ability for
a very long time.  Surely you had a stronger claim in mind.

Sure computers are new, and will new kinds of impacts.  And at one
time cars were new, trains were new, radio was new, etc.   But the
question here is, do they fundamentally change the nature of economic
growth any more than these did?  You have stated your belief in this, 
but have not offered any reasons.

Sometines a few fast processors are best, sometimes lots of little 
ones are best.  That's the way it is now, and should remain.

I agree that uncivil posts hurt more, but poor quality posts also
cost.  It takes time for each of us to delete bad stuff.  And the fact
that many posters are not reading many other posts on the same topics

In response to my post on the Gradient Theorem, Dan Clemmensen 
says:

Yes.

Yes.  

Genie machines have, along with their many other nifty features, 
the ability to move things -- or to make trucks (or other devices) with 
which to move things.  Some people will find that they are better suited 
to this task than to anything else, and they will specialize in it.  They 
will use their genie machines to move things... in more mundane 
language, they will work for UPS.  The cost of transportation will be 
comparable to the cost of everything else in genie-land.  

The cost of making somthing in a large-scale genie machine (a factory), 
putting it on a truck or train, and shipping it somewhere, will be less,    
in many cases, than the cost of reprogramming a genie machine to make 
the item at home.  Just like now.  

The basic argument here is that you are trying to escape from the 
economic system, and I'm saying you can't.  You can make any 
assumption you want, consistent with physical reality, and I can show 
that even with that assumption, you will still be in an economy.  
I will give you SI, I will give you software that replicates itself, 
I will give you diamondoid materials:  and given all that, you will 
still be in an economy.  There is no escape!   <evil g>

A keen grasp of the obvious. Regardless of the culture and regardless of the 
technology and regardless of anything else, ANY society must obey a basic 
core of Economics ideas called Micro Economics, at least as long as that 
society is consistent with the laws of Thermodynamics. Nanotechnology does 
not postulate any new  laws of Physics so the laws of Micro Economics would 
still hold even after The Singularity, but beyond that there is little I can 
say about what life will be like then. I've said all this before, but you

May I drop a process question here?  Generally, when a process for 
discussion is designed, the designer makes some provision for the 
contribution of "minority" views.  (Recent debates regarding the 
social sciences and art have illustrated the mechanisms of this list.)   
How might you prevent the closed list from degenerating into intellectual 
insularity?

Most information in our minds never pass through our serial consciousness 
(it cannot - our conscious minds have a bandwidth on the order of 40 
bits/s, while we deal with megabits/s in the rest of the CNS). Actually, 
almost everything we do and think is done unconsciously, but our 
conscious levels are good at taking credit for what happens. 

My guess is that datastreaming will be a very subconscious "sense" - you 
"just know" that there are dangerous people up ahead, that Alex has a 
bright new idea for a nanointernet that fits with your theory of 
Beethoven or that the stocks in wormhole transport just soared.

I think we should try to find ways of communicating that are flexible 
enough to allow many different modes. I'm thinking of some kind of 
standardized mind-map with serial nodes linked by parallel/divergent 
arcs, which could automatically turn into hypertext, plaintext or other 
structures.

If we accept the argument in Drexler et al (UNBOUNDING THE FUTURE, 1991, p.
259), the only way to stop some demented or feckless brat from reprogramming
his genie to emit meteorological quantities Aum Supreme Truth happy gas, or

Much is being said, yet of little value. Sex appeared very early on the 
evolutionary theatre. Even the most primitive organisms have sex. I 
wouldn't count sex to traits that make us human, rather vice versa.

That sex seems to mean so very much for us, is an artefact of evolution. 
Should replication, as it is to be expected, to become detached from  
coitus, the act itself is going to become an atavism. 

A lovable atavism maybe, yet an atavism nontheless.

Chris, uploading means to bekome God. Not god, but God. It means you 
_define_ your own physics. The geometry of spacetime (or whatever you 
use for spacetime), the properties of the objects (if any) it contains, 
etc. etc.

This is way beyond wildest magick.

What is possible, is limited solely by your imagination, and the 
computation/minimal signal latency constraints achievable. (The latter 
only if you are concerned with efficiency reasons).

Trying to predict, how artificial reality will look like, which Beings it 
will inhabit, and by which motivations these Beings will be driven 
(economies?!) is quite quite a loss of time. Because artificial Beings 
will be different.

Count on it.

The other obvious way is to get the hell away from Earth as soon (or
better, before) we get that level of MNT. I'm actually worried about this,
and I hope whoever is going to move first to orbit or the belt has room
and need for a creative computer scientist/neuropsychologist... 

And keeping tight control over MNT won't work in the long run - unlike 
nuclear weapons there are no easy chokepoints (as far as we currently 
know). Even if the loonies don't do anything horrible, there are 
governments, corporations and careless scientists.

[I currently have grey, blue, green, red and golden goo mentioned on my
terminology pages. I wonder how many more kinds we will see when/if we get
MNT?]

Other than a good choice of initial list members, I don't see any easy
answers.  Everyone has a legitimate claim to representing some
minority view or another.  I'd pin my hopes on the fact that a sister
open list exists which a large fraction of the closed list people read.

This is a hard question. One that has taken up hugh amounts of list

Simply put this is will always have some "intellectual insularity" and
the reason for that to we trade off that for being able to have depth
discussion and debate on Extropian topics. As Robin pointed out there
are lists that are completely open. We risk "intellectual insularity"
to avoid having to to risk not being able to really fine hone our
intellect. We need some forum dedicated to advancing Extropian thought

I think it may well be that a hybrid of the two has merit: "hunches" you

rather akin to having interrogatable agents (I think of them as

It's hard to imagine anyone wanting to be on a second-class version of this
list.

I believe it was Benjamin Franklin who said "I'm sorry I wrote such a long
letter.  Had I had more time, I would have written a shorter one."  Rather
than restricting message length, however, I think this list could benefit
from a limit on the number of messages any individual can post on any given
day.  Would three be sufficient?  (Sorry, only one subject per message.)

I would at least try that before resorting to forced segregation.

I realize, I was talking about designs for city structures in the real world
and environment designs in upload VR.

Yes and I want to know people's fantasy worlds or what type of environment
they'd like to live in. The latter dealt with designs for city structures in
the real world.

Of course things will be completely different but why not fantacize (sp?)
now and use our creativity to come up with some good ideas on general design
themes so that we can begin building our worlds right after we're uploaded
having already thought the design through and as we get closer we can add to
it and make it more vivid? Also you meantion loss of time. What do you mean
loss of time? The singularity is right around the corner and you or I can do
nothing to stop it even if we wanted to. What could stop the singularity?

[I see that people who were on the list before it was open are concerned with
keeping this forum's value, and, being new, I repsect that wish, also,being
new, I wonder if I have in anyway contributed to the lack of quality...
however I cannot know because the comments about "junk"  are generalized, no
one has said who posts the "junk" or what catagorical "junk" is specifically,
as opposed to quality.
     The process which is being suggested is removed from anything I would be
able to participate in ( being a new person, who joined after the list opened
up). Please accept my comments in that observational, suggestive, uninvolved
light. ]

         I have been thinking about the original post about a senior member
group that juries our most recent posts and decides who can post  and
suggestions of a second list for the inferior.
I think that perhaps Max opening up the list ( which will certainly attract
more and more new and diverse and unknown  people)  may  at *first* have the
effect of disturbing the original quality earlier flow of ideas.  
Perhaps one will find that as people stay or dont-or learn and become more
articulate and knowledgeable -  we may find the list getting back to it's
original quality without a committee... 
: )

Self ownership.
I am not sure that limiting *who* is on would be better than addressing the
*content* of what is written , directly , specifically and at the time of
posting.

I will certainly do my best not to write "junk." I APOLOGIZE IF I HAVE, BUT
NO ONE HAS TOLD ME, AND SO I WOULDNT BE PRONE TO CORRECT IT IF SO.

I suggest that people who are aware of what "high quality " is might take
responsibility to make it known to those who aren't pleasing you, telling
them when and where this "junk" occurs, at the time, and instead of forming a
censorship bureau. This could  could be done politely and internally, by
posting a private email or by speaking up directly onto the list.

It might take some time and effort, but not nearly as much as reading every
single member's last five  posts and making the difficult group decision who
can and can't participate in the forum.

Spontaneous Order.
 I would hate to see a ruling collective of the Extropian list....

( For one thing, It s not exactly like there are millions and millions of
Extropians( YET), and two simultaneuos ( one "those of good quality" , one
for the "post challenged" ) lists seems a bit hard to imagine. And who would
want to be on the inferior list? )
This is just my HO, i am not into discussing how to control others.
I am here to learn and grow and hope to contribute to an Extropian future. I
have also dropped off the transhuman list, partly because of white noise,
rudeness and squabbling, but mostly to reclaim the useful time required to
read it.
I have opted to stay on this one so far.

Sigh.....of course the list will do whatever seems right, if it becomes
subject to a committee, and/or  divides into two lists, I will voluntarily
withdraw, because I cannot imagine myself wanting to participate in either
list.
Cheers. : )

I just realized that I've posted no intro to this list, so I will now 
indicate that I am a professional "process person", practicing 
mediation, facilitation, and system design.  This is the perspective 
from which I asked Robin about list insularity.

In light of Harry Hawk's comments, I will rephrase that into 
"avoid degenerating too far in the direction of intellectual 
insularity".  "Minority views" would include not only groups of 
persons numerically smaller but also new insights or approaches that 
might initially seem threatening to the established approaches.

Robin Hanson replies:
>I'd pin my hopes on the fact that a sister open list exists which a

You originally presented your idea as comprised of two sister lists.
A dynamic could develop wherein persons on the restricted list would 
notice posts on the open list that related to their issue areas, but 
my own experience with a somewhat similar structure indicates otherwise.

I have resided on a list-within-list structure, but the inner list 
was by invitation only and required clearance by several inner list 
members.  The two lists dealt with a human rights issue, and the outer 
list occupied the harassers while the real work was conducted on the 
inner list, which could not be read by the outer list.  
Eventually many persons on the inner list unsubbed from the outer 
list, considering it a distraction.

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

too much shooting from the hip. Yet, there are a number of very
knowledgable, highly intelligent and polite writers on these lists. I
like the concept of peer reviewed contribution admission to a public
list."

Depending on Internet traffic congestion and how often you check your
email, the number of messages you receive at any one time can now
approach 100 (I found 67 when I went into the office and checked last
Saturday afternoon, and many more came in while I worked), and it's
likely to get even worse if the list stays open and more people on the
net become interested in Transhuman and Extropian ideas.  I now think
Peter's right and some alternative for busy and/or serious readers is
desirable.

One alternative I have in mind seems simpler and more open than Robin's
idea and would guard against Kathryn Aegis's concern about a closed list
"degenerating into intellectual insularity".

The idea is that there would be a second list available where the
participants in a particular thread, or series of related threads, could
regularly post a summary of what their thread had been discussing.  This
would require some extra effort by those participants to summarize and
integrate their ideas.  If people on opposite sides of a debate couldn't
come to a consensus on what the summary should contain, each 'side'
would be free to post their own summary.

The fact that particpants would have to make this extra summarizing
effort might help insure that the second list wasn't so noisy as the
open list and provided the desirable "common sense of what [the]
community is seeing," that Robin mentioned.  Of course, some people like
to 'always' start their own threads and often post essay-length pieces. 
I guess if no thread developed on the subject and the poster thought it
was worthwhile, they could be free to forward their piece to the second
list after a while.

the bigger problem is that I'm not sure how this approach would help
those who want to receive newsy type information (e.g., conference
announcements or calls for comments regarding some formal research
effort) but don't have the time or interest in ongoing thread debates. 
Perhaps there could be a third list for this type of information?

No solution is going to be perfect and this approach could be subject to
abuse.  One way to supplement this approach, though it adds quite a bit
of complexity, would be to have the summary list be a Web archive that
does not get mailed out until a review committee has had a chance to
purge any spam that might have gotten in there.  I'm too much of an
Internet & Web novice, however, to know whether this idea (selecting and
mailing out Web documents) is practical.  Then, like the closed-list
idea, there's the problem of who would (and could) serve on this review
committee.

Many years ago I read a science fiction story which went along these 
lines:  

Dr. Paget was a mad scientist who found a way to create animals 
with human intelligence.  By "human intelligence" I mean the animals 
have a causal model of the world, as we do.  A Paget-dog (or padog) 
can cross the street without getting run over, just like we can.  
It understands its situation, it can make plans, it can communicate 
(using improvised signals and gestures) with other Paget-animals.  
Dr. Paget used horses, dogs, cats, rats, and mice in his experiment.  
So far all this is interesting but harmless, yes?  

But then the animals escape from the lab.  

The horses are quickly caught.  Horses are too big to hide and they 
reproduce slowly.  They never had a chance.  But the smaller animals 
disappear into the countryside.  

Some of the padogs and pacats are caught and killed.  The point is 
not lost on the other padogs and pacats.  They know that humans are 
The Enemy, and they act accordingly.  Soon there is a state of open 
warfare between humans and Paget-animals (usually known simply as 
"pagets").  Dr. Paget is lynched, and his son, who narrates the story, 
changes his name to avoid the same fate.  

A pacat who encounters a human will simply jump up into the human's 
face, scratch his eyes out, and jump back to the ground before the 
human can react.  Padogs run in packs and become expert at killing 
humans.  Parats and pamice learn to chew the insulation off wires, thus 
starting fires and making any kind of electrical equipment unusable.  
Cars and trucks are also unusable, because the pagets chew up the 
fuel lines, v-belts, hoses, and tires.  Civilized life becomes impossible.  
Humans revert to pre-industrial society.  Back to the jungle.  

The pagets reproduce much faster than humans, especially after 
parats discover how easy it is to kill human babies.  

After a few decades, the human population is reduced to a few million 
(in the whole world!) living in a state of siege.  

Unfortunately, Dr. Paget didn't find a way to create insects or bacteria 
with human intelligence.  That would be even more fun.  

As I said before, I don't think it is possible to miniaturize humans.  
But if I am wrong, I don't see how the Paget-scenario can be avoided.  
Small creatures (or robots) with human intelligence won't be our 
slaves, at least not very long.  Assuming they really do have human 
intelligence, they will soon find a way to escape (perhaps with help 
from sympathetic humans, or humans with more schadenfreude than 
sense).  Then we will try to hunt them down, and war will ensue.  
How else could it turn out?

More self ownership alternatives to a juried closed list:
- those who feel that they are qualified to judge what *is* quality, and/or
 who are respected as "elders" in the list, could come up with some sort of
system where they *star* or flag items which they find particularly
valuable... giving a guideline to what is expected, also keeping it positive
and constructive!  
Especially helpful in that  one could judge the quality by one's sown
criteria, not some removed committe or random selection of peers.... for
example if it was starred by some one I really respect, i would tend to read
that more than if someone starred it who i didnt.

I'm not following what is being left unsaid in this thread.

I expected this to be a high-quality low-noise ML that I'd have to 
pay a subscription fee for. My personal jury's still out on the
quality & noise issues, but one prior comment says something about 
Max More "opening" the ML.

So, forgive my ignorance, but what gives? Is nobody going to bill me? 
In that case, I may very well unsubscribe; I was interested in seeing 
what the fee structure weeded out, if anything.

 It was a tough decision to try this out because I didn't know what the 
billing structure was, and I was worried that I'd like it more than I was 
willing to pay for it.

        Absolutely no offense intended, but I personally would find it hard
to be 'appointed' to some list.  I see it not as a priviledge, but more of a
rise from a larger gang into a smaller, more elite, gang.  Why should my
opinion be so much more valuable than a newcomer's?  I'm sure if they have
extropian views, they probably have something to say.  I do agree with the

Yes I did. I'm a fairly lazy and disorganized person, and I tend to
believe
(probably incorrectly) that much of humanity falls into the same
category.
If I dropped out of the economy, I would not be able to enjoy a
comfortable
lifestyle today without effort. I assert that with MNT, I would be able
to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle without effort. The "without effort" is
the
difference. This means that I can spend my time doing what I want to do
to
satisfy myself, rather than doing what has the highest economic return.
Note
that today a person selects a job by making a tradeoff between
non-monetary
personal satisfaction and monetary gain. I assert that MNT will cause
this
tradeoff to shift entirely away from monetary gain for many people,
causing
them to effectively leave the economy.

        Sorry about responding to this thread so late...just catching up
from a weekend away (intentional useless information).  In all seriousness,
I had to read this thread's responses a couple times to make sure I was
reading correctly.  If we were to have two extropian lists (open and
closed), that would make the whole concept of extropy seem elitist.  I find
that the term 'junk' is totally subjective...you should know the saying:
"One man's junk is another man's treasure" and I believe that is true to
conversation as well.  There have been no recent posts (IMO) that have not
pertained to extropy in some way or another.  Sure, I disagree with personal
flames and insults, but I think that if someone doesn't want to read an
article by *insert name here*, I think that person can simply delete it
before it is even read.

        As for having an open\closed list etiquette, I strongly disagree.
Who's to say what is signal and what is noise?  I think list members can
filter the good from the bad on their own.  If there was to be a closed list
as well as an open one, the people from the open list will all want to be
'appointed' to the closed, and the people from the closed will pass judgment
on the open-listers.  Isn't extropy based around libertarianism?  If we were
to split the lists, it would be more like a two level hierarchy: the greater
and the lesser.  That would just not be good.  My solution?  Leave it as it
is and let the members 'excommunicate' their own responses.

        I'm not sure about Benjamin Franklin, but I know that Pascal wrote:
"The reason this letter is so long is because I didn't have time to make it
shorter."  More useless information from one of the open-listers!  :-)

Cars, Trains, and radio are not intelligence-augmemnting technologies
in the same sense that computers are likely to be. This is the crux

To the extent that I have any area of expertise, it's in the area of
distributed processing, computer communicatins, and multiprocessor
architectures. There is a very large body of research in this area.
Your statement is correct in the abstract, but in practice you start
with the fastest reasonable processor you can get. You don't use
multiple processor unless a single processor is very expensive.
For simple communications-intensive problems such as communications
switching, the power of a multiprocessing system goes up with the
log of the number of processors: for equal processors, a four-processor
system is twice as fast as a single-processor system. Different
problems have different characteristics, and the interconnection
topology can be optimized for the problem, but the algorithms get
complicated very quickly.

That was a bit cryptic, wasn't it? Your post mentioned knowledge and
processing power as contributors to intelligence. I assumed from context
that you were modelling an intelligent entity as containing a processor
and
a data store, along with other stuff. My point is that the data store
can be distributed and shared via communications. If it is, the complete
body of knowledge contributes to each intelligent entity. I propose
that the size of this database is not the only factor in intelligence:
the speed at which it can be accessed is also important.
   Consider: the WWW currently contains about 2 terabytes of accessible
information: so does a reasonable University library. However, I can
access the whole web rapidly. Thus the web amplifies my intelligence
more than all of the world's university libraries do.

I don't understand this assertion. There are irreducable costs in matter
and energy associated with the production of an item, based on the laws
of physics. There are additional costs in energy associated with
transportation. There are also capital costs associated with a
specialized
factory, and probably large capital costs (in real estate) associated
with transportation. These costs give my poor little home-brew MNT
thingee a large initial advantage that your economy must overcome.
Since neither of us really knows the actual efficiencies versus the
actual
costs, we are just stating opinions. But that's OK as long as we're
having fun.

Robin keeps saying that I can already drop out and become a mountain
man.
(In my day, we more frequently dropped out and became hippies in the
desert,
but you get the idea.) I only have to participate in the economy if
I want to. My decision to participate depends on whether or not the
economy
has something I want badly enough that I will participate rather than
making it myself. Currently, there are a lot of things in this category.
It's not clear that this will continue to be the case with MNT. The
decision
to drop out is not "econimically ratinal." Rather, it depends on my
personal decisions about how I wish to spend my time.

Note: a desision to drop out of the economy is not a decision to drop
out
of society. I can still contribute to the general discourse, or just
have fun
interacting with others. 

I actually believe that an MNT-based economy will arise, If there is
more
than one intelligent entity left after the singularity. However, I do
not
believe that the existing economy will evolve into the MNT economy. I
believe that the existing economy will undergo a meltdown.

Easy, appoint only TransIndividualists as arbiters. (:-) By definition they
take even their own views with a pinch of salt, and they won't agree even
among themselves on anything, so you'll be guaranteed a sort of moderated
openness that accepts everything except the negation of diversity itself.
Unfortunately, you'll have trouble recruiting them as the very concept of
moderating the views of others runs counter to their principles. (:-)

My point is, what is it about intelligence-augmenting, as opposed to
communication-augmenting, transporation-augmenting,
lifespan-augmenting, or any other X-augmenting new techology, that
leads you to expect some special different effect on economic growth?

Before continuing, let's have a look at that page.  Eric Drexler says:

This is not an argument, it's just a scenario.  At this point in the book, 
he takes it for granted that there is such a thing as molecular 
manufacturing, which can be used to make weapons.  The arguments  
for this are given much earlier.  

Of course, it is wise to assume that somebody may escape the bounds of 
regulation and use *any* technology to make weapons.  This concern is 
independent of the technology used.  He could say "biotechnology" 
instead of "molecular manufacturing," and the point would still be valid.  
As far as that goes, some people make effective weapons with fertilizer 
and fuel oil.

Well, an even better way to deal with this is to get the idea in focus,  
and see that it is basically absurd.  Making sarin with diamondoid-based 
assemblers is not going to be any easier than making sarin with 
biotechnology, or with conventional chemical synthesis.  In fact it 
would be harder.  

You could design a cell to synthesize sarin.  It would take a long time.  
It would take some expensive lab equipment, and some biochemists and 
biotechnicians with hard-to-acquire skills, but it could be done.  
Cells produce a lot of other toxins similar to sarin.  (There may already 
be a cell that produces sarin; I don't know.  In that case, your only 
problem would be to produce large quantities of it.)  

Designing a diamondoid-based assembler to make sarin would be much 
harder, because diamondoid machinery is intended to work with other 
diamondoid machinery.  Organic molecules like sarin don't fit into the 
neat diamondoid world of molecular manufacturing.  

If somebody wants to claim that the diamondoid genie machine will 
reprogram itself for free, so all you have to say is "I want a ton of sarin," 
and presto, it appears... all I can say at this point is:  balderdash.  

Designing and programming machinery to perform complex tasks 
isn't going to get any easier in the 21st century.  It will always be a job 
for experts.  Programming will not be free or instantaneous in the future 
any more than it is now.

I didn't expect so many followups, with so much emotion, to my
mentioning "one idea I've played with".  Just to be clear, I wasn't
making an official proposal for Extropians.  And I don't have any
great confidence that my idea would work - I'd just like to see some
alternatives tried somewhere somehow on the net.

It seems clear now that my proposal should not be described as trying
to modify a basic open list.  Rather, the idea would be to "add value"
with another list.  There are many open lists and newsgroups out there
with moderated lists/newsgroups made by someone who picks out what
they see as the good stuff from the open list.  This needn't be seen
as insulting those in the open list, or even insulting those who are
not picked.  Max has on occasion published exceprts from Extropians in
his Extropy magazine, but that shouldn't be seen as insulting everyone
who didn't get picked for exceprts, nor as insulting the Extropians
list.  And if someone wanted to create a "best of extropians"
moderated list, where they only post what they think is the best of
this list, I don't see why that should offend anyone here.

So, applying my idea to our example, the suggestion would be to create
another list, say "extropians-limited", with its own rules, which
would in no way affect this list.  This other list would start with
say three people, and then accept new posting-members based on a
submission process as I described.  Reading-membership would be open.
Many of you would not ask to join, because you didn't like the elitism
of the concept, or thought it would be too much work to agree to
review submissions.  But would you really be offended by the fact that
other people did want to join such a list?

When the prospect of Nanotechnology finely starts to show up on even the  
thickest politician's Radar screen (in other words when it's almost here) 
I have no doubt they will pass a gaggle of laws to try to regulate it. I also  
have no doubt that those laws will be about as effective as our current 
anti drug laws. All it would take is for somebody to smuggle out something 
smaller than a grain of sand and the ball game would be over. You could do 
even less, just encrypt the information, use Steganography to hide the message 
in the video of the 3D version of Rocky 17 or Rambo 14 and send it off into 
the internet. There is no way Big Brother could even tell there was a message 
hidden there, much less know what it said.
 
Restricting research on Nanotechnology would not work either. Unlike nuclear 
Physics you don't need huge machines to study it, you don't need enormous 
factories that easily show up on satellite photos to manufacture the critical   
ingredients for it, you could do it all in your kitchen, or a matchbox for 
that matter. Also, governments would be afraid to ignore Nanotechnology for 
fear that somebody else will find it first.

If by some miracle a government was able to control Nanotechnology it would 
only make things worse. Sooner or later any government will come under the 
control of somebody who is insane, if History is any judge it will be sooner  
rather than later, but it will certainly not be long by a Cosmological 
standard, and when that happens it will be all over. If things are spread out 
and decentralized with is no central authority, then even if most become 
suicidal there will always be a few who are not and they can carry on.

All this is not to say you haven't put your finger on a significant danger, 
you most certainly have. If a central government will not ensure a smooth  
transition to the age of Nanotechnology what will?  Damned if I know.

The personal filter concept that this list used to have doesn't work I
think.  It is important to have a common sense of what some community

I've had an all-year discussion with an architect friend in a different Net
forum about this need.  We are looking closely at the symbolism that ties a
community together, as well as demarcation issues, that is, defense of the
borders.  The necessity of hierarchical levels of authority lies behind the idea
of a cyber-enclave with security provisions consisting of write with permission,
read only - i.e., restricting ideas that come in, but not ideas that go out.
This is how churches and peer reviews always have worked.  Those who grant
permission of what ideas come in, are the authorities.  A twin pair of long-term
difficulties with such a conception, is a nasty tendency towards authorities'
hi-jacking of the good of all to their own good, and towards ideological
smugness.  For example, physics journals continue to publish speculative
theology, like the Big Bang doctrine, under the guise of scientific cosmology no
matter how much it increasingly resembles the ad hoc construction of the
Ptolemaic epicycles, to the exclusion of other, by definition, "crackpot"
notions.

Mark Crosby wrote 9/29/96: <Far more fragile is the quality of civil discourse,
which (IMO) Reilly Jones has more seriously violated with his slurs about
"imbecility" and "conceptual drivel"...>

"Imbecility" should be generously regarded as applying to the qualities of that
particular post, not the particular poster, and was used not as an ad hominem
against any given argument, but rather as an explanation, involving a value
judgment, as to why I wasn't going to respond at all.  The value judgment was
intemperate, I "felt" intemperate when I made it.  I hope you are not
invalidating my "feelings" or I might "feel" like you are being - horrors -
intolerant of me.  "Conceptual drivel" is a slur when it is misapplied, not when
it is factually applied.  Was there a violation of civil discourse?  Write to
Miss Manners, c.o. your local rag, for a ruling.  I await her judgment.

MC: <...and, less seriously, with his apparent notion that anyone who speaks

You may back this up with the appropriate quote from me, showing where I even
remotely asserted this.  I don't recognize it in the slightest.

MC: <I really hope we don't poison this list by classifying people as
'nihilists' and 'imbeciles', nor condemn their ideas as 'conceptual drivel' just
because their thinking may be 'muddled' in some areas, or their terms were
ambiguous and their ideas may have been poorly presented.>

I attempt to classify individuals' belief systems with a modicum of care, with
an eye to appropriateness.  Generally, posts stand on their own, beliefs stated
in the post prompt classification.  It's a wonderful shorthand method to pull
into context all the related beliefs that travel as worldview baggage along with
a specific belief.  Otherwise, my posts would be many times longer than they
already are, and that would violate net etiquette, which generally dictates that
we think and write in choppy, disjointed paragraphs, rather than in extended,
rich, contextual chains of reasoning.

<I ALSO REALLY HOPE THAT REILLY STICKS AROUND BECAUSE I THINK HE OFFERS ALOT OF
USEFUL INSIGHTS, OFTEN FROM A FRESH PERSPECTIVE.>

This must be the carrot-and-stick approach.  My self-esteem just went from the
cellar through the roof.  I'm giddy!

<When I said that Sarah's initial response to Reilly's initial post was
"incisive", I meant two things simultaneously: (1) It really 'ripped' Reilly's
post apart (perhaps a little too intensively, and he responded in kind); and,
(2) It was sharp and to the point in some instances.>

Perhaps I responded in kind, intensively, sharp and to the point.  I hope you're
not making an argument for a double standard of posting style.

MC: <I used "incisive" in an ambiguous way. Does that qualify my statement as
'junk'? Should there be no subjectivity allowed on this list?>

Far be it from me to armchair psychoanalyze this.  I'll just take it as
rhetorical filler.

MC: <I am guilty of posting some 'junk' myself recently...>

I've heard that confession is good for the soul.  <g>

MC: <Neither should every utterance need to be challenged - there should be some
room for humor & banter.>

This is why I didn't respond to Sarah's post to begin with.  I try to include
some humor and banter routinely, some enjoy it, some don't.

MC: <Jeff Dee thoughtfully wrote in response (that is, he made a constructive
rather than destructive criticism)>

Tut, tut on me.  Maybe Jeff could give me some pointers.  Seriously, though, go
back and read my posts, I have included a wealth of constructive ideas, and
constructive sources to pursue.  If you only want to dwell on the negative,
that's your perogative, but it doesn't make the positive nonexistent.

MC: <I'm also 'certain' that we can never be completely certain about most
*things*, as opposed to *feelings*.  Is that a paradox or "conceptual drivel"?>

Neither, it looks like a true statement to me, particularly if you substitute
"purposes" for "feelings."

Michael Butler wrote 9/30/96: <My major complaint is with people who repost vast

A pet peeve of mine also.

Kathryn Aegis wrote 9/30/96: <I have resided on a list-within-list structure,

Eric Watt Forste wrote 9/28/96:  <I suppose I prefer to place my personal
emphasis on intolerance of authoritarian violence rather than on intolerance of
servility. It just seems like a more direct approach to me.>

This is not a superficial preference.  It is not clear which is more of a direct
approach.  Servility-and-authoritarian violence is a coupled dynamic system,
like knower-and-known, interpretation-and-map, intention-and-action.

Since toleration of entropy is ruination, intolerance of it becomes a duty if
the dynamic pursuit of extropy is our chosen purpose.  This is a correct value,
or moral certainty.  You can fight entropy on many fronts:  against the servile
society, against authoritarian violence, or even against our own tendencies
towards slobbery.

Fighting the servile society is like a pre-emptive strike, e.g., Alexander Pope
and Samuel Francis.  This helps stave off the worst of the authoritarian
violence if a relational threshold of individuals (I'm thinking of percolation
theory), turns from wave-bobbing towards extropy.  Fighting authoritarian
violence often is required late in the game, after an oppressive elite is
entrenched in power, e.g. Alexandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov.  You can't
wait until no independent powers are left in the world to start the fight,
because the internal fight must have external support.  Waiting until America
surrenders its sovereignty to a World State is too late to start fighting
authoritarian violence, there will be no external support.

Many thinkers have noted the coupling of servility and authoritarian violence.
Alexis de Tocqueville noted that "servility will cower to force, and adulation
will follow power."  He warned against the servility of a radical
egalitarianism:  "What resistance can be offered by customs of so pliant a make
that they have already often yielded?  What strength can even public opinion
have retained when no twenty persons are connected by a common tie... and when
every citizen, being equally weak, equally poor, and equally isolated, has only
his personal impotence to oppose to the organized force of the government?"
  
George Santayana wrote:  "In any close society it is more urgent to restrain
others than to be free oneself.  Hence the tendency for the central authority to
absorb and supersede such as are local or delegated."  Restraining those who
cannot restrain themselves calls forth more and more central authority, whose
elite pursues their own ends, not the general good.  Those ends are invariably
the accumulation of power and wealth, the achievement of which encourage the
elite to keep those restrained from developing the facility of restraining
themselves.

Servility-and-authoritarian violence ratchet up and down together, but the
beginning point for both upward and downward movement is with servility.
Giambattista Vico's axiom is:  "Governments must conform to the nature of the
men governed."  Governing over the dissolute calls forth the demogogue, the
tyrant.  This follows from Vico's additional axioms:  "He who cannot govern
himself must let himself be governed by another who can," and preceding Darwin
by 115 years, "The world is always governed by those who are naturally fittest."

Here lies real trouble with governmental minimalism.  The only way that minimal
government can work, is when individuals govern themselves.  But individuals
cannot govern themselves without learning to obey themselves, that is, to place
their animal desires for vacant freedom under the sovereignty of their rational
mind which understands the nature of the limitations external reality places on
us.

And individuals can never learn to obey themselves - that is, develop
self-control - unless they have learned to obey someone above them.  In a
radically egalitarian society, there *is* no one above them, not their bosses,
not their leaders, not their priests, not their parents.  They simply do not
need to learn how to obey authority, because authority is not allowed to
maintain itself in conditions of concrete equality.  Hence, they cannot govern
themselves, and the state grows and grows by necessity, in direct proportion to
the degree that individuals cannot govern themselves.

Unless there is a policeman inside your head, a policeman must be assigned to
you.  In addition, a policeman must be assigned to each policeman, ad infinitum.
Very quickly you run out of individuals to do the policing necessary.  We are at
this point now, when 40% of GDP goes to government.  For the ideal of minimum
government to work, you must have maximum self-government, and this you can only
have with legitimate hierarchical levels of authority.  But governmental
minimalists often hate hierarchical authority because it so obviously hems in
our freedom, our ability to do as we please - a conundrum.

The popular bumper sticker "Question Authority" taken literally is largely
harmless, a banal platitude typical of shallow thinking-in-slogans suitable to
"Generation Duh."  But many individuals, steeped in radical egalitarianism, do
not stop at the common sense meaning, they go on to interpret it as if it meant
"Deny Authority."  Now we're in trouble.  Santayana warned:  "Freedom is
legitimate when it does not usurp authority....  The great moral error is not to
admit authority at all."

The historically recent virtual renunciation of authority has had unpleasant
side effects.  I can still vaguely remember when a Ph.D. conferred more status
on an individual than a shoe salesman had, and when to be a professional didn't
automatically evoke "hooker," selling their integrity to the highest bidder.
But that was thirty years ago.  For the last five years, the operating principle
of the public schools has been that no one will be more educated than the least
educated.  My memory of a time of professional integrity and intellectual
distinction has faded considerably, the nihilistic/egalitarian rot has set in so
fast.  This dual rot produces, on the one hand, individuals who think 'Who
cares?' about status, respect or anything; and on the other hand, individuals
who care deeply for undifferentiated equality amongst everyone, with the
exception of themselves, who, of course, are more equal than the rest.

Thomas Molnar, in "Authority and its Enemies" (orig. 1976, rev. 1995) again
noted the coupling of servility-and-authoritarian violence, but expanded on its
relation to the legitimacy of authority: "Authority is only mocked and despised
when it is obviously antirational or when it is declining, when the men in power
are themselves no longer convinced of its beneficial presence.  Then... they
abdicate and yield authority to men more determined than they are.  It is the
immemorial experience of mankind... that the decline of authority leads to the
permissive society, which then ushers in the rule of brute force."

Authority is declining because of a systematic attack on Reason itself.  You can
no more squeeze blood out of a turnip, than you can squeeze extropy out of
scientific nihilism, cultural relativism, and historical revisionism.  They are
not to be tolerated.  Vico refers to these as the barbarism of reflection, and
noted it to be a worse scourge than the barbarism of sense, like the Huns,
Mongols and Vikings.  "For the [barbarism of sense] displayed a generous
savagery, against which one could defend oneself or take flight or be on one's
guard; but the [barbarism of reflection], with a base savagery, under soft words
and embraces, plots against the life and fortune of friends and intimates."

Molnar goes on to explain:  "Authority does not become irrational by the fact
that *will* is one of its essential components, nor does it become tyrannical by
the fact that it is an articulator and preserver of inequality.  If a society,
with its rich articulation, is reduced to an undifferentiated mass, it is not
authority it will face, but the most oppressive despotism.  Those who exercise
authority must, therefore, have the courage and the will to lift - and keep -
society above the temptations of the anthill."  And those who don't exercise
authority, must be individually intolerant of authoritarian violence.  They also
can go a long way towards preventing authoritarian violence from arising, by
being intolerant of servility - of the wave-bobbers - calling them to turn
towards extropy, and setting a living example of the fruits of such a turn.

Having the inner list not openly readable is different from my
proposal.  But you haven't mentioned the most important thing - did
the inner list work well for insiders?  If so, sounds like a success
story.

I'm not sure you'll get people to put in this effort, but I have no
objection to your trying it.

What is the difference between this and a moderated "best of" list?
I don't see how it is any less objectionable on elitism grounds.

When you buy from a business, you directly help me, your fellow man, by
paying my salary.   Is that greedy or selfish of me and my big-business
employer?

There is nothing more selfish or greedy than a government who spends probably
100%+ of my tax dollars on interest payments (I call it the "blackhole").  

That tax money goes to pay someone else's salary probably not even in the
Western Hemisphere.  Because of this, the tax money doesn't really go for the
things you think it does.  

Besides, taxes increase business operating costs forcing my company to reduce
my salary or lay me off.  When you pay your taxes you do not help me.  

However, I do not expect to be helped by you or others for "free".  I don't
want government charity either.   I think you and I must _both_ make a
satisfying exchange (e.g.monitary) or I perfer NO deal at all.  If you don't
think my business is worth buying from, you should not buy from me.

"LSD Psychotherapy" by Stanislav Grof is worth a look.

The Multidiciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (which has a

current
research on Ibogane. It induces a trance like state in which one can
view
painful memories without the disabling emotional charges and seems to
work
well with addictions.

I see three cases with this superset stuff.

1. Both sets have a finite number of elements. The subset has
fewer elements. There are elements in the superset which are not
in the subset. Subset ~= Superset.

2. Both sets have an infinite set of discrete elements, such as
the set of integers. 

3. Both sets have an infinite set of non discrete elements, such
as the set of real numbers.

In cases 2 and 3, Cantor proved long ago that these sets can be
mapped into each other. Subset = Superset in the number of elemnts
present. However there are still an infinity of elements in the
superset not in the subset. Subset still ~= Superset.

If the universe is a finite collection of digital elements, case 1
applies. If the universe is infinite, cases 2 or 3 apply.

I'vd been reading a book, "The Conscious Mind" by David Chalmers,
Oxfore University Press, 1996, ISBN 0-19-510553-2.

Chalmers takes the notion that qualia, or our direct experience of
phenomena as a indication that consciousness is irreducible and not
explainable as part of other systems, such as materialism. About the
first half of the book is devoted to arguments concerning this. (I had
a hard time with this, for I basically disagree, in that I feel that
memory is essential to the experience of consciousness.)

Then we get to the interesting stuff. Chalmers suggests that the qualia
in
functionally isomorphic systems are identical. A model of my brain will
have
and be conscious in the same way that I am.

He demolishes Penrose's contention regarding our ability to comprehend
Godel sentences quite concisely:

	The short answer to these arguments is that there is no reason
	to believe that humans can see the truth of the relevant Godel
	sentences, either. At best, we can see that if a system is
	consistent, then its Godel sentence is true, but there is no
	reason to believe that we can determine the consistence of 
	arbitrary formal systems. This holds particularly in the case
	of complex formal systems, such as a system that simulates
	the output of a human brain: the task of determining whether
	such a system is consistent might well be beyond us. So it may 
	well be that each of us can be simulated by a complex formal
	system F, such that we cannot determine whether F is consistent.
	If so, we will not be able to see the truth of our own Godel
	sentences. (Page 330)

His discussion of quantum mechanics is also interesting, in particular
his
view toward Emmet's ideas which are often misstated as the "many worlds"
interpretation of QM.
