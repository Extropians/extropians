I usually read nonfiction, but I'm really getting into sci-fi now. Any other
science fiction recommendations?

I really liked "Snow Crash," but cared less for "Neuromancer" (anyone else
disappointed?). "True Names" was OK. Right now I'm reading "Burning Chrome,"
which is OK and I just bought some Heinlein books.

"The Silicon Man," "The Probability Broach," and "Orwell's Revenge" (tho'
not exactly sci-fi) sound good. Suggestions?

Thanks.

Astronomers have recently discovered a huge jet of antimatter in the
Milky Way's northern axial region. Its theorized that it is caused
either by the collision of two neutron stars or by a cascade of novae.

The importance of this discovery is that we now have direct observation
of a phenomena that could be the source of a phenomena known as Gamma
Ray Bursts. Up to now, astophysicists have only been able to theorize on
the cause of the GRBs.

That was me posting nonsense on April 1st.  There is, to the best of my

Pretty soon, an "internet cult" is going to be defined as:

A group of individuals who have a common bond, and seek to discuss, question
and research matters which the group has deemed significant.

Once all these ‘cults’ are eradicated, the internet will be corporate
America’s machine, and will be worse than T.V. - a bunch of ads, and things
I don’t particularly care for.

It depends on whether "genes" (not necessarily DNA) can directly code
for the value "maximize your long term domination of the population".
So far at least, this has been too abstract to code for, so life has
had to make do with coding for more direct values aimed at this final
value.  If there are more direct values that turn out to be
equivalent, and there are given certain assumptions, then evolution
may never go the final abstract step.

Disclaimer:  This may be an urban legend, I have not checked up on it as I 
honestly don't care but...

Several (10+) years ago a friend of mine claimed his brother 
(brother-in-law?) was with the Chicago Bears finance branch as legal 
counsel.  Supposedly the players would receive a check (average $11,000) on 
a Thursday (dunno if this was a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly payment). 
 These same players would be back on Tuesday of the following week begging 
for advance pay as they had spent the entire $11,000 over the weekend.

Money can buy happiness but it can't buy common sense.

{SNIP}   It says that the poor (this is

If a govt. has the competence and power to suppress slightly valuable
inventions (as I've heard the FDA has done with some drugs) then it's
not unreasonable, and is certainly not morally culpable, to believe it
has the competence and power to suppress spectacularly valuable inventions,
I think.

Hm.  That antimatter is, if I understand antimatter correctly, now long
gone.  I wonder how I'll get close enough to make use of some without
hurting myself if by the time I see the radiation from it, it's gone?

BTW -- it's one phenomenon, two phenomena.

        "The Illuminatus! Trilogy" by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson is
very good.  Though not totally sci-fi, it deals (in an outrageously
hilarious manner) with many topics that extropians find of value.

        Also, David Zindell's books "Neverness", "The Broken God" and "The
Wild" are exceptionally well written and also deal with immortality
(physical and mental) and a large number of scientific progresses
--including nanotech, cryonics, uploading, cloning etc.

It is worth reading even if you hate it. But I really recommend "The 
Anthropic Cosmological Principle" by Tipler and Barrow; less pop-sci and 
pop-religion, and more science (this was the book that made me a 
transhumanist). 

"Out of Control" by Kevin Kelly is a bit hip, but it contains plenty of 
fun stuff relevant to extropianism.

P.S. I'm sorta surprised at how antique most of the book 
recommendations have been, though there's nothing wrong with the 
classics...

(As a friend of mine said (who is an extropian and visiting) says, "If
extropians are ever investigated for being a cult, we would be cleared of
being a cult.")

Michael Lorrey replied to Carl:

"It was on April 1st, get it?"

While Dan Sale mused:

"Pretty soon, an "internet cult" is going to be defined as ...

And Robert Schrader's commentary explained:

"That was me posting nonsense on April 1st.  There is, to the best of my

my deranged brain."

This was a pretty funny joke, and I laughed out loud after the initial shock
wave running through my veins.  Cults have very bad press - not my vision
for association.

Now, wouldn't it be just cryo to read one sunny morning:

"A few weeks ago the Los Angeles Times, extropians were being interviewed
for being international innovators of cultural change."

There are two conferences in the next ten days which you may find
of interest.  I am going to both, and would be happy to meet people
from the list there.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 Montreal, May 5 and 6 "Consciousness and frontiers of neuroscience"
There will be some interesting people - David J. Chalmers,
Patricia S. Churchland, and others.

More info available at

http://WWW.CAM.ORG/~cyrd/CRSN/XIXSymposium/index.html

Registration for the conference is $100 Canadian (about $70 US) or $35
cdn (~$25 US) if you can pass off as a student. Banquet at 7 on Monday,
that's another $65

It's a pretty late stage of the registration process, but it's not
yet closed.

And annoy those who prefer not to use unreliable RAM-hogs like Netscape
for web-browsing. I'm amazed by the number of web sites which are barely
usable even with Netscape with images disabled, let alone without
variable-sized fonts.

If a govt. has the competence and power to suppress slightly valuable
inventions (as I've heard the FDA has done with some drugs) then it's
not unreasonable, and is certainly not morally culpable, to believe it
has the competence and power to suppress spectacularly valuable inventions,
I think.

In case anyone's interested in the Iridium satellite communications
system... I'm hoping it will be operational before my next long trip so I
won't need to use Net Cafes and friends' computers for connectivity again.

Delta 2 Rocket Prepared For May 2 Return Flight

McDonnell Douglas Aerospace is preparing for a May 2 return-to-flight
launch of its Delta 2 rocket, after receiving informal indications late
last week from the U.S. Air Force that it would be cleared to use the
launch range.

Five Iridium mobile telephone satellites are scheduled to be launched
on the rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. The launch will be
the first Delta 2 mission since a Jan. 17 Delta 2 explosion destroyed
an Air Force navigation satellite.

*Unless* you put another polarizer at 45 degrees in between the two, in
which case the photon has a 25% chance of passing through all three, even
though it can't pass through the two crossed polarizers. Polarization is 
even weirder than it first appears.

    of the SP - which uses 30 P2SC or Power Two Super
    Chip processors. As a result, it will run about twice as fast
    as last year's system. And as Murray Campbell says, "...in
    chess programs, speed is very important. The faster you
    are, the stronger you play."

    Secondly, Deep Blue's "chess knowledge" has improved
    since last year. Working with international grandmaster Joel
    Benjamin, the development team has spent the past several
    months educating Deep Blue about some of the finer points
    of the game.

    Last year, Deep Blue averaged about 100 million chess
    positions per second. This means it examined and evaluated
    100 million different chess positions every second. This
    year, the developers estimate that Deep Blue will work
    about twice as quickly - that is, 200 million chess positions
    per second.

    Incidentally, Garry Kasparov can evaluate approximately
    three positions per second.

New Documentary on Waco to show in Austin this Week

A new, million-dollar production about the government's role at the Waco
disaster is creating quite a stir as it is shown around the nation.  The
documentary comes to Austin this week and will show at the Dobie Theater
beginning this Friday.  The Friday 7 p.m. showing will be followed by a
panel of Waco survivors discussing the incident and taking questions from
the audience.  Movie times can be obtained by calling 472-3456.  What
follows are excerpts of a review of this movie that appeared in the March
14th issue of The Texas Observer:  


Waco: The Rules of Engagement, A film by William Gazecki and Dan
Gifford.  More than a year has passed since the Justice Department
admitted that its troops had been trigger-happy at Ruby Ridge, but the
Feds' position on Waco hasn't changed. "We looked at the entire
situation and we made the best judg-ment we could," Attorney General
Janet Reno maintains. . ..

Waco: The Rules of Engagement is a critical look at the 1993 assault
on the religious group led by David Koresh, and it's unlikely that
anyone who sees the nearly three-hour documentary will agree with the
Attorney General. The film is playing to unexpectedly large
audiences. It opened at Utah's Sundance Festi-val in January, played
at A&M's Texas Film Festival in February . . ..

Rules of Engagement doesn't use drama for polemical purposes or make
claims it can't sustain. It is not the child of a garage or attic
studio: its makers say it has cost nearly a million dollars, and as
docu-mentaries go, it has the feel of a real flick: dramatic
structure, soundtrack, tear-jerking conclusion, the works. Director
William Gazecki and executive producer and writer Dan Gifford are not
Hollywood big names, but that, after all, is the point of film
festivals.

The film's summary of the issues surrounding the Waco affair
demonstrates newsman Gifford's be-lief in "balanced reporting." The
documentary includes Congressional testimony by Kiri Jewell "the
teen-ager who claims she was sexually molested by David Koresh" and
the stinging critiques of New York Congressman and gun foe Charles
Schumer, the charging bull of the 1995 Congressional hearings on
Waco. Even Janet Reno mutters her story, saying, among other things,
that the tanks that the FBI deployed at Mount Carmel were "like a good
rent-a-car."

The film presents a half-dozen sources that print journalists . . .
couldn't tap in the years immedi-ately following the events. The prize
catch, brought in by researcher Mike McNulty, a Colorado insurance man
turned Waco sleuth, is leathery McClennan County Sheriff Jack Harwell,
who had little to say during the fifty-one-day siege in 1993. In the
film, Harwell doesn't exactly call federal lawman flatfeet or
murder-ers, but what he does say raises some important questions about
the sanctioned version of the Mount Car-mel story. "We had a bunch of
women, children, elderly people, they were all good, good people," the
sheriff says. "I was around them quite a lot. They were always nice,
married, they minded their own busi-ness, they were never
overbearing."
. . ..

At Sundance, viewers who sat through this long film despite knowing
how it would end, didn't even yawn during its lengthy re-runs of
C-Span Congressional testimony. And when the film did end, the
festi-val's ski-and-film buffs were convinced that the government's
hands are not clean.

Even liberals as confirmed as Carol Gnade, director of the Utah
chapter of the American Civil Lib-erties Union, left the film
perturbed. "My gut feeling when I was watching," she says, "was that
there was so much that as a citizen I didn't know about what happened
at Waco. Organizations like the ACLU and NRA have to keep a closer eye
on events like that."

Few issues connect interests as diverse as the ACLU and the National
Rifle Association"which is one of the oddities that keeps the Waco
controversy alive. Rules of Engagement further erodes the official
version of what happened in Waco in April 1993. With any luck, the
film will create enough public pres-sure to elicit new information
about a mystery that refuses to die.

Thank you for sharing this.  

There is a PBS series called "Mysteries of the Universe" (what a dumb 
title) that is doing excellent interviews with astronomers making 
breakthroughs in space research, such as the discovery of new planets 
and the processes by which stars create new planets.  Wonderful 
computer graphics and space photography as well.  It's in my area 
now, but it may make the rounds of other stations.

Science fiction in general is going through a dismal period where 
many of the established writers simply have run out of strong viable 
story ideas, or their outlines are being farmed out to less able 
writers by the publishers.  A glut of badly-written books, a few 
journals going under, a general weeding-out process of a bloated 
market.  How I miss the pulp journals!  But I guess eventually all 
these processes balance themselves out and more innovative writers 
will become known.  

If you can find it, pick up a copy of the latest _Analog_, they 
usually have a decent short stories and some science news.  Also, Ben 
Bova has a new book out that utilizes nanotech as a plot device, it's 
called _Moonrise_, I think.

But does this equate to DB playing twice as fast a game of chess? If its
searching through an enormous tree of possibilities in a relatively dumb
way then what is the real difference b/w 100M and 200M of possibilities?
The ability to look an extra move ahead? Certainly it isn't the ability to
look twice as far ahead. I would guess that the way they are improving its
heuristics are actually much more important than this doubling in
processing power.

NASA EXPLAINS HOW MOLECULAR-SIZED GEARS MIGHT WORK

A technical paper sponsored by NASA and recently accepted by
the journal "Nanotechnology" explains how molecular-sized gears
might work.

"Thanks to simulation of molecular-sized gears by a NASA
supercomputer, hope is growing that products made of thousands of
tiny machines that could self-repair or adapt to the environment
can ultimately be constructed," said Al Globus, a co-author of the paper.

Authors are Jie Han, Al Globus, Richard Jaffe and Glenn
Deardorff of NASA's Ames Research Center, Mountain View, CA.

Researchers have simulated attaching benzyne molecules to the
outside of a nanotube to form gear teeth, explained Globus.
Nanotubes are molecular-sized pipes made of carbon atoms.  "You
also need a cooling system for gears.  We used a supercomputer to
simulate successful cooling of molecular-sized gears with helium
and neon gases," he explained.

To "drive" the gears, the computer simulated a laser that
served as a motor.  "The laser creates an electric field around
the nanotube.  We put a positively charged atom on one side of the
nanotube, and a negatively charged atom on the other side.  The
electric field drags the nanotube around like a shaft turning," he said.

"These gears would rotate best at about 100 billion turns per
second or six trillion rotations per minute (rpm)," he added.  The
gears that Globus and others have simulated with computers would
be about a nanometer across.  A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter.

One practical use of nanotechnology would be to build a
"matter compiler," said Creon Levit, a Globus colleague at Ames.
"We would give this machine, made of nano parts, some raw
materials, like natural gas, for example.  A computer program
would specify an arrangement of atoms, and the matter compiler
would arrange the atoms from the raw materials to make a macro-
scale machine or parts," Levit added.

"A matter compiler is not just science fiction.  In the
biotechnology industry, there are already 'peptide synthesizers'
in use.  You give them a sequence of amino acids you want
produced, and the machine will create those peptides.  But you
can't make rockets out of peptides," he said.  A peptide is a
sequence of amino acids.

"A step along the way to make an aerospace matter compiler is
an even smaller hypothetical machine, the 'assembler/replicator,'"
said Globus.  "The replicator can make a copy of itself, just as a
living cell can duplicate itself.

"We would like to write computer programs that would enable
assembler/replicators to make aerospace materials, parts and
machines in atomic detail," he said.  "Such materials should have
tremendous strength and thermal properties."  Further information
on these materials can be obtained on the researchers' Internet
page at URL:

http://www.nas.nasa.gov/nanotechnology.

An image of the nanogear from a computer simulation is
available at the following URL:

http://ccf.arc.nasa.gov/dx/basket/storiesetc/Nanopix.html

A long range goal, according to Globus, is to make materials
that have radically superior strength-to-weight ratio.  Diamond,
for example, has 69 times the strength-to-weight ratio of
titanium.  A second goal is to make "active" or "smart" materials.

"There is absolutely no question that active materials can be
made," Globus explained.  "Look at your skin.  It repairs itself.
It sweats to cool itself.  It stretches as it grows.  It's an
active material," he said.

Globus strongly emphasized that making real nanomachines may
be decades away, but he said that computer simulations suggest the
tiny machines are possible after engineers learn to build
nanoparts and to assemble nanomachines.

The nanogear and other related Ames research is a
collaboration between the Ames Numerical Aerospace Simulation
Systems Division and the Ames Computational Chemistry Branch.

Indeed.  THE NEW YORK REVIEW OF SCIENCE FICTION  has been running sorrowful
editorials and discussions about the `death of science fiction' - and this
is a very insiderly source, run by cutting-edge editors.

On the other hand, there are some wonderful books still appearing, in many
ways deeper and richer and with far more literary density than has ever
appeared in the genre (or adjacent to it) before.  I've just read, and
strongly recommend, Richard Powers' 1995 novel GALATEA 2.2 [hope I'm not
repeating myself here; with e-lists one tends to forget what one posted
last week, or even last night].  It's a novel about a fucked-up and blocked
writer (yawn) who returns home to Urbana-Champaign and visits the AI labs
(where HAL was activated, you'll recall).  There he gets dragged into a bet
between contending AI factions, and spends many months teaching a massive
neural net, through various instantiations, to use English As She Is Spoke.
 Does the machine come alive?  Is it a Stanislaw Lem-style Golem by the
end, or Heinlein's Mike?   It's amazing stuff, beautifully written, and as
far as I can see pretty well informed with up-to-date AI theory.

Whatever Gamma Ray Bursters are (an Industrial accident?) they're really odd 
and we now know, the most powerful thing since The Big Bang. They happen once  
or twice a week in our observable universe, come from random directions, last  
from several seconds to several hours, never come twice from the same place, 
and produce incredibly  intense Gamma rays, but very little in any other part 
of the electromagnetic spectrum, not even X rays. Just a few weeks ago for the 
first time, a very faint optical and X ray counterpart to a Gamma ray Burst 
was detected. A satellite found Gamma rays of enormous magnitude, at exactly 
the same time another detector in space with better resolution found a weak 
X ray source. The Hubble telescope was quickly turned to the spot and at the 
very limits of its sensitivity found a extremely faint optical dot in a 
Galaxy several billion light years away, 2 days later the dot was gone. 
It's incredible, this sucker was big, for the Gamma rays to be as bright as 
they were this far away, it  must have been HUGE. I wouldn't want to be in 
the same Galaxy with a Gamma ray source of that intensity, even if it only 
lasted a minute. 

When matter and antimatter annihilate each other the photons of the gamma rays  
produced have a specific amount of energy, the antimatter beam recently 
discovered in our Galaxy was discovered by Gamma rays made by anti electrons 
and electrons, in fact anti electrons is the only antimatter ever found in 
quantity outside the lab. The Gamma Ray Bursters don't fit the energy profile 
for electrons or any other known particle. These things make a supernova look 
like a cherry bomb, but what they are I have absolutely no idea. It's spooky.

I highly recommend Host, by Peter James. AI, cryonics, and such a
well-paced and plotted story that it's *very* hard to put it down to do
anything else.

Also lots of fun: The Truth Machine by (Extropy Institute member) James L.
Halperin. His new immortalist book -- The First Immortal -- should be out
soon.

Poul Anderson's Harvest of Stars, and The Stars Are Also Fire, have been
recommended to me, though I haven't read them. I was told they are better
written and have more extropic stuff than his usual fare.

Also coming up:

   Vernor Vinge's latest, probably titled A Deepness in the Sky.

   Bart Kosko's first novel -- Nanotime -- will be out very soon.

Max

I just read "The Probability Broach" (finished it Tuesday) and I can say it
is the one of the best sf books I have read recently.  It is the best book
I have ever read in the alternative history genre.
The case it makes for anarcho-capitalism is relatively weak because Smith
uses advanced technology to get around the hard problems we face.  The
arguement against gun control is considerably better.  It is definitely
worth reading.

Wow, I'm surprised this didn't make it to the news.  There's been discussion
over whether GRB are local or extragalatic events (extragalatic having had
the preference) and this seems pretty good proof that they are extragalactic
and really big and nasty too.  It's been suspected that they were collapsing
binary neutron stars or something like that and this is evidence to back that
up.  I don't want to trivialize what's on the news, but the existence of true
monsters like that is big news.

Just think - there could be one about to happen right next door and we
wouldn't even know ...

I have recently learned that by checking the home pages of some book
publishers, you can find out their (predicted) schedule for upcoming
books.  I always hear about upcoming movies but with books it seems like
a surprise when I walk into the store.  Is there a more centralized
source for this kind of information?

Speaking of GRBs, does anyone think the phenomenon could be something created
by advanced civilizations for the purpose of energy uses, or something like
that?  Or, am I just in Star Trek land?  I have thought for some time that if
the universe is controlled by advanced individuals, then it could be possible
that many seemingly "natural" events could actually be done by such
individuals.  What's the verdict?

Statistics are the best way to describe reality the way it is.
Everything else is just opinion.

As always, there's a bright side: all patents are public, so while
you can't legally make profit from the patent, you can always build
the device for your own use.  I wonder if developing and publishing
a GNU design from such a patent would be punishable by law...

Also, this tactic essentially means giving the technology away to
about half of all the world's countries: the ones that don't enforce
or care about patent laws.  You're going to go after that
government-backed company in China that's making money off your
patent?  Yeah, right.  Ask Microsoft for advice. :)

Whatever they are, they are not matter. Or far far away. Nothing material 
(save of a hot plasma cloud) could survive near such an event. Pocket 
quasars. Could events of such energy densities (how dense?) be useful for 
spacetime engineering, the most obvious solution to the Great Silence in 
the Skies mystery?

WHile the current images being received are in fact 13,000 years old,
based on the distance in light years, there is no reason why this
phenomenon cannot be continuing where it is, or a new one may be forming
elsewhere. The antimatter in the jet is a product of extremely violent
collisions and or explosions that you could not get within a few hundred
light years of without being fried by the radiation density. The product
of the matter antimatter interactions at the edges of the jet is
extremely high energy gamma radiation... Better to make antimatter your
self and keep it in a bottle (magnetic bottle).

If you build something covered by copyright, whether for yourself or
someone else, I suspect that you are still breaking copyright. The idea of
copyright is to protect the financial rewards from a certain idea. If you
build it yourself rather than buy it you are taking away money from the
legal owner of the invention (of course the logic is twisted if the
copyright owner is just sitting on the patent, but I don't think this
changes anything legally). Otherwise it would be OK for a group of people
with mutual interest to form, then make and distribute a copyrighted
invention in a non-profit manner. The size of the group could be same size
as the market for the original invention. Even if there is a loophole in
the law that allows this to happen I doubt that it would last very long
once it was exploited.

Thanks to all of you for your SF suggestions.

I've read "The Illuminatus! Trilogy" by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson.
It's really wild and funny; I didn't think to mention it, cuz, as you said,
it's not totally sci-fi. I've also read "Prometheus Rising" by R.A.W., which
is sorta nonfiction and might be of interest to extropians, being
futuristic, forward-thinking, and optimistic.

I had heard that "The Diamond Age" wasn't all that good, even tho' the topic
sounds interesting: nanotech, right?

I loved Diamond Age. It has quite a few fairytale references subtly strewn about, but it's still pretty close to hard SF.


I wish I'd written it.

Who knows? it's probably just a natural phenomena of some sort, but I must 
admit when I first heard of it I thought of Robin Hanson's essay "The Great 
Filter". This is almost certainly bullshit, but suppose, just suppose nature 
was unkind, suppose in the technological history of any civilization there 
will come a time when it will find hints of a new force in nature, and suppose 
there was a very obvious experiment to investigate this possibility, and 
suppose they had not one scrap of information to think it was in any way 
dangerous. And then BOOM.

It is of course difficult to predict how a newly discovered force in Physics 
will react, that's why it's new. Madam Curie was certainly not stupid, and 
she had not one scrap of information to think that the strange rays given off 
by Radium were in any way dangerous, but it killed her.

If the Gamma Ray Bursters are the product of intelligence, it looks more like 
a horrible miscalculation than a energy project to me. I very much doubt that 
the signature of an advanced civilization would be anything super hot like 
Gamma Rays, because that would be very inefficient. I think that waste heat
would probably be in the infra red, just a little above the 3 degree 
background black body radiation.

	I also recommend "Quantum Psychology" by R.A.W, which is
	written to be read with a group, and contains group
	exercises.  As with "Prometheus" (which also contains
	exercises, so it is more of a "self help" book than
	a series of essays) it explores intelligence increase,
	reality construction and other matters which I have
	encountered here on the list.  Like everything else
	R.A.W. has written, it is witty and doesn't take itself
	too seriously.

Avon's sf web page is

http://avonbooks.com/avon/sf.html

and this month has a nice piece by Sherry Tepper on women and change.
(They ran a piece by me on cloning in March, but I think that's now
inaccessible.  Had a nice picture of identity-masked sheep...)

They list a new Rudy Rucker novel, FREEWARE.  Presumably third in his live
robots sequence.  Good news!

Subject: [MURG]: Wow! Watching synapses fire!

Science magazine today (276:547) printed a blurb on a paper in Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences (U.S.A.) (*) on some really important
work.  Researchers have conjugated luciferase (a chemical which glows when
it joins up with luciferin) to synaptotagmin, a protein found in synaptic
vescicles.  The result is that they can now image individual synapses
firing, over a wide area and in real time.  This is going to be a VERY
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ (emph. by 'gene)
important technique; when you can monitor all the natural inputs (via this
technique) and simultaneously monitor the output (via an electrode or
several other methods), you can characterize the computational properties
of the neuron under natural circumstances.

I think the neuron will be completely understood by the end of the
millenium.  Now all we have to do is develop techniques for digitizing
them...

I enjoyed DA (I'll try to use E-prime; books "are" not good or bad, people
like them or not), but it has some flaws (like the hurried ending). It is
actually an unusually detailled description of a nanotechnological
society, with plenty of ideas of new forms of human organisation.

I received the following questions from Annette Ware, a 
soon-to-be-graduated student at Mount Vernon College in Washington, D.C.  
I will be sending her my own answers, but she agreed with me that it 
would be a good idea for me to post this to the list so that she can get 
a broader range of opinion.

Please address your replies to her at aware@nicom.com, but note that 
because she is graduating, she will not be using this address after May 
11th.

Thanks.

According to a news story in the April 25 Science [276:529-530] there is
now some debate as to the source of the GRBs.  The initial analysis of the
Hubble data 26 and 38 days after the burst confirmed the reported fading
point source. However, Caraveo, et al of the IFC in Milan analyzed the
data separately using what they claim to be "superior software" and
concluded that the apparent source was moving across the sky.  Based on
their analysis, the object may be only a few hundred lightyears away,
closer than even the galactic source proponents had previously imagined.
They could be seeing "anything from a transient cloud of gas associated
with the burst to a background galaxy, aligned by chance with the
pointlike object."  Astronomers hope to resolve this in a few months when
the point source emerges from behind the glow of the sun - if it's still
visible. 

In a related story, the recent claim of a cosmic axis by researchers at
Rochester and Kansas has been met with considerable skepticism.  They
supposedly used old data, ignoring 99% of recent radio galaxy observations
and their conclusions are based on an outdated theory of radio wave
polarization.  The two researchers are still confident that future
studies will support their theory.

I concur. Outside of waste heat and carbon dioxide, at least on this
planet, it is a recognised pattern that as a society becomes more
advanced economically and technologically past the early industrial
stage, the per capita amount of waste and pollution produced goes down.
The turnaround point is somewhere around a per capital income level of
$8,000.00 per year. Once you get to that point as a nation, your average
personal pollution goes down.

Extrapolating this, considering that gamma rays are about the nastiest
form of pollution one could produce, I highly doubt that a highly
advanced civilization would be party to widespread pollution of parsecs
of space by gamma ray bursts.

Danny,
I'm not sure how much experience you have on the web, but I highly
recommend that you check out these two search engines. Using the proper
methods, you can use them to find info on the web on just about
anything. If you are using Netscape as a browser, make a book mark to
each of these, and place them at the top of your bookmark list. If you
are using Explorer, put them at the top of your "favorite places" list.
Then whenever you need to find information on something, you can browse
right to the search engines and start finding things for yourself.

http://www.altavista.digital.com
http://www.hotbot.com

Of course many people who are not experienced in using search engines
like these, or Excite, Inforseek, Yahoo, etc... have trouble because
they do not know the "code words" in using them effectively. TYpically
if you just type in several key words, the engine will come back with
tens of thousands of pages that all have at least one of the words you
typed in. This is obviously annoying. However, if you put a plus sign
(+) before each word, the engine will ony find pages that have every
word with a plus sign before them. Also, if you want an exact phrase,
put quotes around  a whole phrase, so that it will find that phrase
specifically. Narrowing down your search is simply a matter of adding
more discriminating words and phrases.

A copyright cannot be applied to any material object, save things like
buildings, sculptures, and other things, merely for their form as an
object of art. TO be patented, something must have a demonstrated
usefull function that is new and unique, or that performs the function
in a new and unique way. By definition, art work has no functional
utility aside from its form and thus cannot be patented. However a
method of creating art that is new and unique CAN be patented. it is
very important that you understand the differences between types of
intellectual property like copyrights, patents, and trademarks. Each
functions and is treated differently in a legal context.

Once again, you are confusing copyrights and patents. However, any
intellectual property can be recreated by an individual for individual
use only. If the individual gains commercially in any way it is a
violation of the creators property rights. THis is why software licenses
allow business users of software who are the users of that copy more
than 80% of the time to copy the software onto their personal computer
at home. Exceptions to this are software that could only be used for
business purposes, like marketing management software, business
management software like Microsoft Profit, engineering software, etc.

Distribution to others is not allowed and does not fit into the context
of "personal use". Law does not mandate that you make a profit to
qualify as a commercial enterprise. If people are reimbursing you for
the cost of reproduction, then they are helping to defray the initial
cost to purchase the book, tape, disk, patent file, or painting. THis
reimbursement is a recognised commerical gain. Every individual must
purchase at least one piece of intellectual property, even just a copy
of the patent file at the patent office. In the case of a patent, the
person is not buying the actual product, but merely a relatively simple
description of the product. It is still up to them to create engineering
drawings, production drawings, tooling drawings, the production tooling,
etc to build copys, and in that event can still only make as many as
they can personally use.

I strongly suggest building a friendship with the person who actually 
orders the science fiction books for your favorite bookstore.  That 
person is usually a source of knowledge and opinion on what is 
being published, and will usually enjoy the opportunity to share it.  
While many magazines will publish lists or previews of upcoming books 
from major authors, what gets in there often depends on who has a 
good press agent.  I myself tend to be a bit cynical about the 
publishing biz, but it's hard to maintain that when someone I 
consider a friend waxes eloquent about the latest Gibson coming 
out this year (yes, a new book on the way).  Enthusiasm is 
contagious, and I'm keeping a book file of all the recommendations 
from this thread (and don't forget Sarah's web site book 
recommendation list).

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

I can't talk for Extropians, but I can talk for myself. And I know that
economy and free markets is what makes those people poor. Liberating
markets even more would replace one system of injustice with another one
much worse.

        Come now, Erik.  First of all, I must comment that you are speaking
on the extropian list about a fundamental list ideal...a general faux pas.
You are most certainly entitled to your own beliefs, but the tone in which
you are conveying them appears to be one of condescension.

        Second of all, if you are going to persist in ethical arguments,
please back your posts up with some facts as well as opinion.  As the posts
stand now, they seem to be more ranting and raving about personal thoughts
than fact-based economical arguments.  Please consider what other people
have to say, rather than charging ahead with set ethics.  Most of all, keep
your mind open...no-one likes a cynic.


                                        Kineticize!

I suggest that you start getting legal advice from real lawyers.
Whether or not one makes money is /completely irrelevant/ to IP law.
"Personal use" is no defense to infringement.  "Fair use" is, and there
are precedents for what is and is not fair use, but whether the use is
private or commercial is not a deciding factor (for example, quoting
a small piece of a copyrighted work for review is fair use--whether or
not the review is done for profit).  Patents and copyrights are the
same in this regard.  Building a patented device in your garage for
your own private use /is/ infringement.

Making a Gamma ray burster in your back yard would not be a good idea, but  
what would be a reasonable energy source for an super advanced civilization? 
Solar power may be old fashioned but I still like it. I certainly would not 
recommend building breeder reactors, there is already a glut of plutonium in
the world. All reactors produce plutonium, a big power plant reactor will 
invariable produce many tons of it in its lifetime. A breeder reactor is 
designed to maximize the production of plutonium. I'm not even a great fan of 
conventional reactors, and call me a wimp if you want to, but breeders really  
give me the creeps.

1) A breeder is at a much higher energy density than a regular reactor and      
   that means it's inherently more dangerous.

2) A conventional reactor uses Uranium as fuel in which the U235 has been    
   enriched from the naturally occurring .7% concentration to about 4%,    
   you need about 85% to make a bomb.  A breeder uses weapons grade plutonium    
   as a fuel, and lots of it.

3) A conventional reactor uses water as a coolant and to slow down the  
   neutrons, a breeder uses molten sodium that burns in the air and explodes    
   in the presents of water. After a short time in operation this hot liquid    
   sodium becomes intensely radioactive. Just last year a leak in a sodium 
   pump destroyed the newest and largest breeder reactor in Japan,  if it
   wasn't in a containment building it could have been a human disaster.    
   It's already an economic disaster of several hundred million dollars.

The thing I really don't like about fission reactors is that they produce all  
that damn plutonium. There is so much of it in existence, thousands of tons,  
that it's very hard to keep track of it all. You only need slightly over  
9 pounds to make a crude nuclear bomb, less if you're clever.

There is another type of Nuclear power, but there are 2 things I don't like   
about fusion reactors. 

1) They don't exist, yet. 

2) Most reactions would make things near the reactor radioactive because they    
   produce high speed neutrons.  
         
The fusion reaction I like best is between non radioactive deuterium 
(Hydrogen 2) and non radioactive Helium 3, this produces non radioactive   
Helium 4, an easily controlled proton, 18.3 mev of energy, and most important 
of all, no neutron. Unfortunately you need a higher temperature to achieve it  
than the deuterium tritium reaction most are talking about.

There is a type of cold fusion that definitely works, even as cold as 13 
degrees Kelvin but, as Eugene mentioned recently, there hasn't been much 
happening in muon-catalyzed cold fusion lately, and it's a shame because the 
idea seems so elegant. A negative muon is almost identical to an electron
except it's 207 times as massive, you can even substitute them for electrons 
in Hydrogen and the result is atoms and molecules 207 times smaller than 
normal. In all fusion reactions you need to get the nucleus of 2 atoms so 
close that the short range nuclear forces can take over, this is not easy to 
do because the nucleus of both atoms have a positive charge and so repel each
other. In normal fusion you use brute force to do this, things get very hot 
and so the two slam together, if you use muons instead of electrons in a 
hydrogen molecule the two nuclei are already 207 times closer together even 
when ice cold.

There are problems of course, it takes energy to make a muon, to break even 
each muon would have to catalyze between 100 and 500 fusion reactions, and 
muons are not stable, their half life is 2*10^-6 seconds, but a lot can happen
in two microseconds, that's a very long time by particle physics standards. 
I know of no fundamental reason it couldn't be made to work.

I am willing to concede that you are certain that freedom makes people 
unhappy and that communism is the key to prosperity, but I will not concede 
that you "know" it. Certainty is cheap, people are running around absolutely 
certain about all sorts of damn fool things, but knowledge is much more

John K Clark <johnkc@well.com> described some of the problems with fast
breeders, but missed my pet peeve: the time constant is milliseconds (vs.
minutes or hours for more sensible reactors). That's about enough time for
the control system to tell the operator, "oops." As fond as I am of nuclear
power, I wouldn't want to live downwind of a fast breeder. It does not rely
on a moderator in the same way as a enriched uranium/water (American), or
natural uranium/heavy water (Canadian) reactor: instead of slowing down the
neutrons to meet a resonance point in the nucleus of the fuel, they let the
neutrons slam into the fuel at full power which is the process atomic bombs
use. Whereas a North American reactor can't explode like an atomic bomb,
fast breeders can as I understand it.

Of course it doesn't take a fast breeder to make plutonium. India got its
atomic bomb from a Canadian reactor. Inefficient, but it worked.

Erik:

Some facts are so simple and obvious that somehow they get 
overlooked.

Free markets and economies don't make poor children.  Parents do.

If you'd like to educate the future parents in these economies so that
they don't make even *more* poor children, you might consider
designing some educational materials designed specifically for the
villages you have in mind.

Then, when Teledesic goes on line, set up a school in the third-world
village of your choice.  Then, instead of experiencing all this
frustration and heartache from afar, you'll be able to make a direct
contribution.

As you learn the language and lessons, keep an on-line journal on the
web.  If you find your experience to be rewarding, perhaps your
strategies can be replicated by others that have similar goals.

Who knows, maybe all the armchair saviors will play the third-world
like a video game, providing enlightenment and relief with all the
pinpoint accuracy of smart bombs and cruise missiles.

(You've probably already looked at it, but just in case, see 
www.teledesic.com - start planning and organizing now, and in 5 years
perhaps you'll be ready launch your humanitarian campaign.  P.S., I
too have been programmed with values that encourage pro-social
efforts.  The Extropians simply insist that you not FINANCE these
efforts by involuntary taxation.  Do what you need to do, just make
sure you raise your money in a way that is entirely voluntary.)

Sorry, Mike, but I think there are several weak points in your analysis. 
For one, I consider excluding carbon dioxide a sleight of hand. We haven't
even begun our first steps towards a zero overall CO_2 release energy
economy (i.e. photovoltaics, hydrogen, and methanol from
biomass/carbonates). That exponentially rising atmospheric greenhouse gas
content is a gamble, is not open to doubt. Antarctic palaeoice samples
show our climate to be intrinsically nonlinear, and we are giving it major
shove. How's that for a global experiment.  Globally stupid. 

Earlier sources of pollution, starting with medieval metallurgy, were
intense, but localized. As local wood, ore, and energy sources were
depleted, we started to forage overseas. Now we are the heart of the
furnace, the focus of material streams converging from all around the
globe. At the origin, in the underdeveloped countries, there is zero
environment protection, the wages are very low so only a tiny fraction of
the cake remains there. We are skimming the cream off the global milk
bowl, in more than one aspect. 

This effect is only sustainable, as long there is milk in the bowl, and
the world is not equilibrated, underdeveloped world patches ready to take
the olympic fire of industrialization still exist. But both the patches
are running out, and the milk is progresively turning sour by the
equilibration metabolites. A 1 GPeople to join the happy-select-few-throng
will produce a _lot_ of metabolites. Sustainability of progress?

I say: let's turn our eyes to sky. The Mother of all Milkbowls: Galactica.
Let's move industrialization into orbital factories, us following on the 
heel. Autoreplicating systems are cheap, and there are lots of 
unequilibrated matter/energy patches out there.   Let's.

Subject: NEAP Status 05/03/97

Greetings,

The Near Earth Asteroid Prospector venture is coming along nicely.

I have created this distribution list of over one hundred people who
have expressed an interest in being kept informed about progress, or
people who I think are interested.

I intend to mail to this list only occasionally, so being on this list
will not be a burden to you. If you wish to be removed, please just
email me, and I will be happy to comply. If you receive two copies, it
is because you are also on the space-investor list -- let me know and
I will remove the duplicate.

NEAP summary: 

NEAP will be the first private spacecraft to leave earth orbit, the
first private spacecraft to visit another planetary body, and the
first private spacecraft to land on another planetary body. NEAP will
carry sufficient instrumentation to size and categorize the asteroid,
thereby allowing us to calculate a "street value" for it. After
landing, we will "stake" any mining and patent claims we believe to be
possible, and then will simply declare ownership of the trillion
dollar asset. This will help draw attention to the need to establish
private property rights in space. Nine sources of income from NEAP
have been identified, two of which could each pay for the entire
venture. The entire venture will be privately financed, with no
government grant money of any kind (necessary to ensure a pure private
claim of the asteroid and its resources).

STATUS report:

At this time, there are three university groups working on various
aspects of NEAP design. The universities involved are UCSD, NM State,
and U TX at Austin. Many of the approximately thirty students are
mentored with senior scientists and engineers, and have been working
on their assignments since early this year. The effort is headed by
Dr. Jim Arnold, founder of the UCSD campus, and Director of the eight
campus California Space Institute, and a NEAP advisor.

I will be at UCSD / CalSpace all day on May 4 and 5 to receive study
results on the following areas: mission design options, spacecraft
design options, communications options and trajectory calculations for
all potential near earth object targets. After the two day meeting,
the three groups will continue to refine their analyses, in accordance
with my technical feedback.

I have spoken with Lockheed-Martin and MacDonnell Douglas about
launch plans. One promising possibility is LM, which may be able to
offer us a primary payload slot, with a low earth satellite as a
secondary payload, thereby cutting our launch cost in half. LM is also
interested in a creative proposal from me on how to finance the launch
-- talks are ongoing. We have discussed joint venture types of deals
with two startup launch vendors, and have as an advisor, the former
head of the Russian space program, which resulted in a very
attractively priced offer. Planned launch date is 2000 or 2001.

Overall venture cost estimates have declined from over $80 million to
less than $40 million. It is expected that the cost will continue to
decline, but less rapidly.

I will be in Princeton at the Space Studies Institute conference May 8
through 11. The conference is chaired by one of our advisors, Dr. John
Lewis. I spent a half day with John at his home about a week ago, just
before I attended Henry Vanderbilt's excellent Space Access conference
in Scottsdale. John will introduce me to the SSI conference attendees,
and I will spend most of the conference identifying good people.

I will then go on to Washington, DC where I have some very "high
level" meetings concerning NEAP. After two days of meetings, I will
return to my home in Colorado to incorporate the CalSpace study
results into the NEAP business plan. I will spend two days with my
corporate finance attorney on May 19 and 20, in preparation of formal
capital formation, which I intend to start during June.

I will give two talks at the International Space Development
Conference (NSS/ISDC) in Orlando, May 22 to 26. The topics will be on
the economics of space resource development and on space exploration.
The talks will be Saturday and Sunday, May 24 and 25.

On June 9 I will address the annual Astronautics States Association in
Washington, DC and will use that opportunity to introduce NEAP to
them. The ASA could be helpful in getting me in touch with local and
regional space business roundtables, political contributors (possible
sources of capital), and other potentially valuable contacts.

On June 10, I will address the 190th annual meeting of the American
Astronomical Society in Winston-Salem. I will use that opportunity to
introduce the "Benson Prize for the Amateur Discovery of Near Earth
Asteroids." This is a cash prize of $500 for each of the next ten
amateur discoveries. Sky & Telescope magazine will assist in spreading
the word about the Benson Prize through a magazine article, and a
Benson Prize page at their web site. It is intended that this Prize
will increase the name recognition of Space Development LLC, myself
and NEAP. In addition, it should stimulate the discovery of more
potential NEAP targets.

The SpaceDev advisory board has grown to include a "Who's Who" list of
eighteen scientists and engineers.

NEEDED:

I believe that most aspects of NEAP are coming along very well. Two
ares where I can use some help:

1) contacts in mining, big construction, natural resources and energy
companies -- these will be very important for a variety of reasons
including funding, joint venture possibilities, political support for
private property rights in space, etc.

2) Money. I will be investing a significant amount of my own money in
this venture, and in June will begin formal fund raising through the
sale of equity in the company. While I have some good leads, I can
never have too many. You may be surprised about the kinds of contacts
you may have, even indirect contacts to wealthy people through
friends, relatives and associates.

I will appreciate and remember any help.

NEXT report:

I intend to distribute another progress report around mid-June.

Many people have said that NEAP will excite the public with its bold
mission to another planetary body, making its claims, and showing the
general public that they can be involved in space activities, NOW.

I will find all possible ways to leverage NEAP into a position
to help create cheap access to space, to help other entrepreneurial
companies, and in general to rekindle the public interest and hope in
going to space in their lifetimes.

I am open to any suggestions you may have, on any aspect of this
venture.

routing in the low transcend

Risking Anders' axe-swinging berserkergang, I hazard to
(briefly) venture into his private domain: Jupiter Brains.
(Since my current shell account at the Leibniz-local Sun
cluster can only lynx, AmiTCP is still not installed, and
I don't like imposing large binaries/high-overhead
applications on a decade-old hardware with just 7-odd MHZ,
7 MB RAM, no virtual memory and a 120 MByte SCSI drive, and
the new 64 MByte/K6/Chaintech/Matrox Millenium/L4 Linux box
is getting delayed, and delayed and delayed, I never can
browse on the great Aleph server too much) </apology>. So:

How much bang can we squeeze from _conventional_ lunatic fringe
tech -- no spacetime engineering, no femtotechnology -- plain
old-fashioned stellar-scale autoreplicating molecular circuitry
clusters, lazily swinging themselves around their own gravity
centers, or solar-sailing fleet of line-of-sight laser-linked
hardware boxes, on light-minute wide (lest their circuitry fry
to black crisp in solproximal infernal heat) stellar orbits?

We already know the outer limits of it, as defined by the
Bekenstein bound. Actual constraints are much more pronounced,
however. Using excited states of organic molecules for doing
logics, obviously limits switching speeds to bond dissotiation
energies (twirling dipoles emit/absorb EM radiation, and
electron density is changed at excitation, geometry as well).
Much lower, even, since thermal vibration will destroy the
circuitry (I think defect introduction rate vs. temperature
will be markedly nonlinear, showing a catastrophic threshold
at few hundred K), and operating many switches at high
frequencies at extremely high integration densities achievable
by three-dimensional macromolecular crystals (I don't think
the respite, if any, granted by reversible logics will amount
to much), will dissipate a lot of heat.

Best implementation for these would be fractal cooling fluid
channels with integrated pumps, in a solid diamond matrix,
encasing, and containing the hyperactively wiggly molecular
switches. Notice that by engineering excited state species -
containing cavities we can control their lifetimes, energy
level spacing, and, most importantly, relaxation trajectories.
However, I am still unsure whether drextech (aka machine-phase
chemistry) is actually viable outside of post-cyberpunk SF
novels, in the real world.

Now autoassembly of linear polymers - macromolecular cluster
complexes, initially going through a solvated, wet stage,
automagically crosslinking to dry, relatively rigid macroscopic
circuitry crystals, instantly inflates the atomic cell edge by
at least one of order of magnitude, dropping integration density
by three. Due to matrix bloating, necessary for kinetical fold
guidance (as we lack the machine-phase reactive-moiety Gatling
guns), and a large density of (mated, in the assembled cell)
complementary surfaces essential in the hierarchical autoassembly
process, structures will be much coarser, and since the crosslink
concentration must be low, mechanical properties drastically
worse than that of a diamodoid solid. Isotopically pure CVD
diamond wafers are the best heat conductors known to man (people
like to slice ice cubes with them for a demo, using merely the
heat of your fingers), while linear polymers, even if dry and
crosslinked, do not conduct at all well, nor would they withstand
much higher operation temperatures than 400 K, or so, before
denaturating irreversibly, while diamondoid matrix might survive
at up to 800 K for prolonged periods of time.

(It is interesting to speculate, whether low-K temperature range
quantum dot (not qubits) arrays can achieve radically new kind of
high-density, high-speed, low-power-dissipation computational
devices, but here I am entirely out of my depth. Likewise in
solid-state qubit devices (which I deem unusable, but then that's
just meek me). Resident physicists please step forth to enlighten
us).

Anyway, the maximal concentration of circuitry in the embedding
matrix, and the limiting amount of dissipated power per volume,
as signal travel delay threshold for a given propagating distance,
(as imposed upon us by that pretty unpopular piece of relativistic
physics), seem to imply there are indeed tight limits to bit
integration density and their kinetics both, even though I am
currently somewhat at loss of giving even ballpark figures.

I guess, that without resorting to yet hypothetical machine-phase
chemistry, one could implement a molecular CAM with an elementary
cell with a 0.1-1 um edge (this gives us a integration density
uncertainty bandwidth of merely three orders of magnitude), and
absolute upper limits to switching speed of roughly 10^14, or
10 THz (visible light photons, of roughly 0.4-0.8 um wavelength
(at least the green/blue ones), bear enough energy to lyse bonds
en masse, obviously a strong no-no in a computer, even a
fault-tolerat one, since defect rate must remain below a
certain threshold to be able to operate the circuitry for a
sufficient time span for it to be useful, before it has to be
replaced by a freshly synthesized module).

As EM radiation in vacuum (in matter significantly slower, the
slower the higher the refractive index and vice versa) travels
roughly 30 cm in 1 ns (1 GHz clock, coming soon to a desktop near
you, e.g. as Merced, though I'd rather like a PIM (processor-in-
memory design) instead), 0.3 mm (300 um) in 1 ps (1 THz clock,
which is unattainable with semiconductor technology), and 0.3 um
(300 nm) in 0.1 fs (1 pHz clock), whereas EM of 1 um wavelength
(still NIR) has a frequency of about 3*10^14 Hz, or theoretical
maximal switching time in fs range, we have discovered our outer
limits at the individual molecular switch model (please notice
that we have not adressed the very thorny issue of maximal switch
concentration yet, which is a function of both the assembly
process, and cooling system efficiency). We know that the
transfer of energy by direct electromagnetic interaction between
chlorophylls is considered to be pretty rapid, while happening
in 10^12 s (ps) range.

Hence it seems to be realistic to assume maximal switching speeds
achievable with physical structures to lie somewhere in the ps..fs
range, 1 THz - 1 pHz, the lower bound to be more probable. Perhaps
my earlier mentioning of "clock" was somewhat misleading: it is
quite clear that, due to relavistic constraints, assuming
synchronized action by a global clock appear unfeasible. Rather,
a system of locally-coupled, externally pumped oscillators, where
synchronization emerges at a higher operational plain appears more
feasible.

Personally, I like laser pumping, where a system of dyes funnels
the energy into an orthogonal 1d metal grid, crisscrossing the
crystal, and acting as a transient energy storage (as photon
absorption is a stochastic event, we cannot count on cell-local
dye assembly to provide cell-local juice at any time) system,
which then feeds the individual cells. A pulsed operation can
be envisioned, with each pulse pumping up the energy cache, until
it discharges spontaneously, or triggered by a second laser pulse.
If we assume 1 ps for 1 um CAM cell switching time, we can expect
a information light cone propagation velocity of roughly 2 um/1 ps,
or 2 Mm/s, almost 1% of c.

(Anyway, as we now have arrived at the very heart of Never-Never
Land, and I am notorious for goofing up my math this numbers should
be taken cum grano salis. If your bogosity detector notices a
supercritical bozon flux, please let the list know).

Let us leap up to the next integration level: energy dissipation
will impose a tight limit onto volume/surface ratio. Whereas
diamondoid systems can directly radiate power into few-K space,
molecular CAMs must be fluid-cooled. I guess one could engineer
proteins the resulting crystals to feature orthogonally aligned
mesopores/channels for the cooling fluid to seep through
(this opens the opportunity for chemical energy pumping), but
this will make the crystal much more brittle, and further dilute
the circuitry concentration.

On the module cluster level, we have a mechanical gravitation/
tidal/resonance problem. If we assume the computational nodes to
be mounted on a stiff truss structure, sooner or later tidal
forces, own gravity, and vibration resonance (a problem already
plaguing today's satellite photovoltaics arrays).

So sooner, or later, we must resort to freely orbiting computational
nodes. If we consider them to be orbiting around their own center of
gravity, orbit perturbations both require the need for active position
control, and limit the maximal module/space voxel. Since their
relative velocities might be considerable, collisions may trigger
release of debris, the so-called fragmentation catastrophe. The need
for active position control requires reactive mass, which must be
sometimes replenished. If solar sails are utilized, this will
dilute the circuitry even further. All in all, a nontrivial
multidimensional optimization problem, as the optimal grain
size of each hierarchy must be chosen.

Furthermore, it is instrumental to realize, that gravitation tends
to create circular, wrap-around structures. Whether nodes on a
planetary surface, nodes orbiting around their common gravity
center, or a star, the node grid is subtly distorted, with node
neighbourhood relation in constant flux. If we assume geodesic
(a quite inappropriate term for an orbiting node cluster) routing
scheme, where a data packet emerged somewhere deep within the
individual molecular circuitry piece has to worm its way towards
surface, being beamed node along node, unless finding the right
node, the right target metaCAM subcell, we must assume each node
to bear an identity which is not a function of relative position.
Instead, node IDs could be derived from a global position,
requiring beakon nodes. As node orbits are deterministic on
the short (a few revolutions) run, perhaps this information
can be used.

As mankind's machines are going to spin off into interplanetary
space, we need a GPS++, which is also handy for node ID derivation.
The natural coordinate system for the solar system seems to be
obviously a heliocentric one.

This is a more plausible story regarding mistakes make before the
stage where we are now: able to see these booms out there and soon to
figure out what causes them.  Even then, I find it hard to see how
this could explain more than about 10^3 out of a filter of > 10^20.
And given the high rate at which we see bursters out there now the
filter past this point must be very large.  This theory, if true,
would be very bad news, even assuming we could avoid the BOOM ourselves.

Here's an idea of a use of GRB's by intelligent species:

Lets say some society irresponsibly produces Berserker type Von Neumann
machines as space probes, that within several hundred or thousand years
become the bane of some star cluster. Intelligent species might bury
themselves deep into their planetary crust, then send out a mission to
purposely set off some sort of stellar reaction that creates a GRB. The
GRB acts as an exterminator to wipe out all those Berserkers that have
overrun local space and are munching on peoples planets. Once the
pestilence is dead or higly minimized, people dig out and rebuild.

Not to mention that he is wholly inaccurate. While the differential
between our richest citizens and poorest citizens is larger than
anywhere else, we still have the richest poor people in the world (save
countries like Luxembourg and Kuwait that have no poor citizens, the
poor ones are non citizens). How many nations count a TV, VCR, and
automobile as part of a poverty level existence?

If you think its just my American bias, listen to Stalin's grandson who
is on record as saying: "In my country, we struggle to make everyone
equally poor, while in your country, you struggle to make everyone
equally rich." That is the essential difference between socialist and
free market economies.

A bit inaccurate. A breeder can be set to produce excess plutonium,
produce no excess, or to burn up excess plutonium. This is why there
have been proposals to restart the Hanford breeder as a means of helping
Russia and Byellorus (sp?) dispose of their weapons grade plutonium.
most people automatically get the creeps from the name Breeder because
it brings up images of all those 50's nuclear monster movies.

No it just means it produces more energy per pound of reactor than a
light water reactor. If you use that as a measure of danger, since solar
panels have a energy desity ten times higher than a breeder reactor, is
solar power ten times more dangerous? I didn't think so.

it uses plutonium at an enrichment level of about 40%, half that of

Thats why they make containment buildings. Funny though, people don't
realize that the ash emitted by coal plants has highly radioactive
isotopes in it, as well as the fly ash that coal plants sell to contrete
plants to make concrete with. One coal plant puts out more radioactivity
into the environment every year than all the nuclear plants in the
country combined.

Getting the plutonium is one thing, but knowing how to build a bomb that
will actually explode using only  9 pounds is another level of
accomplishment entirely. BUilding a bomb of the simplicity of the
Nagasaki weapon requires a minimum of 35 pounds of plutonium, as well as
requiring the use of 48 Klystron switches, which are even more highly
controlled items than plutonium itself.

True this is the most elegant solution, but getting a commercially
viable supply of Helium III will require that we set up a mining colony
on the moon, though I'm not sure but wouldn't a breeder reactor be ideal
for making Helium III?

Much worse?

Joy.

About 120 years ago, India and Japan were both profoundly poor
countries with extraordinarily underdeveloped agrarian economies. One
of those countries chose socialism. One chose the free market. Can you
guess which was which?

About 50 years ago, on the Korean peninsula, a controlled experiment
was done. A uniformly shattered economy was divided in two. Half the
country got a largely capitalist free market economy. Half got a
Maoist local version of communisim called "Juche". Which half is now
starving?

Around the world, pure idiots think that they know "better" than the
market, that they can redirect resources better than a pareto optimal
free exchange of goods between free people could. Over and over again,
the experiment is done, the people suffer, but the idiots, being pure
in their lack of mentation, never seem to draw the obvious conclusion
the facts lead to -- which is that the freer the economy, the
wealthier the people -- even the poorest 10% of the U.S. population
look rich compared to the average North Korean, the average Albanian
or the average Cuban.

Mr. Moeller claims to "know that economy and free markets is what
makes those people poor". Well, I'm sure thats what he thinks, but
then again, I know of lots of people who believe in Alien abductions,
pyramid power, psychic surgery and telekinesis. What he "knows" just
isn't so, and hasn't even the slightest crumb of evidence holding it
up.

What disturbs me more, though, is that anyone would post anything like
that to the Extropians mailing list. Why would anyone *want* to be on
this discussion list if they thought that human freedom wasn't one of
their highest ideals?

Didn't say what I meant to: that as far as *analyzing* evolution of facts
and values, you'll be lead into finding that the value (in hypothesized
beings) that is identical to what you (the analyzer) call success, will
be the one with the most stability, and everything else might as well be
coded (in your analysis) as ideas of how to achieve it.  The flexibility in
your (the analyzer's) "stance" (as Dennett calls it) sort of leaves you
holding the ball.

I like your division into small and large spaces better, but I think small
spaces only look that way *after* evolution has tromped all over large
areas and found good spots with boundaries.  In more stable areas I
guess the advantages of sex just take longer to show up.  Btw, there's
also the choice (now) of being sometimes-asexual, sometimes-sexual, so
you can mix the advantages of stability and new ideas.

But to combine asex in one area with sex in others, don't you need a
*main* parent?  Hmm, like the evo of ribosomes (inhereted from mother)
vs. nuclei (mixed)...

Then it's not a breeder, just a plutonium reactor.

Making an H bomb would be tricky, but not a simple A bomb, a Physics student 
working on a masters degree and a chemist with a little knowledge of  
explosives could do it, if they had the Plutonium. It's really not that hard, 
in fact in all the thousands of A bomb tests there has not been one dud, 
it's always worked the first time.

A few years ago I had a sort of morbid curiosity about this, I figured if one  
was going to blow me up one day I wanted to know something about them, 
it's amazing what's available. "The Curve of Binding Energy" by John McPhee 
was very useful, so was " The Las Alamos Primer" by Robert Serber and 
"Mushroom"  by John Aristotle Phillips. Also very interesting was a 
thermonuclear weapon maintenance manual, apparently unclassified, that I 
found deep in the stacks of a public library.                         
       

        >it [a breeder] uses plutonium at an enrichment level of about 40%,         
        >half that of weapons grade.
            

If you're using U235 then about 80% enrichment is needed before the bomb is  
practical, but if you're using Plutonium 40% would work fine, you'd need 
11 kilograms of it, at 20% you'd need about 18 kilograms, at 50% you'd need  
just under 10, and at 100% you'd only need 4.4 kilograms. This assumes that  
the implosion is done crudely and the Plutonium is not compressed beyond its  
normal density, this is never true of in modern weapons so they need less 
Plutonium. The critical mass varies inversely with the square of the density  
of the plutonium, but a terrorist might be too dumb to take advantage of this. 
Anyway, enriching plutonium is Far easier than enriching Uranium, plutonium  
is a different element so you can use chemical means.
            

        >BUilding a bomb of the simplicity of the Nagasaki weapon requires a         
        >minimum of 35 pounds of plutonium,   
     

That was over half a century ago, and far from an ideal design, for example,  
the heavy tamper was placed right next to the Plutonium giving it no place  
to build up speed. As Ted Taylor, the Michelangelo of A bomb designers has  
publicly stated, If you want to drive a nail into a board, do you place the 
hammer on the nail and then push?
                     

        >as well as requiring the use of 48 Klystron switches, which are even

Krytrons are used in other things besides bombs, in the oil exploration  
industry for example. The EGG corporation makes them, part number RN22,  
cost 80$.            


        >WHat is a cheap and easy way to make muons?


Aim an ion beam into a target of deuterium or lithium.

I see no evidence to the contrary that there are invisible and otherwise
undetectable leprechauns running around my chair.  Of course, this lack of
knowledge doesn't disturb me all that much.  After all, if something is
undetectable by any means, it is for all practical purposes not there.

I just joined the Science-News list and thought it might be of some
interest to people on this list. The first summary I received seemed to
have several issues of interest to those on this list. If anyone knows the
background of the list I'd be interested.

I've attached this weeks mailout so people can assess it to see whether it
before joining.

NASA ABANDONS MONKEY SPACE EXPERIMENT
Following pressure from animal-rights advocates and their
political allies, NASA has announced it will abandon the Bion
life sciences project undertaken with Russia and France that
tests the effects of weightlessness on monkeys in space. A death
of one of the monkeys in January apparently provoked the review
and decision to eliminate the program.

NADER GROUP CALLS AIDS TRIALS UNETHICAL
Ralph Nader's Public Citizen's Organization has charged that
international AIDS therapy trials in developing countries are
unethical. The basis of the accusation is that patients given
placebos rather than the drug AZT are compromised by not re-
ceiving the most effective treatment for the disease. Health
officials state that on the contrary the studies are ethical
and are vital for international treatment of the AIDS epidemic.
Nader held a press conference on 22 April.

CHINESE SCIENTISTS HAVE SUCCESS PREDICTING EARTHQUAKES
Earthquakes in a region occur either in isolation or in groups.
Chinese seismologists have now reported success in imminent
prediction of earthquakes that occur in a group. Apparently,
during the past several months, hundreds of thousands of people
were evacuated on short notice in the interior of China,
avoiding many deaths that might have resulted from the
magnitude-6 earthquakes in the region. Western seismologists,
who have not yet seen the data of their Chinese colleagues, are
reserved but are not all skeptical.

CATALYTIC COMPONENT OF TELOMERASE APPARENTLY IDENTIFIED
Telomerase, the enzyme that rebuilds chromosome ends after cell
division, and an enzyme that may play a key role in cancer and
aging, has been under intensive investigation in many
laboratories. J. Lingner, et al, of the University of Colorado
(Boulder CO), the Baylor College of Medicine (Houston TX), and
the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (Heidelberg, Germany)
have now isolated and identified a protein subunit of telomerase
which apparently acts as the catalytic component of the enzyme.

NEW CONTROVERSY OVER ORIGIN OF GAMMA RAY BURSTS
Flashes of gamma rays in outer space, called Gamma Ray Bursts,
are mysterious occurrences whose origins are unresolved.
Astronomers differ as to whether GRBs originate close to our
galaxy or billions of light years away. Now conflicting
interpretations of orbiting earth satellite data and data from
the Hubble Space Telescope have made the controversy even
sharper, with one group reporting their analysis of the data
indicates the source of a recent GRB is in movement. Astronomers
are hopeful further data from the Hubble Space Telescope will
resolve the issue.

CLAIM OF A COSMIC AXIS DISPUTED
The recent claim of a discovered asymmetry in the universe by
Noland (University of Rochester) and Ralston (University of
Kansas) has come under fire from physicists and radio
astronomers. No one has detected a fatal error in the
Noland-Ralston calculations, but critics say their analysis used
old data and ignored much of the more recent observations of
signals from radio galaxies. What everyone agrees upon is that
such asymmetry, if it exists, would overturn much of cosmology,
including Einstein's Theory of Relativity. A consensus appears
to be forming that the supposed asymmetry will vanish once
better data are used for analysis.

POSSIBLE FUNCTION FOR BREAST CANCER GENES IDENTIFIED
BRCA1 and BRCA2 are known breast cancer susceptibility genes,
discovered in 1994 and 1995. Allan Bradley (Baylor College of
Medicine, Houston TX) and Paul Hasty (Lexicon Genetics Inc., The
Woodlands TX) have now reported that a protein made by BRCA2
plays a critical role in cell repair of DNA damage. It has been
thought that both cancer genes are somehow involved in tumor
suppression, but it now appears the role of these genes may be
in producing proteins vital for DNA repair and the suppression
of mutations.

NEW VACCINES REPORTED FOR URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS
Urinary tract infections (UTI) occur in 8.5 million women in the
U.S. each year, and in many millions more women elsewhere. The
culprit is usually the bacterium E. Coli. Researchers at
MedImmune, a Maryland research company, and at Washington
University (St. Louis MO) have reported they have developed a
genetically engineered injectable vaccine that prevents UTI in
mice. Human trials of a vaccine delivered via suppository are
already underway at the University of Wisconsin (Madison WI).

SUPPOSED CANCER GENE APPEARS IN DEVELOPMENT
The gene DCC has been previously implicated in colorectal
cancer, its absence used as a marker in such cancers, and the
prevailing idea has been that it is a tumor suppressor gene
whose absence provokes carcinogenesis. Three independent groups
of researchers are now reporting that DCC plays an important
role in the development of the embryonic nervous system, DCC and
related genes producing receptor proteins that interpret
directional signals used by migrating cells or developing
neurons. DCC, therefore, may not be a cancer gene at all, but
merely a tag-along to an actual tumor suppressor gene.

A NOVEL CLASS OF MOLECULAR CRYSTALS
Victoria A. Russell and her colleagues at the University of
Minnesota report the crystal engineering of molecular sandwiches
with adjustable porosity. The arrays are a new class of
molecular crystals based on two-dimensional hydrogen-bond
networks. The adjustable flexibility of the networks will allow
crystal engineers to design arrays specific for particular guest
molecules.

DEVELOPMENT OF A SINGLE-ELECTRON TRANSISTOR MICROSCOPE
M. J. Yoo (Lucent Technologies, Bell Labs., presently at Philips
Labs.) reports the construction and use of a single-electron
transistor scanning microscope capable of mapping static
electric fields and charges with 100-nanometer spatial
resolution and a charge sensitivity of a small fraction of an
electron. The device should be of significance in determining
the detailed architecture of semiconductor surfaces.

NEUROGENESIS OBSERVED IN POSTNATAL SPINAL CORD
Permanent paralysis resulting from spinal cord injuries is due
to the inability of the adult mammalian spinal cord to replace
damaged neurons. Lois J. Kehl and her colleagues at the
University of Minnesota report the presence of neuronal
precursor cells in rat postnatal spinal cord, such cells
retaining the ability to be transformed into functional neurons.
Results are of importance to therapeutic approaches to
restoration of function in humans with spinal cord injuries.

CONTINUOUS IN VITRO EVOLUTION OF CATALYTIC FUNCTION
Martin C. Wright and Gerald F. Joyce (Scripps Research
Institute) have subjected a population of RNA molecules to
repeated rounds of selective amplification and mutation,
specifically 300 selective rounds in 52 hours. The result was
the evolution of a population of RNA molecules with
substantially improved catalytic power. They report this
continuous in vitro evolution can be perpetuated indefinitely.

I see no evidence for it either; this is an essentially unfalsifiable
hypothesis. It should be noted that the laws of physics seems 
inordinately fond of creating complexity, but we don't know enough about 
possible other forms of physics to tell if this is a generic property of 
realities or if our physics really is unusual in some way.

BUT..... SF can also mean 'Speculative Fiction', so 'Illuminatus!' can be
SF but not Sci-Fi. This is perhaps where the confusion occured.

cf. 'Quantum Psychology' and 'The New Inquisition' by the same author if
you are interested in non-fiction extropian wanderings. I've heard that
'Cosmic Trigger' 1, 2 and 3 are excellent?

I enjoyed DA as well.  It has a reasonably good description of an
economy based on nanotech.  I would have paid the price of the book
for the scene in which we get introduced to the "young ladies primer"
from the sub-title of the book, but on pedagogical, not
nanotechnological grounds.  I didn't like the ending at all, (actually
the last third or so) as the story gets lost in meanderings about
group minds and other miscellany.

I don't think there is really much flexibility in what to call success.
If you disagree, perhaps you could take the original paper I cited,
choose some other measure of success, and show how you get a different
result.

I know that such an animal exists. My possibly faulty recollection is
that the Fort St. Varain (sp) power station reactor was a thorium fueled
pilot plant along these lines.
Bechtel Inc. was involved in some of the licensing engineering for it, so 
might be a source of info. Sadly I've lost touch with the the engineer I 
knew who used to work at that plant.

                MIT PHYSICS OF COMPUTATION SEMINAR

                Date: Monday, May 12, 1997
                Time: 3:30 pm  (Refreshments after the talk)
                Room: MIT NE43, 8th floor AI Playroom (545 Tech Sq)


    "Quantum Telecomputation"

    LOV K. GROVER
    AT&T Bell Labs

    Abstract:

    Quantum mechanics permits certain kinds of non-local effects. This
    talk demonstrates how these can be used for distributed computation
    with minimal communication between various processors. The problem
    considered is that of estimating the mean of N items to a certain
    precision. First a serial quantum mechanical algorithm for this is
    presented that is faster than any classical algorithm. Next it is
    shown how this can be efficiently parallelized with quantum
    mechanical processors that are remotely located.  These processors
    consist of coupled EPR particles. Each processor has just to
    communicate one bit of classical information to a central location
    at the end of its local computation.
    
    Host:  Norm Margolus

    
This talk is part of a seminar series on adapting computers and
computations to the constraints of, and opportunities afforded by,
microphysics; and on the development and application of the physical
theory of computation and information.  This seminar series is
supported by the MIT AI Laboratory's Reversible Computing Project.

Please forward this notice to anyone who you think might be interested.
Anyone who wishes to be added to the distribution list for these seminar
announcements should send email to "poc@mit.edu".  Copies of papers
related to recent and upcoming POC talks are available through the World
Wide Web at "http://www.im.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/poc.pl".

Several ideas were quite interesting, such as the descriptions of the 
paper computers, tuple processing (quite natural in a nanotech world) and 
CryptNet.

I think it is a hard balance for a creative author to avoid getting lost 
in all the interesting ideas and still provide a rich world. After all, 
every single thing in the world is a potential story in itself. I think 
Greg Egan's _Distress_ is a fine example of a story that doesn't get too 
lost in its complex world; not all threads need to get neatly (or 
worse, hurriedly) tied up.

Saw this relevant story on news.com on 4/30/97.

"A House subcommittee today approved a
bill that would remove most of the Clinton
administration's current restrictions on the export of
encryption technology. "

". . . intended to eliminate the White
House's export regulations on strong encryption,
basically letting software vendors export crypto
technology of any strength provided that it is being
used for legal purposes. "

Slam protons into a target to get pions, then spin the pions in a

Which I am, and I'm working hard to prove it. Maybe in about 3 or 4
months, maybe in a year, I can give you a fully documented analysis of
the effects of economic liberation (and economy & freedom in general). 

I find it amusing that certain beliefs must not be questioned on the
Extropian mailing list. U sure you aren't a religous cult? :-)

Oh man, you did it. You made me laugh, which rarely occurs on this list.
This is one of the funniest Libertarian explanations for inequality I've
ever read.

But to become serious again: Education _is_ a real problem. Not only
education of the poor, but also education of those who are able to buy
whole universities. Money means power, and in a world where some people
are much richer than others, you will always have explicit power
structures.

Decisions of today are made by this power elite. This ain't the big bad
government guys, it's those economic rulers, investment banks especially
(Brown Brothers Harriman, Morgan Investment Trust). They own all the
larger companies and, as if this wouldn't be enough, also manage them
with their people sitting in the board of directors.

They WANT government. Goverment is an easy way to get money (taxes) and
to invest it the way they want. Government therefore doesn't only (or
does hardly) do "clever" investments. Pushing weapons industry, for
example, always helps big companies to grow bigger and to crush smaller
companies, for it doesn't raise the life standard.

Remove government and you get a dictatorship of banks / monopolies. Much
worse than gov't could ever be. Freedom? You'll be so free, you'll want
to buy a whole load of guns in order to defend yourself from street
thugs. Equality? Raising life standard? Nope. But nobody who defends
markets claims that -- that's natural selection. Eat or be eaten. Live
and let die.

Conclusion: Make those powerful guys cleverer, and they'll recognize
that making the everone else cleverer, too, will be to their own benefit
in the long term. That's all you need. No communism (any communist
movement is crushed in its roots, whether by media propaganda or by
weapons power), no free markets and no dictatorships (whereas these two
are actually the same).

I advocate efforts to help the poor. They'll never be enough to save the
poor children, though. And anyone who puts this phrase in quotation
marks should take a look. 12.5 million each year, have fun on your
vacation. Poor, poor children -- they're just too stupid, or their
parents are, or government is evil, or aliens have infiltrated them, or
they've deserved it, or ...

Anyway, I hope this isn't classified as "rant" again. I hope some of you
think about what I say, or it is a waste of time. I don't want to insult
anyone, I'm a peaceful guy. Maybe I just want the same thing you do:
Make this world a better place.

I think the question is : is economic liberation beneficial to the *global*
situation. History bears witness to the fact that economic liberation is
definately beneficial to national economies, but I'm not so sure the same
could be said of the whole world situation. I would like to see an analysis
these two scenarios in your forthcoming essay.

I think your are correct that there is sometimes a hint of knee-jerk
dogmatic responses on this list.

About a month ago we had a discussion, after some inquiries about 
supplements and nootropics, of how to test and measure the effects of 
these substances.

Lee Daniel Crocker suggested this was "simple":
<Give a dozen people a euphoric, and another dozen a vitamin or 
something, then have them all answer multiple-choice questions about 
how they feel. If the answers to some question correlate strongly 
enough with those who took the real drug, you've shown a measured 
effect (certainly not a conclusive one, but at least better than 
nothing).>

While what Lee suggested may be a useful approach for determining if 
there is *any* effect, I suggested it wouldn't be very helpful for 
quantifying or qualifying the effect because human health, moods and 
cognitive capacities, are too complex a system to submit to simple 
mechanical measurements.  One of the reasons, I suggested, was that 
these substances can have multiple effects and the effects may differ 
depending on the subject's neurochemical background at the time.

Along these lines, today's Wall Street Journal has several articles 
that look at the surprising complexity in the effects of one of the 
most commonly used nootropic substances, namely nicotine.

One article, "Kicking the Habit: Personality May Predispose Some to 
Nicotine Addiction" by Robert Langreth, notes that "Indeed, nicotine 
even seems to have varying effects on the same people at different 
times of day" and quotes Neal Benowitz, a tobacco researcher at the 
University of California at San Francisco, saying "It is one of the 
few drugs that can be a stimulant first thing in the morning, a 
tranquilizer later in the day for people who are anxious and a mild 
antidepressant for people who are feeling a little down".

One of the difficulties in substantiating nootropic effects is that, 
over time, the body acquires a 'tolerance' to them so that the effects 
can vary depending on how long someone has used the substance.  As 
Langreth's article puts it: "Researchers don't know exactly why, but 
they suspect that over time, the brain becomes accustomed to operating 
with a certain level of nicotine, and eventually depends on nicotine 
to produce even normal levels of dopamine and other brain chemicals."

The article also pointed out that genes may be important for who 
becomes addicted to nicotine: "Numerous studies of identical twins 
show that if one twin smokes, the other also does about 80% of the 
time; this is true only about half of the time for fraternal twins, 
who don't have matching genes. The commonality between identical twins 
exists even in cases where the twins were reared apart, indicating 
that genetics -- not environmental factors like the close bond that 
often forms between twins -- are at work."

A companion article, "Kicking the Habit: Antidepressants Give New Hope 
To Hard Cases Trying to Quit" by Elyse Tanouye, also provides some 
insights on the multiple and synergistic effects nicotine and other 
nootropics may have.  Basically, this article describes how nicotine 
affects dopamine and norepinephrine levels but seems not to affect 
serotonin levels.

Linda H. Ferry who conducted a study at a California VA medical center 
said that "Nicotine is the best and most effective over-the-counter 
antidepressant available in the world". Her study found that 
Wellbutrin (generic name bupropion, which may soon be approved by the 
FDA as Zyban) is an effective substitute for nicotine because it 
boosts both dopamine and norepinephrine levels: "In two small trials, 
she found that smokers who took the drug were two or three times more 
likely to quit than those who took a placebo."

Most interesting to me, as a recovering smoker now using only the 
nicotine gum, was the insight that there are "nicotine receptors 
inside the mouth and throat" in addition to those in the brain.  In 
fact, in my own experience, I could do without nicotine most of the 
time (I still chew four or five 2 mg pieces per day) except for the 
oral craving.  Jed Rose, a Duke University nicotine researcher, has 
had success "using substances like citric acid" to relieve these 
cravings.  This confirmed my own experience that grapefruit juice was 
a big help in reducing these cravings.  I've also noticed that 
piracetam somehow almost completely eliminates these cravings, as well 
as the more generalized nicotine anxiety which probably originates in 
the brain.

The point for Extropians, most of whom are probably not smokers, is 
that any of these nootropic substances that work on the brain are 
likely to have many, entangled and difficult to measure effects.

Me, a faithful lunatic, has always been mesmerized by the
Moon as the major future space industry location. However,
near-Earth asteroids might prove to be much more
interesting first target for prospection and mining.

The major minus of the Moon is the distance, its location
at the bottom of a (shallow, though) gravity well, and
kinetical unaccesibility of certain resources due to
differentiation in the course of ur-material accretion.
Vastly simplified, this means dense minerals accumulating
at the core (which is pretty inaccessible due to pressure,
and uncomfortably hot in the bargain), light in the outer
shell, and generic depletion of light elements, which
have escaped into space, being literally baked out
(especially true for our beloved, forever smallpox-marked
Mona).

Ceres, the first planetoid, was discovered in 1801 in Palermo
(by one Piazzi). We now know more than 2 k objects in orbits
between Mars and Jupiter. More than 30 objects have orbits
with the perihelion within Mars orbit. About 20 objects
have their perihelions within the Earth orbit, this are
the Apollo asteroids. Asteroids are commonly classified
in Hirayama families by their orbit data; about 40 such
families are known. Additionally, there are the Trojans,
which move in 60 deg distance onto Jupiter orbit, as seen
from the Sun (as predicted by Lagrange).

These are but the largest primeval debris pieces, smaller ones
being inaccessible to astronomic observations. The smaller the
body, the larger the probability of a close encounter. For mining,
planetoids of few 10-100 m size are more than sufficient. Few
g/cm^3 density assuming, that's a lot of material outside the
Earth gravity well.

For prospection, appropriate targets must first be found. As now
widespread Peltier-cooled CCDs and "lightweight giant" amateur
telescopy has now reached very respectable dimensions, many
asteroids are discovered by hobbyists (notice NEAP's $500
bribe). Furthermore, recently emerged awareness for rare, but
desastrous hits by relatively small (few km) asteroids, might
soon grant us a new watchful chain of eyes.

Once discovered, not much information can be futhur gained
by remote sensing. Sure, we can measure the albedo (and
its fluctuations, which give us the rotation frequency,
and lots of information about geometry and surface
reflectance distribution), maybe utilize the Hubble, or
radar, but still, investigation by a probe will still be
mandatory. The intercepting probe must first match its
speed, then go into orbit (inasmuch a few 100 m body might
be said to have enough mass for a measureable orbit, whereas
the larger asteroids escape velocity cannot even be reached
by vigorous jumping) . The volume can be very precisely
measured by evaluation of a surface snapshot sequence,
while in orbit. Average density is available from orbit
data (we sure know the mass of the probe).

There are three types of chondrites known: carbonaceous
chondrites (further subdivided in types I, II, III), plain
chondrites, and enstatite chondrites.

Electrolysing (PV electricity) a molten silicate poodle,
whether with metal or carbon (pyrographite from carbonaceous

Electrolysed water may yield hydrogen for reduction, metal
and molten silicate glass material for truss rods construction
(imagine neoariadne agents, deftly spinning glass fibre in
space). Sputtered aluminum and iron are great material for
mirrors, ebeam cannons are useful for deploying these.
Inductive metallurgy is easy to do, under microgravitation
conditions, and lots of hard vacuum.

Producing semiconductor-grade silicon will be sure a chore
under this circumstances. Sad thing beam writers bein a

This discussion does not belong on the Extropians mailing list. If Erik and
others want to argue about whether free markets or state control are best
for poor children, take it to the Transhuman list, or some other place.

The list rules are very clear about this. Eric broke the rules. I ask
others not to respond to his posts on this topic here. Let's keep this list
for its intended purpose.

Erik, your comment about religious cults was asinine and uncalled for. Do
you publish articles on totally irrelevant topics in Homo Excelsior? Would
you publish an article comparing two makes of automobile, or a how-to guide
on brick-laying? Didn't think. So please respect the founding principles of
our list. Extropians love to debate economic issues, but this list is not
the place for this discussion.

Max,

You make the rules, and I'm not going to try and break them just for the
sake of it, but I disagree that there are certain topics that should not be
discussed on this list. Even the basics should be questioned from time to
time. Since you defined extropy, and outlined most of the principles, it is
your job to vigorously defend them in debate, rather than outlawing
discussions. If you take the standpoint that there are certain principles
that cannot be questioned, you are no different to the Spanish Inquisition.
Extropy is going to come under a huge attack from certain section of the
community in the future, once the meme really starts to propagate, so you
had better get used to it.

I wish to point out that I respect you and your creative/analytical mind
and I agree with most of the extropian principles. Furthermore this post
does not in any way constitute a personal attack.

Of course they can be questioned; just not *here*.  To say that
everyone has a right to raise any issue in any forum is to say, for
example, that door-to-door religion advocates have a right to come
into your living room and preach at you for as long as they want.

Very interesting.  Please enlighten me on this process you use to know
things BEFORE proving them.  This could be a very useful process.  At the
very least, it could give us an insight into the minds of the religious.

Of course, if you have a proof that free markets are bad in both the long
term and the short term I would love to hear it because it would mean that
I could form a better picture of the world.  The same goes for God and the
invisible leprechauns running around my chair.

Most of us who have been here a while reach a point where such things

Excellent commentary. However, I point out one concept in asteroidal
refining that is illustrated in Jerry Pournelle and Charles Sheffield's
novel _Higher_Education_, which just came out late last year. THis uses
a large tube constructed of a carbon/carbon type matrix, possibly using
buckyfiber, surrounded by induction heaters. The asteroid is shut inside
the tube and heated up to molten level. It is then spun to provide
centrifugal separation of its components by element, which are each
drained in series from spigots on the outside.

The plutonium bomb used was not a tamper type, that was the uranium bomb
used on Hiroshima. The one used on Nagasaki was plutonium, and used a
sphere of TNT charges. Your original comment was concerning the lack of
security with so much plutonium around. Given this, one must expect that
those seeking to take advantage of this would be terrorists who not only
are not known for their technical sophistication, but also for not
taking proper safety measures. One would expect them to make as cheap
and easy a bomb as possible, thus the most technically simple types
would be those used. One would also expect them to poison themselves
with radioactivity while in the process of putting such a device
together.

Excuse me? SUre there are similar components used for explosives use,
but they have nowhere near the same tolerance level. Your 80 cent
component cannot be used for the detonation sphere of a plutonium bomb.
Those that are of proper performance are highly controlled munitions.

And rather obvious as well. How children turn out is entirely based on
the choices their parents made, even before they were born. I'm 29 with
no kids, because I choose to not reproduce until I am in my own opinion
able to provide a responsible environment for my kids. This is not just
me either. My older brother, currently much farther along the same
track, is still expecting to wait at least another 5 years before having
kids. The only people I know who have had kids and are my age are the
idiots who did not go on to college. Most of them are bankrupt and
divorced by now at least once.

Duh, and there will alwasy be black holes and quasars too. Communist
systems also had their moguls, you just never heard about them because
their wealth was a state secret, and if you complained it was off to the
cotton mines for you.

WHile I personally see no merit in large inheritances, those that get to
such positions due to their own skill and drive to me deserve to be

HAH, now you did it. Its the old imperialist gun makers routine again.
Sorry you could not be more wrong. I can tell you for a fact that the
absolute very worst thing for any arms company's long term stability is
war and arms buildups. If you look at all of the arms companies
operating over the last 200 years, you will find that at a bare minimum,
90% of them go bankrupt within 2 years of the end of a major war or arms
buildup. WHy? because in war and during buildups, governments give them
huge orders beyond their capacity to meet, so they expand furiously to
meet the artificial demand, and often are under strict quotas of
production which they cannot vary from, even when any idiot can see that
a war is almost over and it would be wise to start shifting resources
back to consumer production. Once the war or buildup ends, government
contracts are cancelled, leaving huge amounts of capacity idle for a
bare minimum of 6 months to 5 years, which is the kicker that breaks
companies backs. 

People still are wondering why Russia is still in the pits. Its obvious,
they still havent fully converted from a wartime production footing.

THis lesson has already been learned by our most successful
billionaire/mogul/tycoon/capitalist running dog oppressor, Bill Gates,
as well as scores of other technology industrialists. You've still got
problems over there because you've got ex-communist party bosses running
around playing 19th century robber baron. You should have strung them up
when you had the chance.

That is what most of us are after, but we know from experience that much
more is done constructively by individuals on a volunteer basis than any
centrally planned solution. It is a fact that Americans are the very
most charitable givers in the world, at the very same time that we are
considered by most to be the most capitalist.

The rest of the post is littered with economic fallacies (mainly that
corporations are more concerned about power than money) but this is the
paragraph that I think deserves the most dissection.

A society without dictatorships (or more generally, coercion) is a free
market.  How do you propose to educate these "powerful guys"?  Persuasive
argument or at the end of a gun?  One is the free market and the other is
government.

> Maybe I just want the same thing you do:

The temptation to sarcasm is great but I shall resist.  Nobody on this list
is evil.  There are some who are stupid and ignorant but nobody sets out to
do deliberate harm.  This can be said of most people in the population. 
How many people do you know who go around saying "My goal in life is to
make the world a horrible place to live,"?  There are many who have that
effect but most would say that making the world a better place is a worthy
goal.

I've had extropian ideas for a long time and when I found out that there was an 
extropian movement, I thought "Great!  There are people who think like me!  Perhaps are 
they going to help me grow faster."

But all I see on web pages and all I read in this mailing list's messages are theories 
or general ideas.  I can make theories.  I can have general ideas.  We all can.  It's 
fun to think about exploiting the moon's ressources or about changing social structures, 
but it doesn't really change anything that can be immediately felt.

I think it would be good to be a bit more practical about extropianism.  I'd really like 
to read information on where to get drugs that can make you think faster or feel a 
certain way.  Such drugs are sometimes legal and available to the public, but we just 
don't know about them.  Putting an end to this kind of ignorance would be beneficial to 
us.  Understanding how the drugs work on us could further our knowledge of ourselves and 
truly make us grow.

And what about existing technology?  We've made wonderful things already, much more than 
we usually imagine.  Why dream about future technology when there's so much we already 
have but don't use?  Getting to know the tools we already can use would certainly help 
us acheive greater technological advences faster.

What I'm saying is that it may be nice to dream about things, but it's better to do 
things, to apply theories, to build upon what's already built.  What I'd like to see is 
an "extropian resource guide" of some sort in which one could find information that 
could be immediately used to expand one's physical and intellectual capacities.

Entries in that guide could include such things as hormones presently available to 
modify the body, chemicals presently available to modify the mind, technology already 
available to explore the human mind (biofeedback devices, personal EEG boxes, etc.), 
genetic analysis centers, "extropian food" presently available, etc...

Sure, I want to be a cyborg, but right now, precisely what can science and technology 
make me?

In a message dated 97-05-05 16:09:26 EDT, you write:

Oh, come now, Erik.  Think about it.  If you remove government, you also
remove all the rules and regulations, not to mention subsidies, which are
allowing these monopolies, banks, and such to exist in the first place.  If
government were completely eliminated, so would be the source(s) of power
which monopolies and banks now hold.  Almost immediately, alternative sources
of everything would pop up all over by free marketers who would like to earn
a profit.  New banks, not held to stupid "Federal Reserve" standards would
open.  MONOPOLIES CAN NOT EXIST IN AN ANARCHO-CAPITALISTIC SOCIETY!

As for your comment on what you think would be an apparent rise in crime,
that's also rediculous, but the part about us all buying guns is true.  We
should all have them anyway, to protect ourselves from others who may use
force against us, to rob us or harm us.  But these "rebels" would soon
discover that using force against people in an anarcho-capitalistic society
is about the fastest way to "check out" of this life.  Anyone I catch robbing
me or trying to harm me, once we have an anarcho-capitalistic society, will
find themselves dead quite quickly.  Force may be used only when someone else
is using force against you or your property.  That's my opinon.

This is unclear. Are you saying that even the rich will be uneducated and

Unless every human on Earth dies or goes into a comma, power will exist.  
Power that is chaotic destroys everything around it, so power that lasts any 
length of time is always organized. So when something is organized it has a 
structure, so we will always have explicit power structures, so what is your 
point?


        >Decisions of today are made by this power elite. 
               

Not everyone makes important decisions, so those that do are an elite, 
so decisions of today are made by a power elite, so what is your point?
               

        >it's those economic rulers, investment banks [...] They WANT

True. As I've said before whenever there is a proposal to deregulate an 
industry the strongest opposition always come from the industry itself.

True again, and be advocating even more government you'd be playing right 
into their hands.
               

        >Remove government and you get a dictatorship of banks / monopolies. 


Huh? That is the exact opposite of what you said just one sentence before.

Naturally, nothing is free. There will always be street thugs and I will 
always want to be protected from them.  Today the government says they and 
only they may offer this protection, they tell me how much protection I will

It is well known that the only fault of communism was that it allowed total 
freedom of the press and they were far too tolerant of those who disagreed 
with them. Stalin only killed 20 million of his own people, if he'd shoved 40 
or 50 million into ovens everything would have been perfect. Next time, 
no more Mr. Nice Guy.

You have something to sell at a price I'm willing to pay and no third party  
is forcing us to do anything. Appalling! Totalitarian! Pure dictatorship!

A noble aim, but if most people agree with you then why do we need government? 
If most people don't agree with you then how will government help?

Erik, that doesn't sound very scientific. You've already reached your 
conclusion, now you just need the evidence. If you're bound and determined to 
obtain evidence to support you viewpoint I can guarantee you that is exactly 
what you will find, and it doesn't matter in the slightest what that 
viewpoint is.

It's just that most think the Extropian mailing list is no place for
Extropy 101, an idea I disagree with by the way.

     As an independent thinking extopian, I would like to ask everyone of
their opinion on the following idea.  Since we do not believe in coercion,
and we don't believe in using force against others (except in self defense),
then it would seem to me that there would be no "crime" committed by being
nude in public.
     In an Extropian type, anarcho-capitalistic society, clothing would
definately be optional.  I only raise this issue because so very many people
think it is "evil" to be nude.  I think mandating that all people wear
clothes is somewhat like mandating that everyone have car insurance.  It's
great for the clothing industry, and to foster control over people, but it's
seems to me that "mandatory clothing in public" is as rediculous of a concept
as any of which I can think.
     I know many of you may say that it is a trivial matter, but I think it's
deeper than that.  It's about freedom.  Please respond with comments,
whatever your opinons are.  Thanks.       Shawn Johnson

Yes, it's deep.  Yes, it's about freedom.  But so are lots of things.
I have chosen to leave that particular battle unfought for the nonce.
It's a special case, and I prefer to work on the general principles
of tolerance, rationality, nonaggression, and do on.

>From the song "Live and Let Live", by Leslie Fish:

Whatever you may choose to wear is no concern to me.
Wear nothing, or gorilla suits, or gowns made in Paree.
Just don't sit naked on my chairs, it's sure to leave a splotch,
And don't complain to me if you get sunburn in your crotch.

Live and let live is the only thing to do.
The causes we can fight for don't need adding to.
Freedom and survival are cause enough to hit,
So stick to what's worth fighting for -- forget the diddly shit.

The Hiroshima bomb used a gun to fire a slug of U235 at a target also of U235, 
it was the only gun type A bomb ever made. Of course the plutonium bomb used 
a sphere of explosives, but it was not TNT it was HMX, also called Octogen, 
a much faster explosive, it has a detonation velocity of 9100 meters per

       HMX or OCTOGEN

             
If you're willing to sacrifice a little efficiency you could use TNT and 
it's a lot cheaper. The HMX did not push directly on the plutonium it pushed 
on a heavy tamper sphere of U238 (the easy to obtain type) around the inner 
sphere of plutonium. The U238 sphere was not involved in any nuclear 
reactions it was used because it is a dense metal, it reflected neutrons back 
to their source, it helped to make the spherical shock wave more even, and 
when the plutonium started to get hot its great mass slowed its expansion to 
give the plutonium more time to complete its nuclear reactions.

That's 80 dollars, and they have no use in conventional explosives but they 
are used in neutron activation analysis, a very peaceable purpose. You'd have 
to use a Krytron in a Uranium bomb, but not with plutonium, although it would 
be more efficient if you did.

I've seen quite a bit of odd stuff on the Exi List, but this one really
tries my patience and I think the thread should be moved to the
psychoceramics list.

The US Patent Office has a policy re perpetual motion machines, which I
think should also be applied here:

Wrong. You can run your photon through a set of filters, each of which
is 45 degrees turned relative to the previous filter. If the photon was
originally at 45 degrees, it will always be blocked by the second filter
in the series. What actually happens is that each filter takes out 50%
of the incident photons, and the second filter therefore passes 25% of
the photons, the third passes 12.5%, etc. The point is that quantum
values are indeterminate, which means not fixed until measured!

Sure, if the other photon hasn't interacted with something, which you
can't know faster than light speed.

Tony, please note that I did *not* say that certain things could not be
discussed. I said that certain things could not be discussed *on this

reign. That doesn't mean I want to set rules for anyone else's private

What's the big deal about putting this discussion on another list? You can
even send a message here pointing interested parties to that discussion.

We've done remarkably well without moderation. Let's try to keep it that way.

Agree that baaed on the list rules this thread is inappropriate. 

I suggest either the paid subscription (or variant) or the institution of a policy that topics like free-market vs (x) *must* be discussed purely in E-Prime--violators to be banished, no warning, no exceptions.


Harsh, but effective.

This is a fine axample of "hemline morality", conservative norms that 
remain even when they are inapplicable. I wonder if a human with fur 
would be considered naked? 

Personally I doubt clothing would ever become truly optional for most
people - we live in the wrong climate and need to carry around various
things (OK, the things could presumable bye shrunk, implanted or virtual).

As an example of more "practical" Extropianism, litenite suggests:
<I'd really like to read information on where to get drugs that can

There are plenty of Web sites and online catalogs devoted to these 
topics - just do a search.

Also,

Here's a somewhat facetious answer:

That seems like a reasonable assessment. Of course, people might
contractually agree not to go nude within common areas of a private
contractually based community, but that's of course not what you are
talking about.

Of course it isn't "evil" except to supersitious people like certain
religious sects.  On the other hand, I think it's frequently tasteless
-- most people's bodies are not particularly appetizing, and look
better when clothed to conceal the lack of care that has been taken to
maintain them.  Tastelessness, of course, is not a crime -- if it
were, wearing a loud hawaiian shirt would be just as "evil" as
nudity. Neither should be legally sanctioned.

Yeah, a bit of a problem isn't it?

Unfortunately, there are only a few reasonable places to apply one's
efforts as things stand: life extension, self improvement (mental,
physical and resource improvement all come to mind) and political
efforts.

Life Extension is actually one of the easy places to attack -- simply
switching to a very low fat diet (vegan is easiest), quitting smoking,
and exercising will get you a long, long way. I also take antioxidants
(including vitamin E), a general ironless multivitamin supplement
(excess iron is linked to heart disease), and chromium picolinate. I
may start taking more things as I age.

I also am signed up for cryonics, which is a bit of an insurance
policy. I hope never to have to be frozen, but if something happens to
me, I'd prefer not to be dead.

I also contribute heavily to libertarian political causes, although I
am much less personally active than I used to be. I think at this
point, I do better specializing in my field and contributing a couple
of hours of earnings to Cato than spending tens of hours on amateur
politics.

I'm not particularly sanguine about the current generation of "smart
drugs" -- thus far, most of the reports people have put out on the
subject have been of the form "well, it might have made a slight
difference, but..."

On the other hand, drugs like Deprinyl (sp?) probably make a long term
difference in preserving mental acuity as we age.

As for other sorts of drugs, well, most people are reluctant to talk
about them, the political and legal situation being what it is.

Well... perhaps you have a project for yourself. The rest of us might
not be sufficiently motivated, but as long as you are willing to
contribute such a section to the FAQ, please do!

> Sure, I want to be a cyborg, but right now, precisely what can science

It can help you extend your life so that you'll be around to enjoy the
benefits of mid 21st century technology.

It can help you get a "safety net" in the form of cryonics in case
nothing else works and you deanimate anyway.

It can help you, if you are clever enough, to grow wealthy and thus
gain resources with which to achieve your dreams.

Unfortunately, it can't do a lot else for you -- yet. We are just
starting to peer into the future -- we haven't gotten there yet.

It's even worse then that; the heavy elements accumulated in the lunar core,
but there weren't many heavy elements there in the first place.  Apparently
the Moon originated when something hit the Earth and knocked a big chunk of
it into orbit.  Since the Earth had already separated into core and mantle
at that time, the stuff that got knocked off was all mantle, and consisted
mostly of the boring elements O, Si, Mg and Al.

>We now know more than 2 k objects in orbits
>between Mars and Jupiter. 

Lots more than that, actually.  To be officially 'numbered', a minor planet
has to have an orbit that is known with sufficient accuracy that we can find
it again when we look any time in the next few decades.  There were 6300
numbered asteroids two years ago; probably by now there are more than 7000
(I can't find recent data).  There are also more than 112,000 observations
of minor planets with too little accuracy to be numbered; typically any
given minor planet accumulates several such preliminary observations before
its orbit is pinned down and it gets a number.

I just counted 27 inside the orbit of earth *now*; those with perihelia
inside earth orbit must be substantially more numerous.  Look at the amazing
and wonderful charts 

http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/ps/lists/InnerPlot.html

and 

http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/ps/lists/OuterPlot.html 

to see what's up in our neighborhood.

>Asteroids are commonly classified

90% of asteroids do not belong to any known Hiriyama family.  The families
originate when a body is smashed into smaller pieces by an impact.  The
pieces have similar compositions and pursue similar orbits for a few million
years.  Eventually the orbits drift apart from each other and the family
resemblance is lost.

>Additionally, there are the Trojans,
>which move in 60 deg distance onto Jupiter orbit, as seen

Probably there are as many bodies in the Trojan clouds as in the main belt,
but since they are further away, less brightly lit, and covered with
(mysterious) coal-black stuff, not as many of them have been observed.

>These are but the largest primeval debris pieces, smaller ones
>being inaccessible to astronomic observations. 

More precisely, nobody wants to pay for the astronomic observations.  An
astronomer with a professional-grade telescope (cost ~$300,000) can find new
asteroids at a rate of one or two a night.  Finding a new asteroid costs
about $1000, and there are thousands available at this cost.  Once these are
found, there are hundreds of thousands available at $5000 each.  Automation
could bring these prices down substantially. 

I'm just making up these costs, but I think they're right to a factor of
two.  Back when I was in grad school, I spent a lot of time studying
asteroids and hanging out with people who looked for them.  It was cool
stuff, but it didn't pay the bills, so I went back to doing computer stuff.

In an anarcho-capitalistic society, what else is there besides private
areas and "common areas of a private contractually based community"?
Assuming all land is owned by someone, and all law is by private
contract, all laws regarding display of nudity would also be by
private contract.

I would predict that in most common areas, nudity would be illegal.
As Perry indicated, most people find it tasteless, and it is an
especialy easy to define and enforce tasteless behavior in this area.
That is, most people are willing to pay more to have nudity go away
than the potential nudists are willing to pay to parade around nude.

I would also predict widespread exceptions, accessible from most
locations, where common nudity is legal.

Most of the information is quite unreliable. I suggest looking at the
original papers, but they are usually a quite depressing reading (many
enthusiasts just read the medline abstracts, and doesn't notice how limited
the results really are). This is why we need reviewing of information - 
for there are interesting results out there about nootropics.

Yes, it would be a good idea if such a list could be compiled, containing
*reliable* information as opposed to all the anecdotal stuff, advertising and
plain silliness out there in the infosphere; I want carefully tested
information with references and good explanations. This is an entirely
feasible project, although much of the information we really want is as yet
unknown and untested. The nootropic testing project discussed a few weeks ago
might be one way of getting slightly more information in an active way.

I agree completely! Such a resource guide would be very useful, but 
requires some work to maintain and fill. We need somebody who could 
actually manage something like this, and a staff who edited and reviewed 
entries. A bit like the Omega database of Homo Excelsior, but directed 
towards actual tools.

I think the best tools so far are:
	Mental techniques (improving intelligence, rationality, creativity, 
		emotion, memory etc)
	Natural physical improvements (healthy food, exercise, martial arts)
	Nootropics (some work in some ways)
	Information management tools (wearable computers with cellular phone 
		modems, information agents, remembrance agents, decision support 
		programs, mindmap programs)
	Life extension (calorie restriction, healthy food, cryonics)

You don't want current implants, believe me (I'm studying implant technology
for fun right now. BTW, as an exercise I will have to write an analysis/idea
for a novel implant (ideally for medical use) based on today's capabilities:
any ideas for an implant in need of development?).

Being a cyborg is not a matter of having bionics or technology, it is a state
of mind where you construct yourself, designing your life to fit your values.

You're falling into the statist misconception that becasue there is no
government, there will be no rules.  Property owners can still set their own
rules, and as long as current popular opinion about public nudity prevails
(many are offended and only a few want it) it's a good bet that most public
spaces - malls, park, roads, and offices - will continue to bar nudity.  No
doubt you will see clothing-optional spaces, which you can't find now, but
they will be in the minority.

It's a cool concept, but nature has tried it, and the separation is not that
good.  All the planets and most large asteroids have been entirely molten at
some time in their past, and they have seperated into only three chemically
distinct units, thanks to the miscibility of elements:

--Iron, nickel, carbon, and heavy metals.  Geologists call this "core" and
steelworkers call it "molten steel".

--Silicates rich in aluminum and magnesium.  Geologists call this "mantle
and crust" and steelworkers call it "slag".

--Water, carbon dioxide, and various bad smells.  Geologists call this
"atmosphere and oceans", and steelworkers call it "flue gases".

You can spin all you want, but I don't think things will seperate much more
than this, any more than a bottle of ocean water will seperate into a pile
of salt with fresh water on top.

Does anyone know of a general semantics or E-Prime mailing list

Even flaming would become useful - if everyone was really picky and

Anyone know of a list, or does anyone want to start one?

I don't agree that Extropians do not believe in coercion. They may not
believe in corecion by the State, but how do they propose to effect even
contractual law without any form of enforcement? If there are areas where
people cannot be nude, despite their wishing to do so, then they must be
being coerced into wearing clothes in those areas (or not entering them
when naked). If there are areas where people can be nude, despite the
disapproval of others, then those others must be being coerced into
allowing the nudity to continue.

You can couch this in terms of contractual obligation, anarcho-capitalism
or anything else, but it won't remove the fact that one person or group of
people are controlling what another person or group of people can and
cannot do.

               V O N   N E U M A N N ' S   D A Y



A one-day international conference, organized by the Logic Systems
Laboratory of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne
(EPFL) on Friday July 25th, 1997, will remember John von Neumann's
contributions to bio-inspired computer science. With the assistance of
international specialists in the field, and notably of Dr. Christopher
Langton of the Santa Fe Institute (US), we will try to determine the
progress of John von Neumann's dream: what have we achieved in the
field of self-reproducing computing machines?


DESCRIPTION

In 1997, we commemorate the 40th anniversary of the death of John von
Neumann. Aside from his contributions to mathematics, John von Neumann
is considered one of the founders of the fields of computer science
and engineering, notably giving his name to the standard architecture
of computers. In the last years of his life, starting at the end of
the forties, his research was marked by a strong biological
inspiration. His last major contribution, the conception of a self-
reproducing cellular automaton, demonstrates an exceptional vision and
daring. Vision, because he borrowed from biology the concept of
genomic information before the discovery of the DNA's double-helix
structure (which implies that, to reproduce, an organism requires a
description of itself). Daring, because his automaton is capable of
both universal construction and universal computation.

But neither von Neumann himself nor his direct successors (Burks,
Thatcher, Codd, etc.) were able to simulate the automaton in its
entirety, and much less to physically implement it. In 1984,
Dr. Christopher Langton introduced a new self- replicating cellular
automaton, simple enough to be entirely simulated. The repercussions
of this work were considerable, both for computer science in general
(with the birth of the concept of "artificial life") and for the
self-replication of artificial organisms in particular.

The goal of this special day is to revisit von Neumann's and Langton's
historical contributions, and to ascertain our progress in the
self-replication of computing machines.

Teue, but it's not relevant, at least not very relevant, if you're talking 
about an individual proton. The concept of probability starts to get 
fuzzy and not very rigorous when you  talk about individual one of a kind 
events. If I say there is only a 25% chance that it will rain tomorrow and it 
turns out to be a rainy day, was I wrong? If it doesn't rain was I right?  
If that was the only information you had and I never made another prediction 
it would be difficult to form a conclusion about my competence as a weather 
forecaster. 

I'm sure I'll hear from the Bayesian people about that remark.

Maybe, but the Copenhagen interpretation is not the only one consistent with 
the facts.

As I said, even if you instantly change something on the other side of the  
universe you can not use this effect to exchange energy or information, 
the effect is real however, as can be seen in Quantum Cryptography. You can 
also make a destructive measurement on one photon and learn something about 
the other without harming it.

I wrote that there were plenty of Web sites and online catalogs 
devoted to nootropics.  One site I had in mind was Samu's Nootropics 
Resources at
http://www.uta.fi/~samu/nootropics_resources.html

Anders wrote that
<Most of the information is quite unreliable. I suggest looking at the

Most of the information that I've seen on the Net is based on Ward 
Dean and John Morgenthaler's _Smart drugs & nutrients : how to improve 
your memory and increase your intelligence using the latest 
discoveries in neuroscience_ ,1990 ISBN: 0-962-741892.  I don't know 
how reliable their book is nor how good the claim to representing "the 
latest discoveries" is given that it's seven years old.

I think there was alot of interest in the early 90's that sort of 
faded away as people found that "good old-fashioned drugs" (as Hal F 
once aptly put it) were just as good and easier to get ahold of in 
many cases.

Still, I'm not sure all the fragmented, original medical research 
papers would be very useful to the average person.  My approach was to 
get *just* a general, vague description of these substances, try them, 
and *only then* compare my experiences the annecdotes.  This was the 
closest I could come to a 'blinded' study.  The purpose of my post, 
yesterday, on nicotine was to illustrate just how extremely difficult 
and expensive it would be to document all the complex interactions 
related to these substances in a completely scientific and useful 
way.

IOW, as long as the danger appears to be minimal, better to just do 
your own experiments rather than waste hundreds of hours combing the 
medical literature or waiting years and years for objective, 
non-commercial studies that may never be conducted.  As Perry pointed 
out:
<As for other sorts of drugs, well, most people are reluctant to talk 
about them, the political and legal situation being what it is.>

In my earlier response to litenite I gave an example of a current 
'cyborg' technology (Xybernaut's $5K Mobile Assistant 
speech-activated, head-mounted display for maintenance manuals).  I 
said "somewhat facetious"  because I'd really love to have such a 
device to access my own systems and the Web, anytime, anywhere.

However, assuming the head-mount may eventually shrink to something 
like sunglasses, I think the big disadvantage of the current device is 
that it must be speech-activated.  I can picture a team of people in a 
meeting, or sitting at their individual work stations, all apparently 
babbling to themselves.  Social animals that we are, this may be 
unacceptable.

SO, the next step, and my idea for one of the first practical 
semi-implant devices, would be subvocalizing speech-activation device. 
 On second thought, this could probably just be some sort of necklace. 
 I was thinking that this would be something implanted in the throat 
with some sort of lead coming out through the skin to connect to an 
external electronic device.  Still, some type of simple implant such 
as this with an external connection that avoids infectious and 
immunolgical problems would be an nice advance (unless something 
similar has already been done?)

No, it doesn't. 

High economic growth rates to not mean a high life standard. It's
sustainable economic development that counts.

The example of Russia shows best that market liberation makes many
people very poor and a few very rich. The average differs and is
dependant on the power structures in the country, the economic
relationships and the existing economy.

Besides, the most boosting economy of the century, the Japanese, is
characterized by high state intervention.

See the end of my reply to Mr. Metzger and take a look at the real
effects and extent of poverty in the US.

TV is a guaranteed necessity in Germany. It can't be seized in any case.

Best way to manipulate large numbers of people. No free decision.

Oh, it was Stalin's grandson. Then he must be right, of course.

In the US, politicians struggle to make the rich richer. That's all.

Which half doesn't have any mentionable economic relationships to other
countries anymore? After the downfall of the UdSSR this was expectable.
Imagine an isolated Japan.

Countries like Cuba are isolated by politicians (lobbied by big
enterprises). The Helms-Burton law is the best example. Send enough
planes over there and wait 'til they shoot one. The Helms-Burton law is
one of the strongest economic restrictions world-wide, passed by a
"free" country.

They even gave Castro the direct choice to cancel any sanctionations if
he would give up socialism. Of course he didn't. Still Cuba has a low
rate of child mortality and is quite healthy. Compare it to other
non-socialist countries in Latin America and draw your conclusions.

Of course they don't. Poor US citizens suffer from diseases, hunger and

                          CHILD AND YOUTH POVERTY

     Child and youth poverty exacerbates the risk behaviors of
     adolescents, and poverty is a growing problem for America's youth
     (Huston, 1992; Lerner, 1993a). By the end of the 1980s
     approximately 20% of America's children and adolescents were poor
     (Committee on Ways and Means, U.S. House of Representatives,
     1991; Davidson, 1994; Hernandez, 1993; Huston, 1992; Huston, et
     al., in press; Simons, Finlay, & Yang, 1991). Moreover, data in
     the 1992 Kids Count Data Book indicate that across the 1980s the
     percentage of children living in poverty in the United States
     increased by 22%. Indeed, this national trend was present in 40
     states, and continues to increase across the nation (Huston,
     1992). Furthermore, of the 12 million American children under the
     age of three years, 25% live in poor families (Carnegie
     Corporation of New York, 1994). In addition, whereas the number
     of children under age six years decreased by 10% between 1971 and
     1991, the number of poor children in this age group increased by
     60% (Carnegie Corporation of New York, 1994).

     Child poverty occurs in all geographic regions of America. In
     fact, the rates of poverty in rural areas of the Unites States
     are as high as those in the inner cities (Huston, 1992; Jensen,
     1988). Furthermore, the poverty rates were higher in 1989 in
     rural areas than metropolitan areas for every race
     classification, and poverty rates for rural blacks and Hispanics
     exceeded rates for their central city counterparts. The higher
     rural poverty rate exists despite the fact that the rural poor
     tend to be comprised of two-parent families (slightly more than
     half) where at least one of the parents works (67%), as compared
     to metropolitan poor families (25% twoparent families; 56% with
     at least one parent employed; Committee on Ways and Means,1991);
     moreover, poor families in rural areas receive fewer welfare
     benefits and are less likely to live in states that provide Aid
     to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) (Huston, 1992; Jensen,
     1988).

     However, it must be stressed that the probability of being a poor
     child is not equal across racial or ethnic groups. According to
     the 1993 Kids Count Data Book, across the 1987-1991 period the
     average percentage of European American, African American, and
     Latino children who were poor was 11.4%, 44.1%, and 37.9%,
     respectively. Moreover, among Latino groups, Puerto Rican
     children experienced the highest rate of poverty (40.4%) and
     Cuban children experienced the lowest rate (19.7%) (U. S. Bureau
     of the Census, 1991). In addition, it should be noted that, as
     reported in 1991 by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, Asian children
     and Native American children experienced rates of poverty of
     16.7% and 24.9%, respectively.

     The percentages of children in poverty across the 1987-1991
     period represent increases in the rates of poverty over the last
     10 years for all racial/ethnic groups. For example, from 19791989
     child poverty grew worse by 9% for European Americans, by 5% for
     African Americans, and by 25% for Latinos, respectively (Center
     for the Study of Social Policy, 1993). In terms of absolute
     numbers, data from the 1990 Census indicate that 5.9 million
     European-American children lived in poverty, whereas the
     corresponding numbers of AfricanAmericans, Asian-Americans,
     Native-Americans, and Latinos were 3.7 million, 346,000, 260,000,
     and 2.4 million, respectively (Children's Defense Fund, 1992).

     Given the differential probability that different racial/ethnic
     groups will be poor, it seems clear that policies and programs
     must be culturally sensitive in order to effect change. In other
     words, both policies and the programs associated with them must
     be culturally competent (Lerner, 1995); they must be able to deal
     effectively with the specific history, culture, values, mores,
     and meaning systems of the youth and families embedded in
     poverty.

     Indeed, the focus on diversity is crucial because, as noted by
     Huston (1992), race is the most striking and disturbing
     distinction between children whose poverty is chronic and
     children for whom poverty is transitory. For instance, Duncan
     (1992) reports data from the Panel Study on Income Dynamics
     indicating that the average African American child in the study
     spent 5.5 years in poverty; in turn, the average non-African
     American child in the study spent only 0.9 years in poverty.
     Furthermore, as with race and ethnicity, poverty is not equally
     distributed across age groups. In 1989, about 20% of children
     younger than age 6 years were poor, and the corresponding rate of
     poverty for 6- to 17-year-olds was about 17%. In turn, the rates
     for Americans aged 18 to 64 years, or aged 65 years or older,
     were about 11% and 13%, respectively (Children's Defense Fund,
     1992).

     The sequelae of poverty for children and adolescents are
     devastating. Indeed, as Hamburg (1992, p. 48) notes:

          . . . almost every form of childhood damage is far more
          prevalent among the poor--from increased infant
          mortality, gross malnutrition, recurrent and untreated
          health problems, and child abuse in the early years, to
          education disability, low achievement, delinquency,
          early pregnancy, alcohol and drug abuse, and failure to
          become economically self-sufficient.

     Similarly, as Schorr (1988) stresses, poverty creates several
     "rotten outcomes" of youth development. For example, poverty is
     associated with early school failure, with unemployability, with
     long-term welfare dependency, with violent crime, and with
     feelings of hopelessness and despair (McLoyd & Wilson, 1992;
     Schorr, 1988, 1992). Furthermore, McLoyd and Wilson (1992) and
     Klerman (1992) find that poor children live at high risk for low
     self-confidence, conduct problems, depression, and peer conflict.
     In addition, poor children are at risk for encountering severe
     health problems, e.g., infant mortality, lack of immunization
     against common childhood diseases, and physical abuse, neglect,
     and unintended injury (Carnegie Corporation of New York, 1994;
     McLoyd & Wilson, 1992).

     Moreover, as compared to their nonpoor age-mates, poor youth: Are
     50% more likely to have physical or mental disability; are almost
     twice as likely to have not visited a doctor or dentist in the
     most recent two years of their lives; are 300% more likely to be
     high school dropouts; and are significantly more likely to be
     victims of violence (Simons, et al., 1991). In addition, several
     familial risk factors are associated both with child poverty and
     with a key covariate of poverty--poor school achievement.

     To illustrate, there are three maternal risk factors associated
     with a child's living in poverty and, as well, with him or her
     being in the lower half of his or her school class. These risk
     factors are: (1) The mother has fewer than 12 years of schooling;
     (2) The mother is not married to the child's father; and (3) The
     mother was less than 20 years old when she had her first child.
     These risk factors affect family life and child development. This
     linkage can be illustrated by reference to other 1993 Kids Count
     Data Book information linking these three risk factors to child
     poverty and to school achievement. Among all 7 to 12 year-old
     children living in America, there was a probability of .79 that
     the child would be poor if all three risk factors were present.
     Similarly, the probability of being in the lower half of one's
     school class was .58 if all these three factors were present. In
     turn, when any two of these risk factors were present the
     probability of being poor or of being in the bottom half of one's
     school class was .48 and .53, respectively. The corresponding
     probabilities involving the presence of only one risk factor were
     .26 and .47 respectively. Finally, when none of these risk
     factors were present the probability of 7- to 12-year old
     children being poor or being in the lower half of their class was
     .08 and .30, respectively.

     Across the 1980s, the probability increased that there would be a
     link between child poverty and the presence of maternal risk
     factors. That is, as the poverty rates of America's children
     worsen, exceeding now all other major industrialized nations
     (Huston, 1992), the structure of the family is also changing in
     ways that have placed poor children and parents at greater risk
     of problems of family life and individual development. For
     instance, during the 1980s there was a 13% increase in the number
     of children living in single-parent families, a trend present in
     44 states. Thus, during 1987-1991 period, 18.1%, 30% and 56.7% of
     European-American, Latino, and African-American children,
     respectively, lived in single-parent households (Center for the
     Study of Social Policy, 1992). Overall, approximately 25% of
     America's youth live in single parent (and, typically,
     female-headed) families, and poverty rates among female-headed,
     single parent or male-headed, single parent families are much
     higher (46.8% and 23.2%, respectively) than among two-parent
     families (9.0%) (Center for the Study of Social Policy, 1993;
     Hernandez, 1993). Indeed, the poverty rates in singleparent
     households were, by the beginning of the 1990s, 29.8% for
     European American families, 50.6% for African American families,
     and 53% for Latino families (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1991).
     Since the income of female-headed, single-parent households is
     often three or more times lower than two parent households, and
     is also lower than single parent, male-headed households, the
     fact that increasing numbers of children live in these family
     structures means that the financial resources to support
     parenting are less likely to be available (Center for the Study
     of Social Policy, 1993).

     Moreover, in 1990, 90.3% of children were living with their
     parents, 7.3% were living with other relatives, and 2.3% were
     living outside of the family (Center for the Study of Social
     Policy, 1992). However, only 41.9% of African American children,
     67.7% of Latino children, and 78.5% of European American children
     between the ages of 10 and 14 lived with both their parents
     (Simons, Finlay, & Yang, 1991). In turn, between the ages of 15
     and 17, only 41% , 63%, and 76% of African-American, Latino, and
     European American children, respectively, lived in two-parent
     households (Simons, et al., 1991).

     As a means to summarize the costs--not only to youth but, as
     well, to all of America--of pervasive child and adolescent
     poverty, we may note Hamburg's (1992, p. 10) view that:

          Not only are many more children growing up in poverty
          than was the case a decade or two ago, but many more
          are mired in persistent, intractable poverty with no
          realistic hope of escape. They are profoundly lacking
          in constructively oriented social-support networks to
          promote their education and health. They have very few
          models of competence. They are bereft of visible
          economic opportunity. The fate of these young people is
          not merely a tragedy for them, but for the entire
          nation: A growing fraction of our potential work force
          consists of seriously disadvantaged people who will
          have little if any prospect of acquiring the necessary
          competence to revitalize the economy. If we cannot
          bring ourselves to feel compassion for these young
          people on a personal level, we must at least recognize
          that our economy and our society will suffer along with
          them. Their loss is our loss.

Addressing the Crisis of America's Children through Innovative Welfare
Reform Coupled with Creative and Integrative Programming

[Image]

     Given the number of children and families that today are at such
     profound levels of risk, we are faced as a society with a crisis
     so broad that the entire fabric of American society is in serious
     jeopardy (Simons, et al., 1991). With so many of our nation's
     communities facing the likelihood of losing much of their next
     generation to one or more of the several high risk behaviors
     increasingly present among our nation's youth, all of our
     children, whether or not they themselves engage in given risk
     behaviors, nevertheless in effect live in risk--of experiencing
     the adverse economic and employment conditions associated with
     living in a nation that is increasingly globally uncompetitive,
     has a diminished pool of future leaders, offers lowered standards
     of living, requires lower expectations about life chances and, in
     fact, provides fewer and fewer opportunities for healthy and
     wholesome development (Lerner,1993a).

     Simply, America is wasting its most precious resource: The human
     capital represented by its children (Hamburg, 1992; Lerner,
     1993a, 1993b; Lerner & Miller, 1993). And this destruction of
     human capital is a problem that cuts across race, ethnicity,
     gender, and rural or urban environments (Center for the Study of
     Social Policy, 1992, 1993; Simons, Finlay, & Yang, 1991).
     Accordingly, all of us, all Americans, and certainly all of our
     children and adolescents, are now and for the foreseeable future
     confronted by this crisis of youth development. Of course, the
     pervasiveness of this crisis does not diminish the need to
     prioritize our efforts, In fact, results of evaluation studies of
     preventive interventions indicate that great success can occur
     with programs directed to youth and families most in need
     (Dryfoos, 1990, 1994, in press; Hamburg, 1992; Schorr, 1988).
     Nevertheless, the breadth of the problems affecting our nation's
     youth requires that we see the issues we face as pertaining to
     all of us, and not to only a segment or a subgroup of America.

     Unfortunately, however, current public policies, and the programs
     associated with them, have proven insufficient to eradicate the
     growth of behavioral risks and of poverty and its sequelae; as
     such, unless effective policy innovations and new programs are
     introduced American will lose both much of its current generation
     of adults and an even larger proportion of the next generation.
     Given the economic and social calamity that such loss will
     engender, it is clear that public policies pertinent to poor
     people must be reconceptualized and redesigned, and that
     innovative and effective youth- and family-serving programs must
     be coupled with these policy changes in order to create and
     sustain the changes in youth and families that will be requisite
     if America is not to fall over the precipice of generational
     destruction.

     Thus, welfare reform and creative programming must be seamlessly
     combined to address this urgent national problem. As such, we now
     discuss the key policy issues to which welfare reform must speak
     and to delineate the ways in which Extension--with its existing
     youth- and family-serving programs or with new programming
     initiatives it will undertake--possesses the capacity to be the
     outreach arm of reformed welfare policies focused on the diverse
     needs of our nations children and families.

I think E-Prime fails to solve the problem, and even exacerbates it
by making people think they can avoid fuzzy thinking by playing
silly word-games with a broken language instead of doing actual work
to think and communicate more clearly.

The fact that our language evolved to give a central role to a
certain device that makes muddy thinking easier is curious (note
that "inspires curiosity" would be legal E-Prime but even more
sloppy, and "is curious to me" is illegal but clearer).  Those
that created English apparently /needed/ to think muddily, and
it is /that/ which we should try to understand (I could reword
that sentence without the "is", but it would have been less
clear and no more meaningful).

I'm all for language reform--I love Lojban, I created genderless
pronouns for the Oceania Constitution, and I like to think I take
some care to use my native tongue effectively.  I'm all for
introducing people to ideas like E-Prime, but let's not rely on
it as a substitute for actual rational thinking.

I don't understand where you get that idea from.  Everyone in ExI I deal with
has taken personal responsibility to put theories into action.  Most of them
work all day at extropic jobs.  I do.  Some produce Extropian artworks, some
write books about new technology that have stimulated creativity and
invention,  some are setting the framework for new social systems and
experimenting with them.  There is a brain drug clinical trial protocol being
written.  There are people working on improving computer systems hardware and
software, as well as research into cell injury repair and cryonic suspension.
 There are many other examples.  We are in for the long haul not the quick
fix.  Most of these activities will take decades to achieve societal impact. 
 
The non-fiction books on the ExI reading list are all practical as far as
I've read -- the nutritional supplement books in particular have dozens of
resources for the drugs.  Even the philosophical books are highly practical.
 I can think of many times they influenced my decisions.  Advancing
philosophy is a step forward in making me a better future person.  Just think
of how pan critical rationalism and Churchland's books can be used on a daily
basis.   
 
Why object to the speculative fiction books and ideas of Extropy?  They are
there to make me more creative.  They stimulate my mind into producing
something useful.  I would not be so involved in nanotechnology advancement
if it where not for Ed Regis and K. Eric Drexler.  Both of them were found
through ExI.  I now work with AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy) manufacturers.
  From science fiction -------> to science reality -------> to technological
reality.  That's how it works.  This is very practical in that SF leads to a
change of societies mind from fear of technology ------->  to accepting the
possibility  ------->  to developing the technology  ------->  to using the
technology. 
 
BEST DO IT SO principles are all practical as far as I can see.  Take Dynamic
Optimism for example:  That's a way of life in its self.  The greatest force
against scientific and technology is pessimism (only looking at the fear
aspect) and that leads to depression.  Depression is where a person is
mentally paralyzed from doing anything worthwhile.  Anything at all in fact.
 These poor people can't even get out of bed in the morning.   
 
If you just take one of the principles at a time, e.g. Self-Transformation,
and follow the "how to's" advice in the Extropy article(s) _that_ might be
enough make things more practical to you.  I like "DO" (do . . . how
appropriate) Dynamic optimism, myself.   
 
You are right, I book "So You Want To Be An Extropian -- A How To Manual"
would be valuable.  If you want to do something practical, compile and write
this book, (before I do).   For now,  I like Sarah Marr's web site:

One aspect of the extropian philosophy that I am particularly fond, is the
fact that it provides practical information that can be applied to every day
life, as well as far-future concepts.

The ideas in this thread are part and parcel to actively being extropian.
Being an extropian is a commitment to one's own individual growth and
development=97near as well as long term.  By commitment, I mean an actual
conscious decision to be responsible for one's self (or selves).  Whereas
our being transhuman is an like being part of an "evolutionary stampede,"
our being extropianism can be achieved in a systematic and pragmatic way.

The theories in achieving same are explained quite carefully in extropian
texts which have been published and offer precise information about how to
apply these practical concepts to one's life.

The full editions of _Extropy_ magazine can provide you with such a resource
guide.  It is amazing how rich and resourceful it actually is.  It might
some day in the near future by referred to as an encyclopedic reference for
transhumanism.

E-prime generally helps with clarity and honesty.  It bars passive voice
(mistakes were made) and unsubstantiated generalizations (people are dumb).
 You can certainly get around these obstacles, but at least e-prime makes you
think about actors, assertors, and evidence.  When I write in e-prime, I tend
to have to mention actors, assertors and evidence, and that makes my writing
easier to understand and harder to misunderstand.

If you *want* to hide the actors, assertors, or evidence, you certainly can.
 You often have to use expressions even harder to understand than the passive
voice you avoided in the first place.  Still, using e-prime encourages zip
and clarity.

I think a "Practical Extropian Resource Guide" would be a good thing.  It would help 
extropians and other people find what they want (if it exists) much faster.

I'm going to compile a list of resources that I find relevant to the extropian ideal of 
self-transformation.  I'll surf the Web in search of information and will accept URLs 
that people will send me.

However, since I'm quite busy these days, I'll probably unsubscribe from this mailing 
list at the end of this week (I can't keep up with all the messages I get from all the 
mailing lists I'm on).  You will still be able to send me URLs at 
<litenite@game-master.com>.  Also because I'm busy, don't expect my compilation to be 
extremely voluminous nor present on the Web before the end of the month.

I agree that using E-Prime or [shameless plug] Lojban can often enlighten.
The message to which I replied suggested far more than merely using E-Prime
as an interesting exercise, but actually proposed that we point out postings
here that violated it.  I suggest we do something far more valuable: point
out actual sloppy thought, however expressed, and applaud clear thought,
however expressed.  "To be" and passive voice can be used quite properly
and effectively (as in this sentence where omitting the actor is quite
deliberate to imply a general rule), and I make no apologies for either.

Yes, most papers are hard to understand even for the experts, especially

Well, that would likely convince you about some of the substances, but it 
would not be a valid test and it would not really tell us anything about 
how well they actually work (we need blind testing for that). Of course, 
it is much better than reading the hype and believing it.

Yes, and nicotine is still one of the best researched substances. That it
has nootropic effects appears quite clear, but these effects are quite
complex and not all positive. In general, the idea of nootropics only
having positive cognitive effects and no side-effects is *very* unlikely,
although some drugs likely will be able to come close in some respects. 
After all, if a substance improved my working memory at the expense of
perception, I might be interested in using it anyway under certain
conditions.

Well, it is your money and body. But I think it is stupid to not attempt 
to find out more about what you try to use before using it - after all, 
most of the claims are quite unfounded, and there are some dangers even 
in quite safe supplements.

Me too. But I would likely turn into one of the gargoyles in _Snow Crash_ :-)

Yes, this seems to be a nice idea. I am not entirely sure this can't be 
done using a microphone taped to the throat or something similar, but it 
might be useful for some people.

I don't know if anybody has done it, but I will look into the subject. 
The big problem is having leads penetrating the skin, that is a real mess 
and somewhat dangerous. It might be possible to send signals through 
telemetry instead (like some pacemakers do). An even more ambitious 
version would be an implant that read cortical activity and sent it to a 
receiver; it *might* be possible to get useful information from that, but 
I'm not sure.

	From the strict definition of the word, coercion, Extropians use coercion
as well as anyone else.  Exploiting anothers' fear is coercion; fear of
being ostracized is but one way they coerce others to "fall in line". 
However, it might be more accurate to say they do not believe in initiating
force.  Enforcement of laws under an Extro-Society would not violate this
principle since all laws would have victims.  The offender would then be
the initiator of force and the victim, having a contract with an
enforcement agency (private of course), would have the right to respond
through this agent of theirs.  That, is how they would enforce their
rights.  Writing about rights, we believe there is only one right...the
right to life.   Rights to property, health, and liberty all derive from
this single right.  If another can control our property (taxes, etc.) they
can deprive us of life, the same for health and liberty.  To interfere with
anothers' life would be the only crime.  And certainly we all recognize the
right to use force, if necessary to prevent someone from killing us, no
matter how slowly they are doing it.

The hardest thing for me with a vegan diet is maintaining it whilst
remaining sociable. Peer criticism was also harsher and harder to deal
with than I ever imagined. The age old argument always surfaces; 'you are
missing out on protein and vital nutrients'.

Is there anything that a vegan is in danger of missing? Do I need to
suppliment my diet, or are there naturally occuring provdiders?


As far as Practical Exropianism goes:

Nootropics

I recomend Ginko Biloba (2x260mg twice a day). It stays in your system for
6-8 hours and I have found that it greatly benefits cognition, memory,
concentration etc. If not convinced, make a smart drink with 6x260mg and
really notice the difference. I was flying all day and completed a several
thousand word paper in 4 hours, the grade?, 96 per cent.

Quitting smoking

I found chewable vitamin C tablets to be a nice alternative. Every time I
crave, I just pop a tab. Obviously the effects are totally different
(completely opposite healthwise) but the tablet simply serves as a
reminder of my commitment to move towards better health. Oh yeah, and
drink plenty of water......

I got the following digest from TheeDataBase, an e-zine. The mag used to
be great but now I am not so sure. Any comments on the predictions that
follow?

I personally doubt an 'artificial brain' will be possible in 2037. Have
British Telecom gone absolutely mad?


M.



Forward: POSSIBLE FUTURES


British Telecom's last set of technological predictions prepared us for
data chips stored in our heads that were downloadable upon death.  Last
week, BT's Applied Research and Technologies department presented us with
the sci-fi scenario of a cat that would book taxis on our behalf.  Not
quite as essential as life after death, but for the couch-conscious of the
world, it may be seen as the best step forward.

The predictions can be chronologically listed as follows (commentary by
BT's Head of department, Ian Pearson) :

1999 : man-made blood and artificial pancreas will be available to
patients.  We will also be "talking to our fridges" by introducing an email
pager that you talk to, with a magnet on the back to attatch to
aforementioned refridgerator.
2007 : we will be carrying "personal health monitors" to warn us before we
become ill.
2010 : artificial cats and dogs will be introduced
The robot "cat" is already here and living in Pearson's kitchen.  "It would
not take much to add robotic legs and furry covering and replacing the
insides with a radio link to a pwerful computer.  The cat could then be
your personal butler, booking taxis, doing your home shopping and sorting
out your accounts."
2015 : a bionic man will artifical legs will be a reality
"because of advances in processing speed and memory storage, computers wil
be more intelligent and creative than man in 2015.  By 2025 we will be able
to read what the brain is thinking and feed information into it to
supercede learning."
2020 : Property values become so high that complete underground cities are
constructed, serviced by computerised appliances that will recognise our
desires by body language.
2030 : other artifical organs will be available such as lungs, kidneys,
liver and "senses"
2037 : artifical brain invented
"we will have minimised all technologies so that a computer the size of the
brain, but more powerful and able to control the human body, could be used
in brain transplants."
(data sourced from Daily Telegraph, 26.4.97)

Re-read what I wrote carefully.

An anarchocapitalist society has two kinds of territory: unclaimed and
private. Presumably most territory on the planet would be claimed, so
we can ignore unclaimed for the moment.

Claimed (or private) areas come in many flavors. For example, there
are closely held private areas, such as the interior of a person's
home. There are "cooperative" areas, such as the common areas of a
private gated community, which are often not open to members of the
general public. There are "private areas open to the public", such as
a large park run by a private conservancy organization, which any
member of the public may, generally speaking, enter. There are, of
course, numerous other spaces.

When I noted that one might be contractually oblidged not to go nude
within common areas of a contractual community, I was thinking
specifically of the case of the common areas of a gated private
development or other areas not open to the general public. I was not
thinking of areas such as a private park open to members of the
general public.

While it is possible for the owners of such spaces to obligate those
entering them to wear particular clothing or even specific kinds of
clothing, I am unsure about what societal norms are likely to arise in
such spaces, and thus what sorts of obligations are likely to be
common, and in any case the question is one more of sociology than
law.

Certainly.

> I would predict that in most common areas, nudity would be illegal.

I'm not certain that this would be the case, though then again, I'm
not sure it wouldn't be, either. My suspicion is that many areas open
to members of the general public would not prohibit nudity. I base
this suspicion on the notion that since at least some would likely
permit it, social norms sanctioning this behavior would erode with
time. I have no solid evidence for this notion, however.

"Illegal" is a bad word, btw -- contractually forbidden is perhaps
better.

I hope you mean "sanction tasteless behavior" rather than enforcing
it. :)

> That is, most people are willing to pay more to have nudity go away
> than the potential nudists are willing to pay to parade around nude.

I'm not sure. I suspect (again, without more than a hunch) that as
people become more exposed to exposed people, the amount they will pay
to be free of them would erode with time. People are happy to have a
social norm enforced if they don't have to pay (at least directly) to
do so, but they are less happy to do so if they would have to pay.

> locations, where common nudity is legal.  

I would tend to agree, but again, based purely on personal suspicion.

No, but the newspapers are uncritical. The artificial brain (the "Soulsucker 
2000 Chip") was intended as a dramatic and humoristic ending of their 
talk, but some journalists thought it was reality, and then other 
journalists copied them, and so on.

The artificial pancreas is underway, and the email pager practically 
exists (it just has to become cheaper; think ubiquitious computing).

Sounds hard to implement without direct access into the bloodstream - not
entirely advisable but perhaps doable. I would implement it as a biosensor
chip implanted beneath the skin on the left arm so that a combined
clock/monitor could communicate with it and measure temperature, blood
pressure and chemical balance. Not entirely reliable, but probably useful.

The household robot - it is always 20 years into the future, just like 
fusion. But agents are here, and seeing them as pets and animals rather 
than servants might be an useful metaphor. 

> 2015 : a bionic man will artifical legs will be a reality

Well, we can already make myoelectric legs. I assume that by 2015 they 
finally become useful if we can develop battery technology far enough 
(this is the current limiting factor - would you trust a leg that could 
give out after a few hours use?).

Lot's of assumptions, but Hans Moravec agrees.

Underground cities are more expensive to build than skyscraper cities and 
arcologies. Devices reacting to body language are being researched today 
(affective computing, see the MIT Media Lab).

A conservative estimate. It is likely that at least the liver will be 
based on real cells, perhaps cloned or from animals.

And thus, an urban legend was born. The fact it stuck, however, must mean
there is some human desire for it to be true.

How true is the old adage that a computer can only be as clever as the
programmer who designed it? How far has self-learning computing
progressed? Any books recomended?

Nope, u can get more protein from beans than from meat.  Vegan diet gives you
so much nutrition its crazy.  The only thing better is a noncooked,, organic,
living foods diet.  I go for milk too though.  Proper food combining is a
must too, drink water before eating fruit before veggies before grains.
You know what the worst food combination is?  Meat and potatoes.  The
chemicals in each cancel out the digestive chemicals in your stomach,
becoming undigestibabl and rotting in your stomach and intestines for a day
like it was sitting in the hot sun.

B12 is probably the only thing you can't get from a vegan diet,
but you don't need much--it's likely you'll get enough just from
the things you don't check out carefully (the occasional baked
good with egg or gelatin or milk).  Most vegans take supplements
but probably don't need to.  Protein is not a problem, and the
old Lappe nonsense about carefully mixing protein sources to get
"balanced" amino acid levels has been debunked, so there's
nothing inherently wrong with a vegan diet.

But, since there is actually no valid evidence that a vegan diet 
is better than a more well-rounded low-fat diet, I think it would
be negligent to recommend it to anyone except for religious
reasons.  I am a lacto-veg myself, but I don't go out of my way
to ask every restaurant if they use a little lard in their beans
or gelatin in their desserts.  It just isn't worth the effort
for unproven gains.

A thread with the above subject, Mar 22 -31, helped me think as I worked
on a paper on the same topic, a draft of which is now available at:

   http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/calibration.ps

I had mentioned theoretical results which indicated that Bayesians
can't have persistent disagreements.  In my research I focused on the
critique that such models require far too much computational abilities
of their agents, and generalized the result to highly computationally
constrained agents.  Here is a title and abstract:

      "Disagreements are about Computation, Not Information".
       
  Consider two agents who want to be Bayesians with a common prior, but
  who can not due to computational limitations.  If these agents agree
  that they can reason abstractly about the fact that they have these
  limitations, then they can only agree to disagree about their estimate
  of a random variable if they agree to disagree (to a similar degree)
  about both their average biases.  Yet average bias can in principle be
  computed independently of any agent's private information.  Thus
  disagreements must be fundamentally about computation, rather than

Clearly. And I think the discussions on this list is good evidence that

No, it is a fallacy which is surprisingly common. The oldest and most 
obvious counterexample is IMHO Samuel's checker program, which was 
significantly better than him. I'm constantly amazed (and dismayed) by 
what the neural networks I play with do, and sometimes they come up with 
obvious solutions to problems I did not think of. 

> How far has self-learning computing progressed? 

Depends on what kind of learning you refer to. I don't know enough about 
classical AI, but EURISKO-style heuristic competition is quite similar to 
genetic algorithms, a field where there is plenty of exciting results. 
Neural networks learn fine, but we still have to find good input 
representations and architectures for them.

That's bogus.  If the software I write doesn't end up smarter than I am,
I'll be in trouble come salary review time.  Not smarter in general, of
course-- but smarter at the tasks people will buy it for.  

>How far has self-learning computing

It's charging right along.  There are plenty of people out there making
money from machines learning how to do stuff, and plenty more people in
universities and research labs coming up with new methods.  I used to be in
the second category, and am now trying to be in the first.  There seems to
be about a ten-year gap between development and commercial deployment,
because that's how long it takes to know if a technique isn't a loser.

We're still a long way from 'general-purpose intelligence'.  The present
state of the commercial art is to point a program at a database of a bunch
of stuff that's happened in the past, and then ask it what's the best thing
to do in a new situtation.  For example, you might have a database of loan
applications, and whether those people later defaulted on their loans, and
you can ask the program if a given application is likely to be a good one or
a bad one.  That's the level of boringness of typical uses of machine learning.

I'd suggest mentioning how excruciating the agony of heart attack is,
and how much fun hobbling around as a post-stroke paralytic patient
can be, and how much people usually enjoy chemotherapy and how
successful it often is.

I may have an advantage here -- living in New York, I have no trouble
eating anywhere I please, including the fanciest restaurants. Most
places other than steak houses will accomodate my eating preferences,
and there are lots of purely vegan restaurants, too. I imagine things
might be different in parts of Canada.

No, you're missing just about nothing.

B12 might -- *might* -- be difficult for vegans to get naturally. It
is required in grotesquely small amounts -- micrograms per day -- and
the body stores it. Take a vitamin supplement (preferably without
iron) that has B12 in it and you are likely going to get more than
you'll ever need.

Beyond that, remember a couple of things: steer clear of sources of
added fat like oils (no point in being a vegan for health reasons and
frying every meal), and given all the research on sugar I'd try to
steer clear of refined sugars when possible (I do, at least, although
I'm not religious about it). Try to eat a balanced diet, and you
should be fine.

True enough, but I supplement anyway.

There is a problem with this reasoning.

A) Most of the best research on low fat diets and heart disease
has involved low fat vegan diets. You are correct that no evidence
exists that an equally low fat non-vegan diet would not be just as
good, but then again, neither is there evidence that it would.

B) It is far, far harder to maintain very low fat intake levels on
anything but a fairly strict vegan diet. With a strict vegan diet,
simply avoiding a couple of obvious things (i.e. frying everything or
eating lots of avocados) keeps your fat intake levels insanely
low. With a non-vegan diet, you have to take enormous amounts of care,
estimate fat intake on everything you've eaten, etc. The effort is
almost unsustainable. You can probably get below 20% of calories from
fat by keeping close track on a non-vegan diet, but getting much lower
than that requires almost superhuman dedication, and 20% is still
probably far too high. Most vegans achieve substantially lower fat
intake levels than that without any real effort at all. Being able to
avoid thinking about what I'm eating is a real honest win.

> I am a lacto-veg myself, but I don't go out of my way to ask every

As a "vegan for health reasons" I generally don't pay attention to
issues like "is honey vegan" (I don't care about the bees and happily
eat honey, although I usually avoid sweeteners to keep my glucose
levels from surging anyway) and if someone slips me an egg in some
baked good by accident I doubt it will kill me. However, I try my
best, largely so that the occassionaly unexpected surprise actually
will be noise in the food statistics rather than being "just one more
egg won't kill me", if you know what I mean.

Also, I don't do dairy products. Dairy is very high in fat -- a slab
of cheese is much higher in fat than a similar calorie content slab of
lean beef. I might as well be eating meat if I was going to eat cheese
or milk. Besides, at this point, I've become lactose intolerant after enough
years of not eating dairy. It appears most people do -- eating dairy
products isn't something we evolved to do.

So, I'll agree -- yes, in theory, a non-vegan diet can possibly be
just as healthy, and yes, there isn't much point in being insanely
anal retentive about veganism. On the other hand, its actually simpler
being a vegan than trying to watch your diet closely and evaluating
content with a calorie and fat percentage chart at every meal, and
generally speaking, it has very few negatives in my quality of life.

Also, I must say that although it made no obvious difference in my
health when I was younger, as I've gotten older I've noticed that I'm
not gaining weight the way my age peers are, and I seem to be
healthier than them. We'll know for sure in another ten or twenty
years, but I suspect that the experiment is already pretty
successful.

I think you misapply it somewhat; a nootropic need not correspond to any 
reasonable mutation that could occur in nature. In practice you are 
right, the state of our neurochemistry is likely a compromise between 
several opposing factors which is optimal in general, but not in the 
specific and unnatural situations we might want to employ nootropics in.

Not true; there's no B12 and it's a little difficult to get a couple of
minerals like zinc.  In many respect (most vitamins) vegan diets do indeed
tend to be excellent.  Protein is a non-issue; you'll get enough protein from
almost any natural diet.

You should check up on that.  I've yet to see any scientific references on
food combining.

This is horsehockey.  The digestive chemicals in your stomach are
hydrochloric and butyric acid.  Neither meat nor potatoes (nor any other food
you'd eat) will cancel that.  

It's a pity, really.  Calorie restriction is a great way to extend lifespan.
 If all I had to do was to eat meat and potatoes together and nothing would
get digested, I'd be set.

I'm not sure why you think people's preferences regarding nudity would
be very different in the comon areas of a gated private development,
vs. in a private park.  If nudity is prohibited in one are, why
wouldn't it be prohibited in the other as well?

I don't see why we should think expectations regarding preferences on
nudity should be very far out of equilibrium.  I think most people
know what naked bodies look like.  

Also, within a small condo complex, does anything now prevents people
who want nudity from offering to pay an amount to the association to
allow it, thereby lowering other owner's fees?

Erik, it was a bad sign when you ignored the huge difference between East and

you dismissed with a shrug of your shoulders and a wave of you hand the

socialistic paradise for the capitalistic hell of Florida, and they have done 
it in incredibly dangerous home made rafts, some little more than a few inner

Fit For Life explains how that process works, it has to do with acids and
bases I believe.  All foods require a certain counterpart chemical in our
bodies to complete the digestion, and some chemicals can cancel each other
out.

Actually, doing that would probably result in a hospital visit.  That
combination releases tons of waste and harmful byproducts.

Robin Hanson posted about his new paper "Disagreements are about 
Computation, Not Information".

Not being Postscript-enabled, and somewhat mathematically challenged 
(both informational AND computational limitations on my part (-:), I'd 
like to try and understand this a bit better (in English, if 
possible).

<Consider two agents who want to be Bayesians with a common prior, but 
who can not due to computational limitations.>

I suspect this should actually read "a [set of] common prior 
[probabilities]". Or, perhaps, we are failing to communicate due to 
informational limitations (unfamiliarity with terminology on my 
part)?

It seems to me that your discussion must be limited to two experts who 
can agree on the context of the problem being addressed.  An expert 
and a non-expert would not share the common background information 
that would make application to the discussion of additional evidence 
practical with Bayesian techniques.

<If these agents agree that they can reason abstractly about the fact 
that they have these limitations, then they can only agree to disagree 
about their estimate of a random variable if they agree to disagree 
(to a similar degree) about both their average biases.>

Are these computational limitations you speak of the situation where 
one party may not have the time or temperament to perform a complete 
or correct inductive analysis?

Or, is one party simply unfamiliar with the formal analysis approach 
and unable to *formulate* the necessary computation?

If the latter, isn't this, rather, an informational limitation?

On the one hand, with your emphasis on computational limitations, I 
get the feeling that you're agreeing with many of the posters on this 
thread that "common-sense" reasoning would be a different 
computational approach from Bayesian analysis, even if the two parties 
both had the same prior "information".

LDC 970325:
<I will also admit that it is quite possible that the number of 
decisions I make using conscious reasoning is numerically overwhelmed 
by those I make sub-consciously by simply following whatever memes 
happen to floating in the soup.>

Curt Adams 970326:
<The obvious conclusion is that most if not all people do not use even 
a passable approximation of Bayesian inference. I'd say most if not 
all people have their opinions driven by memetic replication (as 
exemplified by fashion and religion) and not a passable Bayesian 
approximation.>

And, more recently on another thread, Steve Witham put it this way:
<you'll be lead into finding that the value (in hypothesized beings) 
that is identical to what you (the analyzer) call success, will be the 
one with the most stability, and everything else might as well be 
coded (in your analysis) as ideas of how to achieve it.>

So, on the other hand, are you trying to show, vis a vis what Curt 
said, that normal "memetic replication" actually *does* end up 
equating to "a passable approximation of Bayesian inference"?

On 970326 you wrote to Lee (regarding his argument that using 
inference to judge whether inference works best is a circular 
argument):
<Come now, your behavior here seems a good example of the error of 
refusing to give any weight to the opinions of others, unless they 
present to you, at your convenience and in a form you can quickly 
understand, all the evidence behind their opinions.>

It seems to me, as well, that sensible people will accept expert 
opinions on some complex subject *only if* it can be presented in a 
context they can understand.  Isn't this a problem of using the 
appropriate level of communication (information) rather than a 
different type of computation (reasoning)?

It's not that I (or the average person) want(s) to ignore expert 
opinions, it is simply that we can not make any use of them if they 
can not put into terms we can understand.  This is why I would tend to 
say that, *in general*, disagreement is a matter of informational 
rather than (or as well as) computational limitations.

The Craving Brain 
by Ronald A. Ruden, Marcia Byalick

Is a book I highly recommend for several reasons. On the personal
level he is the personal Dr. for myself and for Perry Metzger.

It is a very interesting book clearly for the subject matter it covers
but also for the way the information has been presented.

The basic premise of the book is how certain Nuro chemicals can
trigger addiction of any kind. Dr. Ruden takes a very evolutionary
view of things. For example he explains that 12 Step programs work,
basically because they trigger the Nuro chemical response that mammals
and other animals would get when in a "herd;" he may or may not be
correct but it is a more philosophically pleasing answer than it works
because someone invoked their higher power. He also touches on some
things which give sound scientific basis to the Extropian principal of
Dynamic Optimism.

The book is divided into two sections. A very easy to read six
chapters that details Dr. Ruden's Point of View (POV). Then there is
an other six chapters on the very same topics but with a more
scientific approach, far less easy to read but with significantly more
information. The type of information an Extropian might like to sink
his or her intellectual teeth into. I think more books should be
written this way; you get easy to read and you don't have to leave out
any of the hard details.

It is available via WWW.amazon.com and from other fine book sellers.

My model applies to *any* situation where any two agents disagree
about some factual claim, as long as they understand what that claim
means.  They do not need to share any understanding of other context.

I cited a paper which indicated that evolutionary pressures reward
closer approximations to Bayesian reasoning, ignoring the
computational costs.  In situations where those costs are small, then
a passable approximation is expected.  When the costs are large, the
divergence should be larger.  How much larger is hard to say.

Consider debates on the effect of diet on lifespan, on the effect of
capital punishment on murder rates, the effect of military budgets on
deterring war, or on the age of the universe.  Most everyone can
understand what these claims mean, even if they couldn't understand
most arguments about them.  What debates do you have in mind?

I have heard that in Hebrew there is no form of the verb to be.  I'd be
interested in hearing this from someone who speaks the language.  In
addition, are there any other natural languages without a form of to be?

If this was the case then why did we start eating meat in the first
place?  If because it tastes good, *why* do we think meat tastes good?

And I must say, one serving of beans doesn't seem to give anywhere the

Speaking of which, one idea the calorie-restriction people kick around
is whether previous nutritional research, particularly on the benefits
of vegetarianism and low-fatness, were actually studies of mild calorie
restriction.  Is it "fat bad (for some chemical reason)" or "excess
calories bad, and fat translates to lots of calories"?

Recent reading of The Blind Watchmaker have caused me to question
Algernon's Law.  I'll start with an example from nature:

The eye develops first from a sheet of photo sensitive cells, then into a
shallow cup (to better tell which direction the light is coming from).  It
can then become something like a pinhole camera although a balance has to
be struck between focus and the amount of light that comes through (the
smaller the pinhole, the greater the focus but the less the light).  This
remains the case until a lens is added.  Almost any slightly curved
translucent material will do.  The problem comes when we look at the
nautilus.  All studies point to the fact that it could benefit from a lens
on its eye but it does not have one.  The conclusion is that the
embryological development of the nautilus does not allow this simply change
that would be an evolutionary enhancement.

In human beings there could be a similar developmental barrier to
developing some nootropic chemicals. Remember, everything has to evolve by
step by step improvements.

It would be prudent to mention that small quantities of fat are required
for the proper absorption of some minerals.  Dairy fats are an example of
this.  Calcium is poorly absorbed when it is not mixed with small
quantities of appropriate types of fat.  Dairy fats are well-suited for
this role (surprise!) which is one of the reasons it is often better to
drink 1-2% lowfat milk than non-fat.  I have a relative who was a strict
vegan, but was required by her doctor to ingest small quantities of dairy
fats because her body could not adequately absorbing the calcium she was
ingesting both as supplements and in her food.  She started drinking lowfat
milk which subsequently fixed the problem.

There are a few other minerals which are also require minimal amounts of
fat for maximum effectiveness.  Fatty molecules serve many useful purposes
in the body and are a required part of the diet.  The real question isn't
if you should ingest fat, it is what is an appropriate quantity and what
types.  The "all fat is bad" meme is incorrect, or at least misleading.

Quite simple.

1) Media propaganda.
2) Financial support by US secret services -- many exile Cubans indeed
have a better life in the US today. Cubans are among the least likely to
become poor.

I'm not for economic isolation. Nor is communism (see COMECON). And Cuba
is practically isolated today. Yet it has a child mortality of a level
comparable to that of industrialized free market economies (8, if I
remember correctly, and the US got about 7).

I was going to ask, does "understanding what the claim means" imply an 
agreement on the prior probabilities involved in the problem 
statement, or just an agreement on what the terms of the debate are?
(I thought, very simplistically I'm sure, that the essence of a 
Bayesian analysis was that you had these prior probabilities 
describing the likelihood of a particular outcome in some problem 
domain, *that everyone had to agree upon*, and THEN you try to come up 
with a new likelihood estimate, or decision between several options, 
given some additional evidence or arguments.)

BUT, after rereading your abstract, it seems that you're really 
describing how to measure the average bias *between* competing 
evidence or arguments, that is, quantifying the level of disagreement, 
rather than trying to establish the likelihood of either one of the 
individual arguments being correct, or of making a choice between the 
two arguments.

Again, this is all based just on your abstract and my VERY inadequate 
understanding of the subject, so thanks for your helpful response.

No, average bias is the error in a person's estimate of some quantity,
averaged over the possible states of nature.

Dunno, but monkeys eat other monkeys as well as their own kind, not because
they have to though, all their nutrition comes from the plants.  Plus, humans

Rats fed high-fat but low calorie diets do about as well as rats fed low-fat
low-calorie diets.  So the conclusion is that the *primary* health
disadvantage of fat is that it makes you eat more.  Fat may have other
disadvantages wrt heart disease or reproductive cancers (research is
inconclusive; I've seen studies both ways).  With humans there is little
research on the effect of changing fat intake without changing calorie intake
- over a lifetime, these are correlated and very hard to separate.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

We are a community, and this community has different aspects.  We are
a social group, in that we share a history of socializing together and
knowing each other.  And we are a community of commonality: In some
way we are people who share certain values.  In other ways we are
likely people who share certain beliefs.  And we share common
interests in what sorts of new developments elsewhere we'd like to
hear about. 

But in part at least, we are also a research community.  And as such a
community we must share some core open research questions.  These are
questions where we not only want to keep each other abreast of
research done elsewhere, but where our interests and abilities are so
strong that we consider contributing to such research ourselves.  And
where we would likely turn to each other first for criticism and
comments on this research.

I think it would help if we could just collect a list of suggested
research questions.  Then we could talk about which we think are more
interesting and important, so we could create a common impression of
our core questions.  Knowing that our community knows it is interested
in these questions would help inspire people like me to actually go
research those questions.

Here are some that come to mind, biased of course to my interests:

--------------------------------------------------------------
What does the Great Silence tell us about our future chances for expansion?

How does the brain encode long-term information in neurons?  What
devices could read this information with enough accuracy for uploading?

What would be the labor and population economics of a post-upload
world, or a post AI world?

What are the primary causes of economic growth, and how will upcoming
technologies such as nanotech, AI, uploads, WWW, affect growth rates?

What new tech transitions pose the most risk for sudden destabilizing
changes?  How could we best avoid such problems?

How strongly does/will evolutionary pressures change values, and in
what direction?  How plastic are our values now?

Why are we such a minority?  Is it our values or beliefs or
intelligence, or what?  If our beliefs, we can't we persuade others,
and how sure are we that we're not wrong?

Would new institutions, such as fact forums, hypertext debate, or idea
futures help much to persuade others?

How can a cryonics organization remain stable for as long as required?

What are the real limiting factors to large scale space colonization?
E.g., how cheap a launch to get to support energy or mining colonies?

What are the real limiting factors to large-scale crypto?  Do we want it?

What core "constitutional" contract would best support the widest
freedom in private law and elsewhere for a long time?

What would be good private law contracts to consider to deal with:
defense, scale economies, privacy, slavery, marriage, intellectual
property, restitution, pollution, children's rights, etc.?

What now limits freedom?  People's perceptions of how much freedom
they want, or structural failings of our forms of government?

What are the prospects for getting more freedom via intentional
physical communities vs. cyberspace vs. political advocacy?

How should one best define property rights in near solar space?
Can these be profitably sold before "mixing labor with land"?

I think lack of pockets is an excellent example of where personal
morphing justifies itself merely on practical grounds. Having a natural
pocket is an immensely practical feature for an intelligent being, but
on the evolutionary side, could possibly be a detriment to the
development of intelligence. Imagine that having the ability to think
abstractly enough to invent carrying tools like bags or water jugs is a
huge evolutionary filter.

What about coercion of people to fulfill the contracts they have
committed to? One possibility is currently in use in the construction
industry. It is called the bond. Its kind of like placing a bet that you
are going to do what you say you are going to do. This is why you should
only deal with contractors that are bonded, as well as insured.

it all depends on the amount of centrifugal force developed. Obviously
it works or it would not be a useful technique to separate individual
isotopes for nuke production. Additionally, even at one G, our ocean
does have a bit of separation, called the salinocline, which is only
disturbed due to solar derived ocean currents. Blood is a rather
homogenous blend that is centrifuged every day in large quantities for
plasma stockpiles, as well as in minute quantities for lab analysis.

WHile I applaud your appeal to practicality, I might remind you that
many of the inner solar system space projects are now being planned and
funding is being prospected. There are several that could easily take
place within the next ten years. Based on this, I would respectfully
suggest that you reexamine what you regard as practical, near term
extropian goals, projects, and subjects. While personal improvement via
pharmaceuticals or other technology is one goal of ours, remember that
in order to develop the resource base necessary to make such present or
upcoming technologies available to all without destroying our ecology is
much larger than that which is presently available here on earth.
Development of space infrastructure rightfully is a major subject for
extropians to discuss, participate in, and work towards, for this will
make our other dreams that much more possible and affordable.

WHile we occasionally see people here complaining that all we ever do
here is talk, etc., they need to realize that many of us do more than
talk. Many of us are pursuing educations that will be applicable to the
technologies we discuss, or are actively engaged in extropian related
projects.

One thing I have NOT seen or have seen little of, which could probably
be of use, is a directory of active extropian projects. One cause of
this is that extropians tend to be rugged individualists, and aren't
into the joiner mentality. Thus they tend to be involved in individual
projects.

However there are many projects ongoing by non-extropians that fit into
extropian goals. The Artemis Project, First Mellenial FOundation, to
name a few. If there is a need for a project that you see, don't
complain that nobody is doing anything about it. If you think it needs
doing, do it yourself. That is the extropian way.

WHose? The Cuban Government jams all US radio and television boradcasts,
to the point of occasionally interfering in the southern Florida
broadcast market area. Cubans get a banana version of the BBC: 3
channels of government propaganda.

Hah, thats a funny one. We just finished a big operation to stop Cubans
from coming into the country, to the point of holding them in a
concentration camp at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station. Those people
preferred living in a concentration camp to going back to Cuba.

They are the least likely to become poor compared to who? Asian
immigrants far outstrip all other immigrants in terms of educational
attainment and per capita income. Cubans fare better than their Mexican
ethnic cousins for one reason: Cuban refugees are fleeing a government
that supresses their ability to succeed, while Mexicans are attracted to
a welfare system that is much better than their own. Tell me, which type
of immigrant is going to succeed more often?

That is the publicized rate. Never trust the propaganda of communist
governments.

Nor is Cuba practically isolated today. This just goes to show how much
you really know about current events. While the US, its largest and
nearest neigbor has shut off trade, they have rebuilt trade with Mexico,
most of South AMerica, as well as many European and African countries
that don't need or want to kow tow to US gov't demands. Canada is a HUGE
partner with Cuba, and is the biggest propagandizer of the campaign
against Helms Burton, because Canadian companies are making major bank
in the Cuban fire sales of seized properties. Canada is the big hypocrit
here. People wonder why we dont pursue the same policies with regard to
China, N. Korea, and Cuba. Its obvious that China and N Korea never
seized anywhere near the same level of assets as the Cubans did.

Much like we humans have reached the limit of  the brain case size which
can safely be passed through the birth canal. I think that we may need
to induce a mutant gene which turns the hip bone to cartelage during
late pregnancy in order to jump start evolution in this area at least.
Possibly a gene for a larger birth canal and bigger hips.

The important development I think though is not in intelligence, but in
longevity of that intelligence. With senility/alzheimers being
relatively guarranteed for all senior citizens at one level or another,
and considering that we are seeing that the body's own production of
nutrients like DHEA, seratonin, melatonin, etc. all fall off with age, I
think that developing a mutation that can be spliced into living beings
via viruses that will prevent this fall off phenomenon will be the
biggest enhancement to human ability. No matter what our abolute IQ, we
seem to be constantly getting "smarter" as we learn more through life.
If we can extend the lifespan of this ability to learn we can reach new
peaks of insight at much later points in life.

Business is the tail that wags the government's dog in Japan. The level
of intervention in Japan is more in line with a mercantilist/syndicate

North Korea was a hell hole even at the peak of Soviet and or Chinese

All Helms-Burton does is pursue the enforcement of property rights of
former Cuban citizens. The seizure of their property was and still is
unjust and is a major violation of many people's Constitutional and UN
Human Rights. Non-Americans are hypocritically opposed merely for their
own self interest, as they are buying up formerly private property at
firesale prices from the tyrants who confiscated them. Property owners
have an internationally recognized right to be compensated by the new
owners for the property or to have that property returned.

Helms BUrton is also rather mild, as all it does is not allow executives
and executives' families of corporations that purchase illegally seized
property without copmensating the rightful owners to enter the US. Wah,
wah, you can't go skiing at Vail or visit Disney World, too damn bad.

Algernon's Hypothesis (sorry, it han't been around long enough) says
nothing about the ability of an individual to increase her/his
intelligence, nor does it place any limits on the magnitude of an
increase.  Algernon simply states that a person with such an enhancement
will put the fitrness of their genes at risk.  Genes, remember, are the source
of many limits we extropians seek to overcome.  As an extropian, the fitness of
my genes is a non-issue, if not an annoyance.  Just b/c my genes suffer as
my intelligence expands does not mean I do.

I heard something exciting on the radio:  some Japanese scientists apparently have 
elaborated a neural interface to cockroaches' brains.  They plan on using the 
(remote-controlled?) bugs to inspect places where humans can't go.

Does someone have any more information on this particular case or on neural interfaces 
in general?

That question isn't meaningful.  The appropriate question is "In other
languages, how are the various meanings that we express using 'to be'
expressed, and in what ways are they better/worse than English?"

"To be" is used for dozens of different purposes in English, most of
them (but not all) less clear than alternatives.  For example, how does
it express set membership ("I am a human"), inherent and transient
properties ("I am tall, I am hungry"), metaphor (I am a quivering mass
of Jello"), progressive tenses ("I am running"), etc.  "Passive voice"
applies only to positional languages, but other forms of omission or
elision of modals exists in most (even Lojban, only there every such
elision is unambiguous as to what is elided and why).

Progressive tenses are legal even in E-Prime, so it's the others that
really matter; in particular set membership and elision of modals.
That's where much of what general semanticists complain about resides,
because set membership implies generalization without always saying so.
Generlization is a completely worthwhile, valuable act of cognition,
but it is often abused.  Elision is particularly abusable, and while
it can be used to aid expressiveness, it is more often used to avoid
it.  In English, one can often use passive voice with "to be" to elide
modals, but the question is not whether other languages have "to be";
the question is can they elide modals, and how common is it?

Any theologist who has studied the Bible can tell you that Hebrew is
every bit as capable of ambiguity and deception as English, whatever
forms are used.

I'm also not sure it is valid.  It is a common fallacy in thinking about
evolution to suggest that it can produce anything.  There are two
limitations to those things that evolution can produce. One is that
everything has to come about through step by step changes, each step
providing an advantage for survival.  The second is really a more specific
form of the first.  Development has to permit the change. I'll use the eye
again.  
	The photo receptors in the eye are wired backwards.  The part of the cell
that receives light is located behind the nucleus and the mitochondria and
the dendrite(?) the sends the data to the optic nerve.  This results in
(most likely very slight) reduction in vision.  The current eye that we
have now is so ingrained in the genome that there could be no change of
this magnitude because it would conflict with other developmental
processes.

Hello,

	Well, if I could know how you mean with south of Mexico, maybe I could
help you, I'm living close to Mexico City, usually understood as the
central zone of our country, but ....

	Finally, if you mean Oaxaca State or Chiapas State, the suothest states
of my country, or maybe Quintana Roo (Cancun), I know some people who
lives there...

	Best Regards

	Hugo de la O

Yes .. 
    Last summer I attended a program at McGill University, here in Montreal,
for high school students interested in science. We visited various
scientific departments, as well as sites off campus. One of the dept's we
visited was I believe physiology or biology, where they were doing
experiments with snails. Since snails are myogenic, meaning their organs
still function outside of their body, they actually had a snail, minus skin,
splayed out on a sheet of lucite, still quite alive. They said that snails
have a very small amount of neurons (like under 1000), it would be possible
to create a remote controll snail. 
What's interesting about this is that small organisms with simple brains can
have some very advanced structures (like dragonflies' eyes) so it would be
possible to interface those biological apparatti to computers...

Subject: BUG - Cyborg Roaches a Reality

I am not making this up. An article entitled "Robo-Roach Goes On the Prowl"
appeared in the Jan 13 edition of the Louisville, KY Courier Journal. It
was written by Eric Talmadge of the Associated Press and described a cyborg
roach created by the bio-robot team at Tokyo University. The roach was
"surgically implanted with a micro-robotic backpack that allows researchers
to CONTROL ITS MOVEMENTS" (emphasis mine, naturally). There is even a PHOTO
of this cyborg roach. In order to create this thing, the bio-robot
scientists gas a regular American roach (Perplaneta americana) with carbon
dioxide, then remove its wings and antennae. Pulse-emitting electrodes are
then implanted in place of the antennae, and the robot backpack is placed
where the wings used to be. When the roach awakens from this micro-surgery,
the researchers can send signals to the backpack, stimulating the
electrodes which in turn guide the roach's movements. The backpacks only
weigh one-tenth of an ounce, but cockroaches can carry up to 20 times their
own weight -- about one-twentieth of an ounce. The researchers noted that a
backpack-fitted roach can survive for several months but that it also
becomes less sensitive to the electrode-induced commands -- a potential
problem for lengthy "missions."

Now imagine modern microsurveillance technology combined with this cyborg
roach technology. Now be afraid. Can we safely bet that cyborg animals will
be far away, now that cyborg roaches have been created? What about cyborg
humans?

Just some thoughts to ponder.

I think maybe he meant that Western media propaganda about Cuba paints
such a gloomy picture of Cuba that nobody wants to go to Cuba.  Which is
possibly one of the flimsiest rationalisations anyone's ever offered for
anything on this mailing list, apart from that hydrogen powered car

I know this will probably provoke a flameway, but FFL is a joke.  The writers
don't even have the understanding necessary to pass a one-year college bio
class (quite literally, example below).

Yes indeedy they "explain" it.  One needs acid, the other base, when the two
are produced together in the digestive tract, they cancel and neither works.

The problem with this "explaination" is that not one, but *both* of the
primary premises are wrong.  *Both* starch and protein require *both* acid
and base for normal digestion, but the acids and the bases are produced in
different places and do not interfere with each other.  To be technical,
digestion is primarily performed by *neither* acid nor bases, but by neutral
enzymes.  

Briefly, food is eaten, gets churned in the strongly acidic stomach for a few
hours, is passed into the duodenum where the acids are neutralized, and then
is passed to the slightly basic small intestines where digestive enzymes
(amylase for starch, protease for protein) do their work.  Whether you eat
starch, protein, or a mixture thereof, you get the same process.  The stomach
is always acid and the intestines always basic.  This whole shebang is in any
introductory biology course or text.

Incidentally, the intestines are very mildly basic and the base there
wouldn't digest anything.  Some people take drugs to suppress stomach acid
production and digestion works just fine for them.  In other words, when the
body produces neither digestive acids nor digestive bases, food gets digested
anyway.  However, if you block the digestive enzymes (e.g. starch blockers)
food doesn't get digested.  

In spite of the terror the food combining folks display towards undigested
food, it doesn't have many really bad effects.  Fiber is undigested food and
the effects of eating lots of food you can't digest is just the same as that
of eating too much fiber (beans, say) - gas, bloating, and sometimes mild
diarrhea.  You don't need to go to the hospital, just to the bathroom and
your underwear drawer.

You would think that people writing books on nutrition would know that the
stomach and the intestines are separate organs, that one is always acidic and
the other always basic.  You'd think that people writing books on nutrition
would now what happens to food not fully digested.  But you'd be wrong.

Don't be silly.  People eat meat and potatoes all the time and the only time
it makes them go to the hospital is if the meat is already spoiled.

Hi Natasha,
     I would like to go to Mexico, and if you need me to pick up something,
it will give me all the more reason to go.  If it's just over the boarder, I
may go next weekend, or at least very "soon".  If you need my assistance,
just let me know.  You could also leave a voicemail at (818) 810-3228, if you
wish.  Shawn

P.S.  I didn't make it to the Extropian dinner this month, but I plan to make
it next month.  Thanks.

Hunter-gatherers could not cultivate any plants, so they had to find 
nourishing vegetables by gathering them. This means that beans and other 
high-nutrient vegetables could not be relied on for food, especially out 
of season. Humans are opportuntistic omnivores (like many other animals; 
sheep seem to enjoy eating eggs and young birds if they can find the 
nests) and use all available sources of nutrition, both plants and 
animals (hence our multi-purpose set of teeth). 

We like fat and sugars because they were rather scarce in the past - if 
you found them, eat them by all means, because you'll never know when 
you'll find more food. This is the reason most people love chocolate: 
fat, sugar, minerals and some psychoactive compunds at once.

I did start that for the Extropy Institute web page, but it certainly needs
development. If some appropriate person were in charge of that, the ExI web
site would be a great place for a detailed project list, with summaries and
features on projects appearing in ExI's newsletter Exponent.

Also the bad affects of a diet high in fats and sugars doesn't really kick
in till well after mean life-expectancy of paleolithic people.
Cardiovascular disease and cancer weren't really  big killers in the 50000
years ago. You were much more likely to die of starvation than
over-indulgence.

I don't see how you come to this conclusion based on facts you give. I used
to have a diet relatively high in fat and I found that fat satisfied my
hunger rather than stimulated it. Wouldn't it be simpler to say that these
studies show that there is a health advantage gained by having a low
*quantity* of fat in your diet: you can achieve this either by having a low
proportion of fat in a high calorie diet, or a large (or low) amount of fat
in a low-calorie diet.

I also thought that studies showed that the life-extension properties of a
low calorie diet went we beyond just having a low quantity of fat in your
diet; say the difference b/w living to 90 on a low-fat diet and 130 on a
low-calorie diet (i.e. low-fat helps you reach your max. life span,
low-calorie actually slows the aging process and thus extend your life span
significantly).

Can anyone clarify this?

I live in the equivalent of a private gated community right now -- a
multibuilding cooperative apartment complex. The rules of behavior in
common areas are extremely restrictive, largely to prevent residents
from disturbing each other's quiet enjoyment of their homes.

A park, on the other hand, is not directly near someone's home. Given
that the reasons for the high levels of restriction in the gated
community do not exist in the park and other areas, I suspect that the
rules will be different -- the balance of the demands of the competing
interests being different.

Note that this is just a hunch -- we both could be wrong in some way
that we couldn't predict in advance. Human behavior is very complex.

I disagree partially. I think you are correct that most people are
familiar with what naked bodies look like, at least theoretically, but
I disagree that people are *used* to what naked bodies look like.

I base this on personal experience. Before I took life drawing classes
(that is, took classes in which one spent several hours drawing a nude
model), I eroticized the human body to a much greater extent. Exposure
to nude bodies, week after week, posed in banal positions and being
forced to view them analytically to draw them, desensitized me to the
nude form. I've noticed that my own degree of body modesty and "body
shock" (that is, surprise at seeing a nude form) dropped dramatically
as a result of this experience.

This should not be surprising. To the Victorians, who rarely saw a
naked ankle, even the sight of an ankle was a charged experience. To
those who see the naked form repeatedly, it becomes uninteresting or
even banal.

Indeed, one might note that the degree of bodily exposure considered
"uninteresting" in our society has dropped radically over the last
century. We now are at the point where people practically go with
only ritual coverage of their reproductive organs in sufficiently warm
weather, as one example. This was unthinkable in Victorian times. I
believe that our shock at such things has eroded from exposure,
leading us to no longer notice it (much as I lost much of my shock at
nudity). It is not unreasonable to assume that the existance of places
open to the general public at which large numbers of people were
"routinely" unclothed would lead to further erosion of current
societal norms on body modesty as fewer and fewer people noticed or
eroticized nudity qua nudity.

No, nothing does, but then again, demand is fairly low at the moment,
and people do not use the common areas of such communities very much,
which is one of the reasons people such as me happily tolerate
draconian restrictions on activities within them.

Again, all of this is merely informed speculation. I could very well
be wrong about it, or the future impact could be radically different
from what either of us envision. Its hard to tell. There are far too
many variables, and its hard to assess them all.

Ah yes, the Diamonds (thats the name of the husband and wife team that
wrote that book).

I've read part of the book in question (my mother had a copy), and
I've also read a bunch of stuff about what they wrote. Suffice it to
say, it doesn't appear that they have any real solid evidence for
their claims, which tend to be somewhat bizarre. Refering to them as
"researchers" would be a stretch -- they did no real original
research, except on their own bodies.

On the other hand, one could do far worse than following part of their
advice and becoming vegetarian, even if they don't advise doing so for
anything like the correct reasons. Just as you can be cured by
antibiotics even if you believe they are magic that drives out evil
spirits, you can gain advantage from a proper diet even if you do it
for the wrong reasons. The food combining nonsense they spout is
silly, but ultimately harmless even if followed -- at worst, it would
force you to inconveniently juggle what you eat and when.

Of course it isn't true. We evolved in an environment in which food
was scarce and most humans were undernourished. Our ancestors ate meat
whenever they could get their hands on it (which was rare) because
they ate *any* food they could get their hands on. Meat is pretty good
if you are hungry -- its a very concentrated source of nutrients. Even
for people as recently as a century ago in our own culture, meat was
not an everyday thing to find on one's plate.

However, we no longer are living in conditions where food is scarce
and any source of nutrition we can find is to be jumped at. We suffer,
if anything, from overnutrition in our country, with obesity being a
serious cultural concern. We evolved to be able to take advantage of
meat on the rare occassions it was presented to us, but now find
ourselves in conditions where we can eat it every day at every meal if
we so choose. We also evolved, I will point out, with bodies that were
expecting diets that were, for the most part, high in fiber and low in
concentrated protein and fat.

We have thus started to gain all sorts of health problems from eating
a diet we didn't evolve for. We love getting protein because our
ancestors couldn't get enough -- but we get so much more than we need
that it aids and abets osteoporosis. We leap at the chance to consume
fatty foods, given brains programmed to try to get every calorie they
can -- but our bodies aren't tuned for consuming high levels of fat
every day, and although they do a heroic job coping with it, we end up
with heart disease, cancer, and other illnesses as a result. Our
digestive tracts are happy dealing with meat occassionally -- but
forced to cope with low residue foods every day, our long intestinal
tracts, not evolved for such a diet, end up developing unpleasant
problems up to and including colon cancer.

People often ask me "so, if you feel that its okay to eat meat
occassionally and just not every day, why are you such a strict
vegetarian?"

Well, for me, it just simpler to live by a simple rule. This way, I
don't have to try to keep track of how much meat I'm consuming or when
or figure out whether I'm overdoing it, etc. I needn't calorie count,
fat track, or otherwise check over what I'm eating -- I just follow
some simple rules and I'm fine. Given that I know myself well enough
to know that I couldn't obsessively track my dietary intake, this is a
win for me.

I recommend vegan diets largely because they prevent having to deal
with issues of tracking consumption, but for those people who feel
comfortable logging everything they eat, I certainly do not think
there is anything wrong with it -- it just isn't for me.

Sure, but its nearly impossible *not* to get enough fat from your
diet. The amount of needed fat is a tiny fraction of the fat most
people take in. Vegan diets do have fat in them -- plenty in fact --
they just don't have it in the concentrated amounts found in meat or
dairy products. This is not a bad thing, given how much fat most
people overconsume.

Calcium is an interesting specific case. It turns out that most vegan
diets contain much less calcium than non-vegan diets -- it also turns
out that most vegans have substantially lower rates of osteoporosis
than non-vegans. In fact, the highest levels of calcium intake in the
world are among the Innuit, who consume an almost pure animal based
diet -- and the Innuit are also notable for having the highest rates
of osteoporosis in the world. Many Subsaharan African peoples have
very low dietary calcium intake compared to westerners, and yet have
very low rates of osteoporosis. In both cases, leaving one's
traditional culture and consuming a different diet leads to a
different rate of osteoporosis than among one's fellows living on the
traditional ancestral diet. It therefore does not appear that this
discrepancy is genetic in origin, but rather dietary.

Why is this? The current best theory is that this is because
metabolism of excess dietary protein requires calcium and ends up
consuming it in the process. When you eat too much protein, it doesn't
do your body any good -- the body does not store it beyond a certain
point, and simply metabolizes it, turning into stored glycogen or
fat. This metabolic process, as I mentioned, results in the use and
excretion of calcium. Very high protein intake means a very high loss
of calcium.

> The "all fat is bad" meme is incorrect, or at least misleading.

True enough, but as I said, you have no risk of consuming no fat in
your diet -- you could not manage it without living on some
synthetically constructed dietary program. Eating any normal vegan
diet will cause you to encounter more than enough fat to live on. For
the vast bulk of our country, the issue is consuming far too much fat
-- not the almost unheard of case of consuming too little.

Yeah, there is plenty of government propaganda in Cuba. Very little of

So, you are claiming that most Cuban exiles are being paid by the CIA?
All of the millions of them? [Peals of laughter].

Lets see. To support just one million Cubans, one needs only, lets be
conservative and say we'll only give each $10,000 a year in secret
checks. (Never mind how hard it would be to try to hide that a million
people were getting secret checks, and never mind that you need more
money than that to live well in the U.S.) That is about ten BILLION a
year -- a lot more than the entire CIA budget.

Get real.

Cuba is so badly off today that animals and in some cases people are
being used to plow the fields. (One article I read derisively noted
that the Cubans don't even have proper yokes for their oxen.) Half of
the young women in the country are out trying to prostitute themselves
to tourists to try to make enough money to survive. (That isn't a joke
-- I'm being literal.)  People living in a country where food
practically grows on trees have trouble getting enough to eat
well. One of the few things relieving the crushing poverty is the
constant inflow of dollars from tourists and overseas Cubans. Doctors
fight for the chance to become bellhops at tourist hotels, because it
pays so much better.

Maybe you can fool yourself, but its very hard to fool us.

I think the food combining, even though nonsense, could have beneficial
results.  If you follow it strictly, you automatically can't do a number of
bad things that people trying to eat less and eat healthy sometimes do - no
fried food in the morning, for example.  The need to follow the complicated
regimen of food combining also protects from over- or mis-eating in social sit
uations, which I find sometimes a real problem.  Fit for Life won't have
results any different than any other vegetarian diet (you eat what you want
of a large and varied set of choices), and the semi-religious food combining
nonsense might help people follow it better.  Certainly it's better than a
McDonald's diet.

The question is whether recent historical trends are a one-time
historical transition, or whether it is more a matter of cycles,
multiple equilibria, and other contextual effects.  Maybe both the very
prudish and the routinely nude cultures are self-consistent equilibria
in certain contexts.  But most of human history has been between these
extremes, and so absent a reason to expect some fundamentally new
development, I'd expect future culture to also lie within historical
ranges.

That's fine, people vary; but most people are more satisfied by 100 calories
of carbohydrate than 100 calories of fat.  Of course there are many other
variables affecting the feeling of satiety.

No; the studies show there is an advantage to having a low quantity of
*calories* in your diet (above starvation, of course).  High-fat, low-fat, no
big deal, as long as the calories are low.

Yes.  That's the benefit I was referring to.  But medium-calorie is better
than high-calorie, too; it's just that exercise can reduce or eliminate the
health risks of high-calorie (but not, apparently, those of medium-calorie).

We can also consider the motivations of someone who provides a free park.
I would guess that it would be done mostly for PR purposes.  Maybe there
would be small, tasteful signs at the main entrances, "This park provided
through the generosity of XYZ Corporation, dedicated to improving the
quality of public life."

Now, if XYZ is doing it to improve their image and make people feel good
about them, they won't want people to have a bad impression of the park.
If it is an "anything goes" area, with people copulating and shooting up
on the grass, this would make many visitors unhappy, in today's culture.
XYZ Corp is going to end up getting bad publicity instead of the benefits
they wanted.

So I would expect free areas which are subsidized like this to hew
pretty closely to average morality in what is allowed.  There would be
specialized places for people with particular interests, like nudists,
but that is no different from today's nudist camps and resorts.

I don't know whether nudism is becoming more popular.  In some ways we
see an increase in formerly "fringe" ideas due to the net, but at the
same time there seems to be a backlash from mainstream religious morality.
I'm very roughly guessing that the conservative religious forces will gain
strength through the year 2000, but then that the millenialist fervor
will die away (Christ's failure to return tarnishing the reputation of
extremists, and by extension all religions) and perhaps there will be a
swing back to liberal tolerance.  Your crystal ball is as good as mine,
though!

WHO CITES WORLDWIDE INCREASE IN HUMAN LONGEVITY
The United Nations World Health Organization reports that
average life expectancy is now 64 years in developing countries
and 80 years in some industrialized nations, with the overall
population of people older than 65 likely to grow by 82 per cent
in the next 25 years, compared with 46 per cent in the working
age population, and only 3 per cent in newborns. The WHO 1997
report also details the increased incidence in developing
countries of diseases usually associated with the industrialized
nations: heart disease, stroke, and cancer.
(Chicago Tribune 5 May)

RUSSIAN DEATH RATE RISING WHILE BIRTHS DECLINE
Recent studies indicate Russia is facing a demographic crisis
due to a rising death rate and falling birth rate. It appears
that Russian demographic indicators have dropped from those of a
developed country to those of so-called Third World countries.
Deaths in 1995 increased to 2.2 million from 1.4 million in
1989, while births in 1995 declined to 1.4 million from 2.2
million in 1989. A recent report of an advisory board to Boris
Yeltsin states that in 1995 Russia's death rate was higher than
in any European or North or South American country, and higher
than in most Asian and African states, while in 1989 death rates
were at the average European level. (Chicago Tribune 5 May)

COMPANY OBTAINS PATENT FOR SKIN CANCER MELANOMA GENE
Under present U.S. and European patent law it is possible to
obtain a patent on a human gene in the same manner as one
obtains a patent on a chemical compound. Myriad Genetics, the
Salt Lake City company that has two patents pending for breast
cancer genes (BRC-1 and BRCA-2), has now received a patent for
the gene it claims causes melanoma (Multiple Tumor Suppressor 1
or MTS1), and for the method of testing for the presence of that
gene in humans. Lisa Cannon-Albright, a University of Utah
geneticist, Mark Skolnik, a Myriad geneticist, and Alexander
Kamb, a Myriad molecular biologist are listed as the inventors.
(New York Times 5 May)

SYNTHESIS OF A NEW POLYMER THAT LOWERS BLOOD CHOLESTEROL
Ordinary cholesterol-lowering drugs either interfere directly
with cholesterol metabolism or introduce changes in the
sequestration of cholesterol in the blood. A Massachussetts
company, Geltex Pharmaceuticals Inc., has now patented a polymer
compound it claims can be taken orally to draw cholesterol out
of the bloodstream. The polymer, which is not absorbed into the
bloodstream, sequesters cholesterol in the gastrointestinal
tract, preventing exogenous or endogenous cholesterol from being
absorbed. In high-blood-cholesterol patients, the liver is thus
induced to use more available cholesterol to make bile acids
with a resultant lowering in blood cholesterol. The bile acids
are sent to the intestine, where their cholesterol is
sequestered by the polymer and prevented from returning to the
bloodstream. Three Geltex scientists, W. Harry Mandeville, S.
Randall Holmes-Farley, and John S. Petersen received the patent.
(New York Times 5 May)

CHEMIST CITES CRISIS IN DISTRIBUTION OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION
Alexandru T. Balaban, Professor of Organic Chemistry at the
University of Bucharest, argues that current methods of
distributing scientific information have caused critical
hardship to research workers in most countries of the world. In
Romania, for example, the only complete collection of *Chemical
Abstracts* exists in the capital city, Bucharest, although
universities and chemical research institutes are located in
five other cities. Balaban cites the paradox: Quality scientific
information is being produced, but only a tiny fraction of the
potential users can afford to buy and use this information. For
example, the Houben-Weyl *Methoden der organischen Chemie*,
important for any research in chemical synthesis, has more than
50 volumes with each volume priced at approxiamtely $2000.
Recent volumes are practically unavailable, and many libraries
have stopped subscribing to the well-known Gmelin and Beilstein
series as well. Balaban concludes that a completely new approach
to the dissemination of scientific information is badly needed,
perhaps an approach utilizing the current interconnections
available via the Internet. (American Scientist June 1997)

NATIONAL ACADEMY MEMBER REVISITS NAS REJECTION OF CARL SAGAN
Jared Diamond, a member of the U.S. National Academy of
Sciences, an elected honorary society and advisory group to the
U.S. Government, discusses the hostility of most scientists to
colleagues who popularize science, an apparent paradox, since
most scientists recognize the need to keep the public informed
about science. Diamond considers in detail the problem of the
rejection of recently deceased Carl Sagan by the Academy several
years ago. Although Sagan's research was considered important
enough so that he was nominated in the first place, his
nomination was challenged on the floor, and the two-thirds
majority required following such a challenge could not be
obtained. Diamond states his belief that Sagan was rejected
because of his efforts to popularize science, and that young
scientists have been therefore warned they risk ruining their
careers if they spend time communicating science to the general
public. (Discover May 1997)

NOVEL PATTERNS OF CANCER IN AIDS PATIENTS
It is perhaps to be expected that any disease or therapy that
interferes with the operation of the human immune system will
produce new spectra of associated diseases. At a recent
international meeting devoted to AIDS and cancer, held in
Bethesda MD, and sponsored by the U.S. National Cancer
Institute, studies were reported that show an increasing
incidence of various types of cancers in people infected with
the HIV virus that causes AIDS. The classic cancers associated
with AIDS are Kaposi's Sarcoma (skin and internal organs),
non-Hodgkins lymphoma (lymph system), squamous cell of the
conjunctiva of the eye, and in situ carcinomas of the cervix and
and anus. Now three other cancers are appearing in AIDS
patients: Hodgkin's disease (lymph system), plasmocytoma (blood
system), and leiomyosarcoma (muscle), and studies have also
suggested increases in the incidence of lung, lip, testicular,
and other cancers. One critical question is whether the
increased incidence of these HIV-associated cancers is due to
the effects of HIV on the immune system or to the affects of the
chemotherapeutic regimes on the immune system and/or other
systems. That question remains to be settled. Another puzzle is
that the new cancers associated with AIDS apparently differ in
different geographical regions, some cancers appearing in the
U.S. and Europe and not in Africa, and vice versa. The important
consideration is that studies of AIDS, cancer, and immunology
are fast coalescing into a unitary research entity.
(New York Times 6 May)

NEW CALCULATION OF HUBBLE CONSTANT APPEARS TO RESOLVE PARADOX
There has been a recent puzzle concerning the apparent age of
the universe and the apparent age of the oldest stars. Recent
data have suggested the universe is younger than the oldest
stars by a few billion years, which of course produces a
paradox. Now Simon Goodwin and John Gribbin at Sussex, working
with Martin Hendry in Glasgow, have devised and applied a new
method for estimating the age of the universe that apparently
resolves the paradox. The key to establishing the age of the
universe is the numerical value of the Hubble Constant (H). What
Goodwin, Gribbin, and Hendry have done is to deduce the value of
the Hubble Constant that must obtain if the average sizes of a
number of galaxies are to be statistically in harmony with the
average known sizes of other nearby galaxies whose distances are
now measurable with the Hubble Space Telescope. Once its distance is
known, the size of a galaxy can be measured by red shift analysis. The
new deduced result for the Hubble Constant puts the age of the
universe at 13 billion years, and since the latest data for the oldest
stars indicates their age at 12 billion years, the stellar
chronological paradox is apparently resolved. (Communicated by
jgribbin@biols.susx.ac.uk 7 May)  

VIRAL SABOTAGE CONFUSES THE HUMAN IMMUNE SYSTEM
Elucidation of the methods of combat in the ongoing war between
viruses and cells is one of the more fascinating areas of
biological research. Certain viruses have been shown to harpoon
cells with proteins to facilitate translocation of the virus
into the cell interior. Now there is evidence that once inside
the cell, viruses can take control of the protein synthetic
machinery responsible for putting out protein marker posts on
the cell surface that tell immune system cells whether the cell
has been invaded. By sabotaging the marker post production, the
invading virus controls the type of marker posts produced and
fools the immune system into believing the cell intact and
without pathogen visitors. The immune system does not destroy
such cells, and the virus is allowed to continue its
intracellular replication. (New York Times 6 May)

CLOCK GENES: LINK BETWEEN RESPONSES TO LIGHT AND CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS
Many organisms exhibit daily (circadian) rhythms, cyclical variations
in various bodily functions, metabolisms, etc., even in constant light
or constant darkness. Such biological clocks are most easily studied
in simple organisms. Now Susan K. Crosthwaite, et al, of the
Department of Biochemistry, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover NH, have
shown that certain clock genes in the fungus Neurospora are also
involved in the production of proteins necessary for the organism's
response to light, suggesting that circadian oscillators in more
complex organisms evolved from light-regulated pathways in simpler
organisms. (Science 2 May)

Are you all saying that there is definately no evidence that food combining
has any benefits, in and of, its own rights (the combining part, not the food
content)?  I have never studied it that much, but I have friends that try to
follow it.  Is there simply a lack of evidence supporting it, or is there
actually evidence contrary to it?  Just wondering.  Personally, I take plant
enzymes with my meals, and it aids digestion quite well.  In fact, even if
food combining did have any merits, I think enzymes would make food combing
obsolete.  I don't mean to get into a discussion, at this time, about
enzymes, I just thougt I'd mention it.  Thanks.

Actually, I doubt I can feel the difference from what you've done.  
I think your data is biased, even ignoring the small sample size.  Of
course, proper digestion of food always helps, I think you mean "proper"
food combining.  The problem is that you knew that you were supposed to
feel better following the more rigid diet.  This allows psychological
effects to alter the results.  
To get better results, the person being studied would have to be ignorant
of whatever supposed benefits food combining gives.  In addition, it would
be useful if the same foods were eaten but only the order was changed.  I
find it likely that you ate different foods (or at least different
quantities) in each diet.
Of course, if you think it works for you, go for it.  I would just
recommend that you be hesitant suggesting the diet to others.  Food combing
may seem too complex to someone who might normally accept a vegan diet for
health reasons.

Dear list,
     I had an interesting experience this week.  My little brother's
girlfriend had a daughter (my niece).  I /am/ now and "uncle".  My whole
family seemed to think this was /supposed to/ mean something to me.  I found
nothing particularly exciting about it.  After all, it isn't my child.  Nor
does /being/ an "uncle" change who I /am/.  My whole family (none of whom are
extropians) seemed to think I was uncaring or something.  I simply saw no
/big deal/ in the whole matter.  Would you classify me as "non-feeling" or
just "sensible"?  I think it's just an aspect of rational self interest,
myself.  I thank you for any comments you have.

For what its worth I find that you are being sensible.  It seems that the
only sort of response that is acceptable in this sort of situation is to
overflow with feelings of warmth at one's new found status.  I have found
it is too much trouble to meet people's expectations of how excited I
should look.  When I tried I spent a great deal of effort on my external
expressions and very little actually enjoying what was going on.  Of
course, its also rather foolish to go out of your way to show how not
impressed you are although I doubt you did this.  It is very annoying when
people ask for honest opinions, either directly or implied, and then get
annoyed when one doesn't give the opinion they want.

Well, there's nothing showing it's harmful, to my knowledge, and I'd be a bit
surprised if somebody did show it was harmful.  There have been a few animal
studies showing that combining foods (protein and carbohydrate) doesn't
affect digestion.  

My take on this (and some similar issues, like ketotic diets) is that if
people recommend major lifestyle changes without scientific backing, both
past and planned, they are *dangerous*.  People like that are slaves to their
memes, and uncontrolled memes can cause a lot of pain and suffering.  If you
know somebody is seriously irrational about their life's work, why should you
listen to *anything* they say?

The two aren't mutually exclusive.

On this particular subject (nieces) you are obviously unfeeling (I"m not
being pejorative, just literal).  Says nothing about whether you're unfeeling
about anything else.

Fondness for family is to a large extent programmed for genetic replication.
 Nothing senseless about ignoring it, or not having it.

(Of course, it might have been sensible to withold your opinions from
traditionalist family members :-)

Aren't you happy at least for the effect on your brother and parents?

I like Japan too, but it has its problems. Although far less than any 
communist country, government does indeed engage in a lot of intervention in 
Japan, and the level is far greater than the optimal amount (zero). The same 
thing is true of the USA, both would be much better off without any of it. 
I can only think of 3 areas where Japan has substantially more regulation 
than the USA.

1) Agriculture
2) Domestic Retailing
3) Telecommunications

I do not think it's a coincidence that those are also the 3 areas where
Japan is furthest behind.

If you have really been able to convince yourself that these silly reasons

permanently abandoned all their possessions and been eager to undergo an 
horribly dangerous and unpleasant voyage so they can live in capitalistic 
land full of strange customs where their language is not even spoken,  then I 
can only conclude that your critical thinking skills, at least in economics 
and politics, have been destroyed by a malignant socialist meme.

I am neither happy nor sad.  I have too many things in my own life to be
concerned with, to be concerned, or even care, about my brother's situation.
 If I'm not personally involved in any situation, it's really of no concern
to me.  I only have so much attention to go around, and currently, it's
pretty much all on me and my projects.  Besides, my family (every member of
it, practically) are about as different from me as I could imagine.  To me,
mental similarity is more important than genetic similarity.

Ain't that the truth.  I think it's okay to eat meat every day, as long as
it's a secondary part of the diet.  I find vegetables a more interesting and
easy to prepare food normally anyway, so for me it's no strain to keep meat
consumption down.  But it certainly makes life easier to say "no, I don't eat
that, period"

Sometimes when I eat out I find that the lean meat dishes may actually be the
best food choice available.  I think a chicken breast is a better choice than
creamed spinach or french fries.

I'm the originator of this line, and I'd like to say, one major reason I
think the world will go nude is due to the fact that almost all the current
reasons people wear clothing is due to religious beliefs, or just plain being
accustomed to it.  Once the "average" person has eliminated mysticisms, as
would be expected in a highly advanced society of the future, the very reason
people wear clothes will be gone.  The "averageo" person will also be more
inclined not to do forceful things, like rape, or else they would have been
"taken care of" at some point in time be private athorities.  As for the need
to prevent "overexposure" to the sun, or to the extreme cold, clothing will
still be optional.  I just think that one comes to a mental point of
realizing that at times, there is no need for clothes, and thus, a "rational"
person would choose to save his/her/its resources, not wear something
unneccessarily, and have no hangups about his physical body, which at some
point in time will itself be considered "clothing" to the mind (after
uploading, or at least once we have sufficient data transfer techniques to
change bodies).  Any comments?

Sounds unlikely; as far as I know all mammals have body fat, especially
animals in colder climates - how would they survive the winter shortage of
food without it? My guess is that wild rabbits have *little* fat compared 
to tame animals who are fed ad libitum instead of having to find edible 
stuff by themselves.

Hmm, what are those enzymes, and how do they aid digestion? Just curious,
I have this feeling plant's doesn't contain many enzymes that breaks down
plant materials better than our digestive enzymes (after all, evolution
favors animals that can digest plants, but not plants that can digest
plants).

It would be interesting to explore the alternatives to clothing. Fur 
immediately comes to mind, as does skin pockets to carry around things. 
But these are relatively drastic changes, are there less dramatic changes 
that can be used to protect against the elements and maybe express ourselves?

Our culture values family cohesion (often so much that some families break
down due to the pressure to be happy), and if there is any area where
people are conservative, it is family roles. My own associations to the
word 'uncle' suggests a friendly older mentor to the child, and I think
this is quite close to what most people associate with avuncularity.  So
when you become uncle, many people expect you to conform to this role;  by
not doing so you upset their basic assumptions about family, which in
turn causes a reaction. 

I really don't know how one *ought* to behave in this kind of situation. 
There is nothing wrong with not feeling (I know that this view is rare in
our currently emotion-promoting society), just as there is no reason to
avoid feeling anything; it is a personal decision what/if to feel. Of
course, it might be an useful strategy to play along to put others at
ease, but this is also an individual decision. 

Personally I hope my brother has a child, I really look forward to play
uncle and give the child extropian ideas from the start... ;-)

I really look forward to the time when we have the freedom of pretty
unconstrained self engineering (however faint the chances of me/us
actually managing the temporal leap to that Eden (that's not dynamic
optimism speaking)). Converting oneself first in a free-space capable
distributed life form, subsequent evolution towards astroengineering life,
then, mayhap, even timespace engineering? 

Speaking of self engineering, why does the majority find this aspect
particularly abhorrent? Why that urge to remain locked in place/stagnate
forever, while the only constant in the univeres is constant change?

I tried a food-combining diet by a Frenchman called Michel Montignac,
which is quite well known in Europe.  Subjectively I felt great and
slimmed down quite a lot - although that might be mainly because he
recommended cutting out anything with sugar altogether.  His idea is to
cut out stuff like potatoes and rice and refined flour breads altogether
; occasionally eat wholemeal bread on its own with almost nothing else;
for main meals eat vegetables + a bit of meat; and lots of fruit, but
separately from anything else.  The diet was very much a gourmet sort of
diet (it allowed oddities like nibbling cheese whenever you like, and a
bit of red wine and pure chocolate every now and then - very French!).

I drifted out of it because it was just too difficult to sustain around
the kind of work I was doing (temping), where sandwiches and junk food are
the norm.

It seems to me that the main plausibility about food combining is that
our ancestors wouldn't have been likely to have had combinations of food
at all - they would probably have gorged themselves on one kind of food
at a time, as they found it.  Right or wrong?

I asked this question myself when people started objecting to human
clones. I think a fear of the unknown could be the major cause of
arguments which suggest that such technologies are 'unethical'.

I see no ethical problems with self-engineering or cloning...
unless we actually are made in the image of God, blah, blah, yadda,

Powder mixed with water or juice is very well absorbed. Loose packed
capsules are also well absorbed, and are obviously more portable. You can
get the buffered vit C in both of these. Neither, of course, are going to do
much for oral cravings. Ester C is the name brand, and there are generics as
well. This form of vit C (calcium polyascorbate) is also claimed to be
bettter absorbed and retained in the body than regular vit C (ascorbic acid).

I have bought most of my supplements for the past 2 years through The
Vitamin Shoppe. Very good prices and prompt service. I don't have their
phone number handy, but you can order a catalog through their website at
www.vitaminshoppe.com

Well, there you have it.  I think most Extropians would agree with the second
statement, although many share mental similarities with their families (I
do).  Naturally your family isn't going to approve of this attitude.

I think it's valuable for happiness to have people you are very close to,
have been close to for a long time, and will be close to for a long time.
 Family is an easy and common way to get this, but it's not the only one.

Any comments?

	Gee Robin, we know about 300 mystics and not one of them has ever
expressed a word against nudity....lots of words against organized
religions and governments, but nothing against nudity.  They are really a
bunch of "live-and-let-live" people.  Of course, we are only speaking from
experience.  What are you speaking from?

	Our own experience with nudity, having a nude home, grounds and pool for
our guests, is that as people get used to it, it becomes acceptable as
"natural" and the connection with sex disappears.  In Europe, nudity is
quite acceptable at the beaches, in ads on televison, etc.  Since most of
the members of this list are living in that bastion of Puritan values, the
Home of the Land, Free of the Brave, they are also plauged with the meme of
"Nudity is bad, Nudity means sex."  In another 50 years, we expect that
even this meme will die a "natural death".  Meanwhile, check out what
attitudes you have about nudity and where did it come from?   Perhaps, with
a little self-examination, you too will be free of this particular hang-up.

> I think the food combining, even though nonsense, could have beneficial
> results.  

	After more than 20 years as a vegetarian, we know something about "food
combining".  We have not read the "Fit For Life" book, but the information
we have has to do with the Essential Amino Acids (EAA).  The eight EAA are
those which we cannot synthesize.  Our protein pattern requires that we
consume these EAAs in relationship to each other at the same meal.  If a
food is low in one of these EAAs, the usable protein is less.  It is a bit
like building a stick man with Tinker-Toys.  If it takes, four red sticks,
four blue sticks, and three round pieces to make a stick man and you have
four hundred red sticks, four hundred blue sticks and thirty round pieces,
you can make ten stick men.  The rest of the red sticks and blue sticks are
useless for building stick men.  The limiting amino acid determines how
much protein in a food is useable.  The idea behind combining foods is that
you take one with lots of red sticks and round pieces but few blue sticks
and combine it with one that has losts of blue sticks and few red sticks or
round pieces and eat them at the same meal.  Cultures all over the world do
this already.  Rice and beans are just one example of combining two foods
which, by themselves are low in useable protein, but by combining them one
obtains much more useable protein.
  For the skeptics..."Amino Acid Content of Foods and Biological Data on
Proteins, Food and Agricultural Organization of the U.N., Rome, 1970"

Certainly it's better than a

That sound like an good diet, as long as you don't pig out on the cheese.
 I'd probably be in trouble.  This kind of diet would make many people lose
weight and feel good; no need for food combining to explain anything.

Really, there's no good way to know.  Food in the wild tends not to come in
enormous quantity, although there are exceptions.

The black budget, for all the attempts made to hide it, is an open
secret. The New York Times publishes its approximate size every year
around budget time, as do many other news sources. This is hardly
shocking impossible-to-get information -- which shouldn't surprise
anyone, given how hard it is to hide anything that literally thousands
of people know.

While I would very much like to participate on this thread, I have a 
request/suggestion prior to doing so:  Could we drop the notion of 
ranking our research questions as more or less important?  I have 
seen far too many debates on both transhumanist lists over whose work 
will impact evolution more, and it tends to devolve into personal 
arguments.

We each possess our own visions of the directions in which humanity 
will evolve, and I personally think that everyone's work is vitally 
important in the expansion of our abilities and endeavors.  I also 
project that, because choice has entered as a determining factor, humans 
will actually multi-track onto different paths of expansion and 
transformation, maybe even to the point of developing into different 
sets of species altogether.

Sin,

I heard that animals and young humans will naturally choose a good diet. I
think it was Douglas Rushkoff who told me about a study in which a
young child was given unlimited candy, chocolate, sugar based foods,
vegetables, fruit etc. etc.

Naturally the kid choose the candy, the biscuits, the junk and sugary
foods - immediate gratification. But apparently the baby got tired of
eating too much crap and then spent a whole day gorgeing on broccoli and
cabbage and less immediatly satisfying food. Accordingly he got a balanced
diet naturally.

I do not know which study which he was refering too, does anyone have any
idea? Or is it an urban myth?

I'm not a nutrition expert, but this sounds highly unlikely (and just the
kind of "common sense" explanation that seems to be so common in
non-scientific dieting). The epithelium in the guts doesn't absorb
nutrients in special ratios, it just absorbs available nutrients and let's
the liver deal with them. If you eat too little of one EAA you will still
get enough of the other amino acids. 

It should be noted that it is fairly rare to have deficiencies in the diet
of EAAs, since they are quite common in general. According to a chemistry
text I found somewhere, it makes evolutionary sense not to vaste
metabolism making amino acids that you can easily get from your food. So
my guess is that combining foods is just a simple strategy to be sure you
have all nutrients you need by ingesting a bigger mixture, nothing more,
nothing less. It should be noted that animalic food contains all EAA, it
is just vegans who need to worry (?) about them and eat a somewhat more
diverse diet.

Um......okay.

I don't want to seem completely paranoid, but..... 

How can the Times know EXACTLY how much the budget is. Fair enough, you
said it was an estimate but their figures may still only scratch the
surface - there may actually be an Illuminati, a Hagbard Celine, etc. etc.

The Times could take a look at my garbage/bank account and tell the
world exactly what I consumed last year, but it would hardly be accurate
considering how much I recycle/spend and how much I don't throw 
away/channel into other areas.


I am not a conspiracy freak but neither do I believe that we can fully
know the budget of certain government agencies.

No, it isn't, but many people attempt (irrationally) to keep their
children away from nude people for whatever reason. ("Quiet Enjoyment"
is a legal term of art -- it doesn't imply sound.)

For what its worth, though, there is no rule in the cooperative
apartment complex I live in against being nude in any of the common
areas. I don't think the question has ever come up, frankly. If it
did, this being New York, the likely answer would be fairly liberal.

Note that historical ranges include primitive cultures which are, for
our purposes, nudists, although they wouldn't think of themselves as
such.

I'm also not very sure about the "cycles" notion. European and North
American body modesty mores have pretty much remained on the "prudish"
side of the line from the fall of Rome until the last century. Thats a
very long cycle indeed! I suspect that the primacy of Christianity had
more to do with it than "natural cycles".

Hal Finney writes:

Actually, in my "park" examples I was *not* assuming a free park --
merely one which is open to the public, just as all McDonalds
restaurants are open to members of the general public. That doesn't
mean that they are free -- just that one needn't make special
arrangements to use them.

[As an aside, in case libertopia were to hit next week, it is my expectation
that a not-for-profit organization like the Central Park Conservancy
would control and maintain New York's Central Park (in my opinion, an
excellent example of an urban park), rather than a private
corporation. My suspicion is that a wide variety of ownership models
would show up for parks and similar spaces -- for profit, membership
based, non-profit with usage fees, non-profit without usage fees, "PR"
based free parks paid for by companies, etc.]

I disagree, for a number of reasons.

1) You dismiss too casually the need for clothing as a protection
   against the elements. The need is very real, as someone living in a
   city where the temperatures in winter get far below the freezing
   point of water for months on end can attest.
2) You also ignore the need for clothing as a way of protecting
   against things like filthy work environments or subways or other
   places where one probably doesn't want bare skin contacting all
   manner of things.
3) Clothing also serves many other functions. As someone who was
   quasi-married to a fashion designer for many years, I can
   personally attest that much of the work that goes into clothing has
   nothing to do with purely utilitarian concerns but rather is
   concerned with artistry, display (both of taste and of wealth),
   social signals (what one wears is one of one's most important
   social signaling mechanisms, btw), and a variety of similar
   concerns that have nothing to do with concerns like 1 and 2. This
   should not be surprising -- were it not the case, all people would
   wear something like hyperfunctional jumpsuits or overalls at all
   times.

Note that your model of a purely rational person has no "good reason"
to want a persian carpet, or a fine painting on their wall -- and yet
many people do want these sorts of things. Not all rational desires
may be explained in purely functional terms.

The CIA budget as a whole is public knowledge, it is the line items that

The RC roach experiment involves tearing out the roach's antennae, and
implanting electrodes at the root where the nerves are. They then use
electrical impulses to each antenna to simulate the sensation of the
antenna hitting a solid object. Sensing this, the roach's natural
response is to turn away, so this allows scientists to steer the roach.

True, its not western media that makes the cuban government put most
arable farmland into sugarcane production for export, neglecting the
production of nutritious food supplies for its own citizens, thus
causing widespread malnutirtion that is manifesting itself in blindness
and other related health problems.

Right.  And thats the whole deal about food combining: one food group at a

grains, with at least an hour inbetween.  The diet uses less energy to digest
food, thus giving u more energy out of your food.

I do not only see TV and radio as media, but also people. Trained
demagogues who are supposed to infiltrate Cuba. Such operations have
always taken place, not only in Cuba, but in other countries, too. When
you see big demonstrations in the Tv, like in Bosnia, Bulgaria etc.,
this can only be the effect of media propaganda. The fact that such
demonstrations haven't taken place in Cuba shows that the US influence
is not strong enough to do this. Castro isn't a bum, he will keep this
influence as low as possible, not because he wants to keep his power but
because he knows that many people would suffer otherwise.

The US have always done everything possible to get rid of communist
countries. This little Cuba is, besides North Korea, one of
the last socialist regimes which doesn't privatize itself too much. The
effects on the people living there are bad, and maybe free markets would
make the standard of living better for many of them (making Cuba what it
was under Batista, the brothel and casino of the US) -- but if Cuba was
a free market country and isolated the way it is now, you can be sure
that it would be much worse there than in North Korea.

One can be sure: For a country under these conditions, Cuba is doing as
good as possible. If I would live there, I might try to get to the US,
too -- in the hope that things are better there. But it isn't very
likely that they'd be for me, with about 20 % poor children.

Compared to other Latin Americans. About 19.7 % of Cuban children in the
US are poor (Puerto Rican: 40.4 %).

Cuba doesn't supress any abilities, it just prevents people from
becoming richer than necessary.

When you claim that they spread propaganda, you must prove it. It has
been proven for US media millions of times (see media during Vietnam &
Gulf War, presidential elections etc.). And the media in the US aren't
owned by gov't. Why do they support it? Because all big enterprises want
a *strong* gov't helping them to stay big and to collect money. They
could do without it, too -- and many of the big ones therefore try to
privatize the state.

Nonsense. With the US, a main trade partner is gone. Economic
impoverishment is a direct consequence of this.

I am no communist. I wouldn't want to live in Cuba, North Korea or even
China. I already said that my "dream-economy" is that of Japan,
partially because of state intervention, partially because of a kind of
"politics of consent". Big enterprise leaders there have realized that
operating the way US leaders do would lead their country back to the
Middle Age.

I read about this in Newsweek.  I can't remember any specific study but I
think that the article was leaning more towards the idea that young kids
know how many calories they need.

Perhaps its an ingrained thing having to do with either the fear of
strangeness, fear of sickness, or both. Anyone who does not look like
someone in my tribe, or look like a healthy example of a member of my
tribe is a threat due to either hostility or disease.

The "food combining" advocated in FFL is not the accurate and supported
"protein combining" you're referring to.  It's the claim that mixing foods,
other than certain very specific mixtures, makes the food indigestible and
thereby causes serious health problems.

As I've pointed out, there is no scientific evidence for this assertion, and
the assertors display a distressing lack of basic biology knowledge.  If this
were actually true, since Westerners already get more energy than they need
from their food (that's why so many are fat), proper food combiners would
tend to be even fatter.  "Not enough energy from food" is simply not a
problem even for the strictest vegan.

The only grain of truth here is that digestion, particularly of fiber and
starch, does take a lot of water, and eating this way means you'll have
gotten a lot of water before your starches.  But there's no need to get the
water for digesting the beans by eating fruit 2 hours in advance - drinking a
glass with the meal wil work just as well.

The following is from 'Love Your Body', Viktoras Kulvinkas, M.S.:

"Most people suffer digestive disorders...the biggest villian is serving
two concentrated foods that are hard to digest at the same meal. Man's
digestive tract was not made to be a receptacle for an 8 course meal
containing a wide array of poisons...The typical combination of meat,
potatoes (sic), butter or margarine, a glass of milk along with an array
of highly processed carbohydrates (bread, pastries), has produced the
sickest nation on this planet.

"Protein requires acid digestive juices, while starch and sweet food
requirte alkaline. You cannot digest both at the same time. Dairy products
are highly alkaline, so they interfere with meat digestion. Fat interferes
with protein digestion.

"Poorly combined food remains too many hours in the digestive tract. In
this warm environment it rots and/or ferments, producing a wide range of
poisons, headache, and an unloving disposition.

"Vegetables take longer to digest than fruit; combining them in a single
meal can cause fermentation."


The guy is a bit of a hippie and he needs a better proofreader but what he
is saying seems to make sense. He gives a chart of good/bad combinations:

Good:

Protein and leafy greens
Starch and veg.
Oil and leafy greens.
Oil and acid fruit.
Oil and subacid fruit (non-citrus I guess)

Poor:

Protein and acid fruit
Leafy greens and acid fruit
Leafy Greens and subacid fruit

Bad:

Protein and starch
Oil and protein
Starch and fruit


Thought this above may be interesting to list members.

This is the only book on nutrition that I possess, can anyone recomend any
other/better sources?

This is, as others have pointed out, completely wrong. The digestive 
juices in the stomach are acidic, and the juices in the intestine alkaline. 
Even if some foods tend to push the balance in some directions, the 
gastrointestinal system has some pretty clever regulatory systems that 
notices if the pH is wrong and fix it (it should be noted that the 
intestine has a quite complex nervous system of its own, with very loose 
connections to the nervous system "proper").

An amusing paragraph, and rather typical for what one will hear from many 
alternative health groups. Rot does not normally occur in the stomach, 
and if it did we would have much bigger problems than an unloving 
disposition (toxic megalocolon comes to mind). As for poisons and 
headaches, is this the reason bulls are so angry? After all, there is 
plenty of fermentation going on in bovine stomaches. 

Thanks for posting this text. While I disagree with it, it is good to go 
back to the sources and look at what they say.

I agree about the need for clothing in certain wheather conditions, and if
someone wishes to wear them as a form of "art", then that's fine too.  I
think there may be many people who are more function oriented, who will
prefer not to wear clothes during the times when there is no apparent reason
to.  Concerning the "art" issue, in many tribal cultures, it is "normal" and
"artistic" to wear either rings around the neck (stretching the neck in the
process), or to cut slits in the lower lip, and inserting a "plate" into it,
gradually stretching the skin more, and inserting a larger "plate".  I think
wearing clothing for "art" could be looked at in a way, as we would look at
these tribal people's "art".  I must admit, I am very funtional oriented.  I
like art too, but I pay cash for that which is useful in some way.  The more
useful, the more valuable.  Things of no real use, but are "rare" and demand
large amounts of money, I believe is an artificial augmentation of value.  An
old rare coin, a Renoir painting, and an ancient book could all be reproduced
for a small fraction of the price of the original, and with molecular
duplication techniques that will come about "soon", I would not recommend
investing in these kinds of things now.  Like in the duplication chamber
idea, "If there is no difference between two things, they are essentially the
same thing."  Any comments?

I have always enjoyed your comments, Michael.  This one seems to ring true.
 If a "moron" can't produce anything for society, they have much more time to
"reproduce".  I once heard a saying that went something like "When a man
can't produce, he'll reproduce".  I'm glad we'll be able to prevent the
devolution of the species, since we are going to develop scientific methods
to augment all people.  As a non-moron myself, I can also attest to the
difficulty of finding other non-morons to mate with.  Us thinking people have
a more difficult time meeting other thinking people, since the morons are the
majority.  :-)  Shawn M. Johnson

Here is that acid/base nonsense again.  I've already posted how this is flat
wrong and betrays a basic lack of understanding of biology.

>"Vegetables take longer to digest than fruit; combining them in a single
>meal can cause fermentation."

Oh, here's another one.  No matter what you do, unless you're on serious
antibiotics or lots of Beano, if you eat fiber, when it hits your colon, it
*will* ferment.  

Technically, this statement is correct. Vegetables have fiber, so combining
them with fruit will cause fermentation.  What he doesn't say is that *not*
combining them causes fermentation too!  Wonder if Kulvinkas knows that.

Ooh, throw that one away.

Walford's books are good, although geared to calorie restriction.  Pritikin
is reasonable as well, if stringent.  Most of the "heart-healthy" (AMA style)
diet books are OK.  Laurel's Kitchen Cookbook is a pleasant read and has good
(vegetarian) recipes and common sense.

>addition, are there any other natural languages without a form of to be?

Many Asian languages do not accomodate the concept of an individual, 
personal 'be'.  

While I agree that English speakers grossly overruse the verbal 
constructions of 'be', I don't support trashing it altogether.  The 
flexibility and scope of the English language creates an enormous 
toolbox for writing.  E-Prime's value to me lies in its emphasis on 
utilizing the more neglected constructions.

I think that given a homogenous society, the verb "to be" actually is
very useful. If we share many of the same things in our lives, it is
very easy for one to infer the context of the use of the verb, thus
saving time in communication. Of course, as a society becomes diverse
and widespread, loss of context is a natural communications dysfunction,
which could explain such things as the generation gap, why guys don't
"get it", and why white guys don't rap.

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

Genetic Programming 1997 Conference (GP-97)
July 13 - 16 (Sunday - Wednesday), 1997
Fairchild Auditorium - Stanford  University - Stanford, California
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
In cooperation with American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), 
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), SIGART, and Society for Industrial 
and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
WWW FOR GP-97: http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~koza/gp97.html
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: You are urged to make your housing arrangements as early as possible
since convenient hotel locations are limited.  Also, if you are driving
to the Stanford campus, please be aware of parking lot construction in
the area of Fairchild Auditorium and allow a little extra time 
(particularly on the first Monday session) to find a parking place.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Genetic programming is an automatic programming technique for evolving 
computer programs that solve (or approximately solve) problems.  Starting with 
a primordial ooze of thousands of randomly created computer programs, a 
population of programs is progressively evolved over many generations using 
the Darwinian principle of survival of the fittest, a sexual recombination 
operation, and occasional mutation.   
 
The first annual genetic programming conference in 1996 featured 15 tutorials, 
2 invited speakers, 3 parallel tracks, 73 papers, and 17 poster papers in 
proceedings book, and 27 late-breaking papers in a separate book distributed 
to conference attendees, and 288 attendees.  A description of GP-96 appears in 
the October 1996 issue of Scientific American 
(http://www.sciam.com/WEB/1096issue/1096techbus3.html).  This second annual 
conference in 1997 reflects the rapid growth of this field in which over 600 
technical papers have been published since 1992.  For August 5, 1996 article 
in E. E. Times on GP-96 conference and August 12, 1996 article in E. E Times 
on John Holland's invited speech at GP-96, go to
http://www.techweb.com/search/search.html

There will be 36 long, 33 short, and 15 poster papers at the Second Annual
Genetic Programming Conference to be held on July 
13-16 (Sunday - Wednesday), 1997 at Stanford University.
In addition, there will be late-breaking papers (published in a separate
book in mid June after the June 11 deadline for late-breaking papers).
Topics include, but are not limited to,
applications of genetic programming, theoretical foundations of 
genetic programming, implementation issues, technique extensions, cellular 
encoding, evolvable hardware, evolvable machine language programs, automated 
evolution of program architecture, evolution and use of mental models, 
automatic programming of multi-agent strategies, distributed artificial 
intelligence, auto-parallelization of algorithms, automated circuit synthesis, 
automatic programming of cellular automata, induction, system identification, 
control, automated design, data and image compression, image analysis, pattern 
recognition, molecular biology applications, grammar induction, and 
parallelization.  Papers describing recent developments are also solicited in 
the following additional areas: genetic algorithms, classifier systems, 
evolutionary programming and evolution strategies, artificial life and

Thats just common sense.  It goes with the water content of food, the higher
the water content, the easier to digest.  Water and fruit at the top of the
list, and grains and meat at the bottom.

That is totally false, the assimilation of food groups by themselves makes
more energy because less energy is used to digest it because certain
chemicals work better when not combined with other chemicals, thats basic
chemistry.  And proper food combining loses fat more so than not.

With Montignac's method, his point re slimming was that if you combine
foods wrongly the energy is stored as fat instead of used up immediately

It's rather interesting that this seems to have been the case for a very
long time.  In chimpanzees, the political leader has less children than
average.  This was discovered using DNA testing of hair fibers as well as
feces. I would find it interesting if someone checked on the reproductive
success of the leader's siblings.
Looking at humans, Western Europeans kept a large number of their most
intelligent people out of the gene pool through the priesthood.  In China
those who disagreed with the official views of the historical texts were
cut out of the gene pool either through death or quite literally.  The
human race has been "devolving" for quite some time now but somehow we
manage to pull through.

Since no one else has said it:

It is true that in Hebrew, the verb "to be" is dropped in lots of
circumstances. You say the equivalent of "I Perry" (or should that be
"Me Tarzan"), not "I am Perry". However, this is of no more
significance than the practice in English of dropping the second
person pronoun in imperitives ("Go to the store!") -- the verb is
implied, just as the second person pronoun is implied. The listeners
"hears it" even if it isn't there, as it were.

I don't know of any examples of a language that truly lacks "to be",
though I'm not a linguist.

I'd be curious what his theory is.  The liver does decide whether to store
food energy as glycogen (which tends to get used) or fat (which tends to hang
around).  A big enough meal will overwhelm the liver's ability to store
glycogen and the rest goes straight to fat.  There's also a theory, with
conflicting studies, that evening calories are more prone to end up as fat
than morning calories.

Certain chemicals, yes.  All chemicals, no.  The chemicals in digestion, no.

*If* proper food combining worked as stated, the body would have more energy,
which means that unless the combiners significantly upped their exercise,
their livers would convert it into fat.  But in fact it doesn't, and food
combiners usually lose weight because they eat a lower-calorie diet.

Well, you know, trained demagogues are out in force all over the world
defending Cuba -- take you, for example. And yet, we don't see people
fleeing the west for the socialist paradise.

You know, its amazing how close that assessment is to the one that
Richard Nixon gave for anti-Vietnam war protests. "Outside
Agitators". No one on their own could *possibly* dislike someone like
Slobodan Milosovich -- after all, he's the friend of the workers,
right?

I bet the wall fell in East Germany because of those darn trained
"outside agitators" too, just like with the student protests in the
'60s in the U.S.

Yeah. Right now, its so much better with it being the brothel and

Dunno. South Africa managed to do pretty well even when it was under
sanctions. Of course, Cuba isn't *really* isolated -- the government
is free to buy anything it likes from Canada, Europe, and South
America. Sanctions there are astoundingly porous -- Americans can even
go there pretty freely if you travel through Mexico or Canada.

Walter Cronkite's painful declaration on the evening news that the war

the proletariat, eh?

Maybe they have this weird idea that its better to be in a free

I see you know at least as much about Japan as you do about most other

Strange that the U.S. isn't back in the middle ages. I guess we just

I've been following some of the food combining thread. I got into the Fit
For Life books a while back and tried their suggestions for at least a year
and a half.  My cholesterol ratio was bad, so I was looking to exercise more
and change my diet in order to bring it down. I tried to follow the food
combing program... Fruit in the morning, bagels for lunch, salad and low fat
protein for dinner. I didn't lose any fat and my cholesterol didn't improve
even though I rode my bike and climbed some. Then almost exactly a year ago
I heard one of the authors of "Protein Power" on the radio, and went and
bought that book, and later "The Zone" by Barry Sears, PH.D.  ["Protein
Power" by Michael R. Eades, M.D. and Mary Dan Eades, M.D.  "Why too many
carbohydrates in your diet stimulate your insulin production, which actually
makes your body store fat."] 

I caution that neither book cites much in the way of controlled scientific
studies of their diet.  

These books look at something that the Fit For Life program seems to
ignore...the insulin-stimulating effects of a high carbohydrate diet and the
problems that brings.
Insulin activates the enzymes that run the cholesterol-making apparatus,
resulting in overproduction of cholesterol. 

"Our own cells make cholesterol and lots of it. In fact, 70 to 80% of the
cholesterol burbling along in your blood vessels was made by your own body.
Only 20 to 30% came from your diet. Every cell in the body has the capacity
to make cholesterol, but most is made in the liver, the intestines, and the
skin, with the vast majority coming from the liver cells. Elevated levels of
insulin spur these cells to churn out vast amounts of cholesterol, leading
to elevated blood levels." (Protein Power, pg 33-34)

Our body needs cholesterol, and when the c. level in each cell goes down, it
can produce it internally or it can increase the LDL receptors on the
surface of the cell and take cholesterol out of the blood, or a combination
of both. If you interfere with the internal production of cholesterol (as
the cholesterol drug lovastatin does), LDL receptors rush to the surface of
the cell to pluck the LDL cholesterol our of the bloodstream, bringing about
a quick and significant lowering of LDL cholesterol in the blood. But
lovastatin has caused liver problems, muscular disorders, etc. Protein Power
claims that you can get the cholesterol-lowering results w/o having to
resort to drug therapy. 

There is one step in the cholesterol synthesis pathway inside the cell
called the rate-limiting step [3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A
(HMG-CoA)reductase] that determines how fast and how much cholesterol gets
produced. Insulin stimulates HMG-CoA reductase, while glucagon inhibits it.
A diet high in carbs calls forth insulin, but a diet with lower carbs puts
you in a glucagon mode.

Since my wife is an insulin dependent diabetic, I had already known that
when she has to take insulin to cover for her impending meal, carbs raise
her blood sugar more quickly. Some new, radical approaches to controlling
diabetes stress cutting carb consumption dramatically, so you take much less
insulin. I had tracked down an out-of-print book by a doctor with a clinic
on Long Island who has had success with this program, so I thought I might
try decreasing my carb consumption also. "Protein Power" predicted that a
very low carb diet would quickly and dramatically lower triglycerides. Then
HDL would gradually rise, and LDL would lower.

I went on a very low carb diet, and my triglycerides dropped 200 points in 2
weeks. My HDL did rise, very slightly, and my LDL dropped about 30, my total
c went down by about 35. I also lost about 4 inches off my waist over the
course of several months. Unfortunately, the medical plan I have won't let
me order the blood tests I would like, and I have to see the doctor before
getting tests done. So this data is very limited. I wouldn't do this
yourself without considering everything carefully. 

Where this dovetails slightly with food combining is that in the early, very
low carb phase that Protein Power recommends if you have bad cholesterol
ratios, high blood pressure, or are more than 20% overweight; you shoot for
30 grams of carbs a day. This means you don't combine much because you
hardly eat ANY starch. Later you raise your carb level to 40% of the
calories at any meal, with 30% protein and 30% fat [The Zone]. You figure
how much protein to eat by figuring your lean body mass and by multiplying
that figure by .5 grams of protein daily (if you are sedentary, .6 if you do
some exercise, etc.) and dividing that up into 3 meals.

Protein Power claims that game hunting was the primary means of sustenance
for our ancestors 700,000 years ago. From that time until the beginnings of
agriculture about 8,000 to 10,000 years ago) 60 to 90% of the calories in
mans diet was from large and small game animals, birds, eggs, reptiles and
insects. 

"The forces of natural selection acting over some 7,000 centuries shaped and
molded our physiology to function optimally on a diet consisting
predominantly of meat supplemented with roots, shoots, berries, seeds and
nuts. Only within the last 100 centuries have we reversed the order to
become mainly carbohydrate eaters with meat as the supplement. This dietary
reversal-from a diet providing, on average, about 75% of its calories from
some sort of meat with the remainder coming from plants to one in which only
25% of calories comes from meat, the rest from other sources, has taken
place in approximately 400 to 500 generations, far short of the 1,000 to
10,000 generations deemed necessary by geneticists to allow any substantial
generic changes to take place. We may yet adapt to the high carbohydrate
agriculture diet, but history tells us it will probably take another 10,000
years."(Protein Power pg 17).

I've found a book called "The Paleolithic Diet" and am checking this out.

In the meantime, I think Fit For Life or Food Combining pushes carbs too
much. Your mileage may vary.

Sorry I can't be of more help, I don't have the book any more - although
I had been thinking recently of trying the diet again, and these posts
have reminded me of that, so I might get one of his books again.  He's
written two or three, mostly the same info with variations and different
recipes and updated versions. One is called "Eat Yourself Slim", as I
recall.  I'll try and look it up, if you like.

There are similar grammatical structures in Hungarian when using the verb
"to be", though the two languages have little else in common.

Last night I found myself in a futile conversation.  I couldn't tell at
first if this woman was on a mystic-trip or actually in touch with
reality, but I new it was over when she said, "Have you read _The
Celestine Prophesy_?"  I'm sure many of you have been there...

The woman I conversed with exhibited a pattern of thought that I've noticed in
numerous conversations with New Agers:  They can rebuke any attempt at
rational thought b/c their belief system allows them to say anything,
making up mind-fodder as they go along.  Now, many of you who are far more
leathal at intellectual sparring than I are surely more successful at arguing
with mystics than I.  My arguing skills are need of developement (hence
this post).  As I struggle to put together rational replies to their
fanciful ramblings, these mystics run circles around my logic.  How do
experienced rational thinkers deal with people who can say anything (that
is to the extent that they can be dealt with)?

Also, these people think they are quantum mechanics, rigging their
silliness with quatum "stuff."  These people don't even have a clue about the
concept of a quantized energy packet, yet they think that watching _Quantum
Leap_ or reading books by quacks who give no references gives them
understanding enough to invoke quantum physics as "proof" of their
madness.  I know just enough about quantum mechanics to know not to f***
with it, yet they don't notice that the people who do know what they're
talking about spend years, if not decades, understanding quantum mechanics
to the extent that is understood.  These fruit-loops are a sad lot.  

Enough angst.

Warning: this was the old method of treating diabetes, and was abandoned
(about 40 years ago, I think) for the current method (mostly complex
carbohydrate) when studies showed diabetic on the (then) new carb diet did
better than on those on low-carb diets.  Of course, perhaps the new low-carbs
methods are substantively different than the old ones.

This will have profound effects on your metabolism.  Below about 30 gms/day
your body cannot maintain the normal areobic chemistry cycle.  It switches to
another based on directly burning fat metabolites (this apparently normally
serves as a starvation metabolism).  This state is called ketosis, from the
ketones of fat metabolites that start floating about your bloodstream.
 Ketosis can make you drop weight like crazy.

>Later you raise your carb level to 40% of the

Again, a little caution here; in a high-protein diet most of the protein is
burnt for energy and the kidneys have to dispose of the nitrogenous wastes.
 Over a lifetime this appears to accelerate the natural decline of the
kidneys.  Kidneys are a bad thing to have trouble with as they tend not to
recover well; by the time you have symptoms you'd already be irreversably
quite ill.

However, I don't think this diet is greatly different from the current
standard american diet.

In response to Pat Fallon's long essay about the book on "Protein Power", I

A good rebuttal against creationists is something like : " Creation is the
ultimate bad theory because it can neither be reproduced nor disproven."*
It doesn't apply quite so well to spiritualism, though, but if you think
along these lines I'm sure you can come up with something. Good luck.

I have encountered similar situations.  Mystics are mystics.  Trying to
reason with someone who thinks they know all the answers, people who are not
seeking to discover what "reality" is, but rather seek mysticism, is futile.
 Once you've told them the idea of rationality, or how to observe, and make
opinions based on those observations, with the right to alter the opinions
with further evidence, then, if they haven't accepted the unprovability of
mysticism, they are beyond our help.  My advice is, once you determine
someone to be hopelessly irrational, only deal with them when neccessary.
 Seek other companions (ones who think).

>From Business Week, May 19:

If pierced navels are beginning to seem old hat to you, how about a
programmable tatoo? Interval Research Corp., a lab in Palo Alto, Calif.,
started by a group that includes Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, was
recently issued a patent for just such a device. It is a small
liquid-crystal display that is implanted beneath a layer of skin on the
wrist -- close enough to the surface to be visible. The device would
contain a control chip and small battery charged by holding the wrist near
an external charger. Interval researcher Andrew Singer says there should be
no health risks associated with wearing the device.

The most obvious application is a watch you never lose -- the LCD screen
shows the tiem. But Interval has more serious uses in mind. If biosensors
are placed on the device, for example, it can monitor the temperature and
blood pressure of a wearer with heart disease.

	For those who are looking for a rather mundane practical improvement (or
self-transformation) the dvorak keyboard is not too demanding and has some
benefits, the most important of which is less finger movement which
translates to less wear and tear on the joints and a faster typing speed. 
I am somewhat biased as dvorak is the first keyboard layout I learned to
"really" type on (I just had to be different) but it is definitely an area
that a frequent computer user should look into.  It took me about two weeks
to get adjusted to dvorak using a lesson plan (just a text file, but it
worked quite well) I found on one of the dvorak pages that can be found
through Yahoo.  I never finished the final lessons.  The last keys were the
most obscure so I learned them through use.

I think we are talking at cross-purposes. My point was that there appear to
be two factors at work: amount of fat and amount of calories appear to be
independent risk factors. That is:

A low-fat, low-calorie diet is better than,
A low-fat, high-calorie diet is better than
A  high-fat, high-calorie diet.

I don't really see how you can have a diet high in fat (in terms of actual
**amounts** of fat eaten) if you are on a low-calorie diet.

Large amounts of fat does all sorts of damage to the cardiovasular system
as well as increasing the risk of cancer. Lowering the amount of fat
reduces the amount of damage you can do. On the other hand lower calories
appears to be related to the slowing the aging process itself. I am not
sure whether this slowing only occurs when one passes a certain threshold
of calorie intake or whether at all stages a lower calorie intake implies
slower aging.

You seem to be arguing that there is no point going on a low-fat diet
unless you go on a low-calorie diet which I think is not only false, but
dangerous advice to many people since most aren't going to go on a calorie
restricted diet, but certainly could improve their health by better diet.

Please post the references to the studies you are citing.

No, and no mention of when it might be available. It shouldn't be too hard
to call Interval Research in Palo Alto though. Anyone in the local area
want to call them? Maybe they want to come and demo the programmable tatoo

Here's a data point: for a while I lived in a group house where we legalized
nudity by concensus.  When someone moved in who found it objectionable, we
stopped.  It was never a big deal.

I seem to recall that public nudity was unremarkable in western Europe until
roughly 1500.  Not that people went around all day in the nude, but it would
not be unreasonable to happen upon someone bathing or changing clothes in
public.  That's my recollection of what I read a while ago in "The History
of Manners" by Norbert Elias.  Unfortunatey, I read that in the first
volume, and now when I look on my bookshelves, I can only find the ^#^%&
second volume.

nude German college women 18-25 years old, in the sauna at the hotel.   My
puritanical meme took over and I left, embarrassed.  But, they paid me
absolutely _no_ notice and just kept on talking to each other.  Later, the

Americans distinguish between nudity and sex?"

I don't think the liver "decides" whether to turn food energy into glycogen
or fat. It may be the liver that converts food energy to glycogen or fat. If
your glycogen stores are depleted in your muscles or your liver, then the
food energy goes to replenish them. But if they are not depleted, how can it
store any more glycogen there? 

As i understand it, if you exercise and deplete your glycogen stores, then
when you eat the food energy will be preferentially used to replenish them.
If you have not been exercising and your glycogen stores are not depleted,
then if you eat a bid meal (especially one with a lot of carbs) the food
energy will be stored as fat.

requests that the present letter and the attached report be
circulated to all Member States as an official document of
the General Assembly.

Annex
Information about the appearance in Cuba of the Thrips palmi
plague.
I.- Description of the facts.
1-On 21 October 1996, at 10.08 hours, crew members of
  scheduled flight CU- 170 of Cubana de Aviacion (Cuban
  Airlines), on board a Fokker-27 aircraft, flying region
  of Cuba, noticed a single-engine airplane flying from
  north to south, at about 1, 000 feet (300 metres) above
  them, apparently spraying or sprinkling unknown
  substances - some seven times - in an intermittent
  manner.
2-At that very moment, Cubana de Aviacion Fokker aircraft
  was located 25 to 30 kilo metres south of Varadero, in
  Matanzas Province., flying at an altitude of 9, 000 feet
  and at a speed of 400 kilo metres per hour.
3-According to scheduled flights, objective radar control
  and recordings of radio conversations between the
  airplanes and ground control when the south in a course
  perpendicular to the Cubana de Aviacion flight was a
  fumigation aircraft Model SAR, register N3093M, of the
  civilian aircraft registry of the United States of
  America, operated by the State Department of that
  country, as stated in the flight authorization requested
  to the Institute registry of civilian aircraft . The
  above-mentioned airplane had taken off from Patrick
  United States Air Force Base, in Cocoa Beach in the state
  of Florida, bound for Grand Cayman.
4-The Cubana pilot immediately reported to flight control
  on the release of unknown substances, in the form of a
  white or greyish mist, by the SAR airplane. The Cuban air
  controller established communication with the United
  States aircraft and asked whether it was having any
  technical problem, to which the pilot's answer was "NO".
  He was also asked about the type of aircraft he was
  flying, answering that it was a single-engine AY-65. That
  conversation is recorded on tape.
5-On 18 December 1996, the first signs of the presence of a
  Thrips plague appeared in Matanzas Province, at potato
  plantations of the Diamant variety, sowed 38 days before
  on the "Lenin" State Horticultural Farm in Javelins
  Municipality.  Samples of these organism were sent to the
  Central Quarantine Laboratory of the National Pest
  Control Center.
6-On 26 December 1996, the Cuban ministry of Foreign
  Affairs presented a note of complaint to the United
  States Interest Section in Havana regarding the incident
  that had occurred in the Giron corridor, urging the
  United States party to take appropriate measures aimed at
  the clarification of the event.
7-On 12 February 1997, the United States Interest Section
  in Havana handed over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
  of Cuba a reply to that note, stating that on the day of
  the incident, the United states pilot had, during his
  flight, seen a Cuban commercial airplane flying below,
  and as he was nor certain of having seen, "following
  caution and safety procedures, and with the purpose of
  securing a positive visual contact, the pilot used the
  "smoke generator" of his aircraft, in order to indicate
  its location" adding that "the smoke vanished and no
  fluid was poured from the airplane".
8-On 14 February 1997, the Central Quarantine Laboratory
  confirmed that the insect examined was the Thrips palmi
  karay, exotic to Cuban territory until that moment.
9-The Thrips palmi is indigenous to Asia. Since 1985 it has
  scattered across certain Caribbean zones, including
  Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica. It is a
  polyphagous phytophagan that infects practically all
  crops, weeds and ornamental plants.  It is reported to be
  a vector of viruses such as that known as TSWV. It is an
  insect of difficult diagnosis, unknown to the majority of
  Cuban specialists. It is self-propagated within a field,
  and into neighbouring ones, disseminating mostly when
  seedlings, fruits and vegetal material, including
  topsoils, are moved from one place to another. It also
  scatters by aerial means, particularly its larvae. It is
  resistant to temperature changes. Its reproductive cycle
  lasts between 15 and 21 days, depending on the host
  plant.
10-    Taking into the levels of highest density of the
  insect population, it could be ascertained that the
  primary source of the outbreak was located on the above-
  mentioned "Lenin" State Horticultural Farm. Smaller
  outbreaks were pinpointed in fields close to the villages
  of Maximo Gomez and Bolondron, also in Matanzas Province,
  a few kilo metres away from the main source.
11-    In the first half of January 1997, outbreaks of the
  same insect were spotted in municipalities south of
  Havana Province, bordering Matanzas, affecting corn,
  beans, pumpkins, cucumbers and other crops.
12-    Once the insect was identified, the Government of
  Cuba adopted a programme of emergency measures to fight
  it, including chemical control, through the purchase of
  pesticides, which in spite of its high cost, have not
  achieved effective results.
13-    At the end of March 1997, The Government of Cuba,
  complying with international regulations, informed the
  Secretary-General and the United Nations Center for
  Disarmament, about the presence of Thrips palmi karay in
  its territory, and notified this finding to the Food and
  Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to
  which Cuba applied for technical and financial assistance
  to fight the pest.
14-    At present, Thrips palmi is spread virtually
  throughout Matanzas and La Habana Provinces, in two
  municipalities of Cienfuegos Province, in some
  municipalities of Pinar del Rio Province and in the
  Island of Youth. Its presence has not been detected in
  the central and eastern provinces of the country.

II.- RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS.
15-    The SAR aircraft, register N3093M, is used by the
  State Department of the United States in the struggle
  against drug trafficking, to destroy crops. The aircraft
  utilizes two sprinkling systems: one for the use of
  aerosols and liquid particles and another for dropping
  solid particles. No smoke generator is known to be
  installed aboard this aircraft.
16-    The specialists appointed by the Cuban party to
  clarify the event considered unlikely a voluntary or
  involuntary leakage of fuel or oil, which is confirmed by
  the answer given by the United States airplane pilot
  himself to the Cuban air controller.
17-    The argument used by the United States party in its
  note of reply regarding the smoke release, appears, from
  the technical point of view, weak and in contradiction
  with the conversation held during the flight. On the
  other hand it is not a standard procedure established for
  this kind of situation.  The pilot of the Cuban Airline
  Fokker asserts on the basis of his visual observation and
  his previous experience as a pilot of fumigation
  airplane, that the release made by the United states
  aircraft was not of smoke but of a substance.
18-    Bearing in mind the place where the unknown
  substance was released, it can be established that the
  most risky area for infection is a zone covering 15 to 20
  kilometres to the west and 20 to 25 kilometres to the
  east of the Giron air corridor, although the whole
  territory of Mananas Province is considered a probable
  infected zone. These zones match those actually infected
  both by the primary and secondary outbreaks.
19-    Considering the insect population found on 18
  December 1996, at the main source of the outbreak,
  specialists of the Cuban National Pest Control Centre
  estimated the beginning of the plague to date back to
  three or four previous generations.  Bearing in mind the
  reproductive cycle of this insect, the beginning of the
  infection can be ascertained as approximately 21 October
  1996, which was precisely the date when the United States
  S2R aircraft flew over this point.
20-    Mindful of the distribution of the agent in
  countries like Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica,
  it would be expected that any natural occurrence would be
  in the eastern region of Cuban territory, the closest to
  those countries.  Its appearance mora than 600 kilometres
  away from region is, therefore, odd and suspicious.
21-    Although at first sight it could be expected that
  the height of the flight of the S2R aircraft is not the
  most appropriate for the dissemination of biological
  agents, information is available regarding experiments
  made by North Americans themselves in which that type of
  agent was dropped from even higher altitudes. On the
  other hand, the enduring features of the insect, mainly
  in its larva state, make its survival possible at these
  altitudes.
22-    Because of its nature of being a polyphagous
  phycophagan that strikes and severely damages practically
  every crop, and is also resistant to a considerable
  variety of pesticides, the Thrips palmi can be considered
  ideal biological agents able to inflict heavy damage on
  agricultural food crops. In a document entitled "Report
  of the Subgroup for Investigation of Claims of Use or
  Escape of Agents which Constitute Biological or Toxin
  Weapons", of 29 February 1996, prepared by the Federation
  of American Scientists, Thrips palmi are included among
  the invertebrate that could come within the purview of
  the Convention on Biological Weapons.
23-    In this particular case, the behavior of the plague
  in Cuba shows a polyphagia bigger than the one described
  in the scientific literature.

III.- CONCLUSIONS.
24-    The analysis of the facts and the results of the
  investigations allow us to relate, with a high degree of
  accuracy, the appearance of Thrips palmi in Mananas
  Province with the dropping, on 21 October 1996, of an
  unknown substance by an aircraft operated by the United
  States Department.
25-    There is reliable evidence that Cuba has once again
  been the target of biological aggression.

The control of the various enzymes for glycogen synthesis and breakdown, for
fat synthesis and breakdown, and for glucose production are part of one of
these typically complicated feedback systems.  Most of this stuff takes place
in the liver and that's what I meant by "decides".  Glycogen stores don't
have a strict maximum, it's just that the more of it there is, the more the
enzymes tend to break it down and the less they tend to make it.

This is basically what's going on, except that I've never seen any indication
that the liver cares all that much about the type of food coming in.  The
liver is very good at interconverting the 3 forms (protein, carbohydrate, and
fat) and normally interconverts all of them all of the time.  The associated
energy loss is apparently negligeable.

Yes. The war in Bosnia was a product of western capitalist countries,
designed to change power structures in that region and to push arms
industry.

The wall in Germany fell because of massive media propaganda. Kohl
himself admitted this afterwards and said it would not have been
possible without western media. Of course hundreds of thousands of
unemployed people in East Germany would prefer socialism now.

That's simply not the case. Many tourists are disappointed after their
travel to Cuba because there was no single prostitute. Even in Havana
you will find hardly more prostitutes than in Berlin or Cologne.

A good economy is not only characterized by its growth or size, but also
by the distribution of wealth and the inequality. That's what
Libertarians always forget. And that's why people like you might mean
the end of this planet.

I can't remember any politician who said that war is a good thing. Most
of them just said it was necessary. Words are just words, and deeds are
deeds. The US aggression against Vietnam and other communist countries
was simply wrong (although a war can never be justified).

With 15 % poor people, low education standard, a rich power elite,
propaganda by TV religions and enterprise advertising, growing
inequality and a hardly existant welfare system, the US are one of the
saddest examples for free markets ins world history and will remind
anyone with a little bit of brain capacity of the Middle 
Ages.

Yes, there is a distinction between sex and nudity.  And Americans can
recognize that distinction.
Though cognizant of the distinction, I too become embarrassed when nude
before the masses.  You see, although sex and nudity are not the same, there
is a bridge between them.  
And I get embarrassed when I "erect" that bridge in public.

These people had a sudden change of government.  Give it time, and eventually
the economy will grow.  People who were raised for decades with "guaranteed
jobs and food" are going to have to adapt to capitalism.  I think the world
economies speak for themselves.  The real bottom line is a matter of rights -
Who's right is it to tell anyone else how to live?  The answer is - noone's.
 Having any form on government is ludicrous, especially a communist one.

Who cares if there is an unequal distribution of wealth.  Show me a large
group of people in which all people are equal in intelligence, creativity,
knowlege, experiance, and strength, and then I may agree with you.  People
are different, and will always have different amounts of money.  If you wish
to become a billionaire, shall we tell you that you can't because most people
aren't?

Thieves are the lower scum, while politicians are the higher scum.  They are
still scum.  Without governments, war cannot happen.  Case solved.  (I know
getting to that point will take a while, to say the least.  I'm just talking
pure theory, to be applied over the next few centuries, until we're there at
a pure state of anarcho-capitalism.)

I'm not familiar with a-albionic, but I do agree with you that the media
isn't free to print just anything.  They are very regulated.  Try to put

I agree completely, but let's look at CAUSE.  The cause of these problems is
not capitalism.  The cause is too much communism (PUBLIC schools, TAXES to
have PUBLIC SERVICES, etc.).  America is no ideal place to live, I agree.
 Just be sure to analyse the cause of its demise.

Well, "we" (the US and West Germany?) did exacerbate things by quickly
recognizing the freedom of the Croats and Bosnians to secede from
Yugoslavia, a right not granted by most gov'ts to their own people
(officially granted by the Soviet constitution, I think, but do we

Doesn't prove much.  A lack of prostitutes could mean that there are no
desperate women.  It could also mean that Cuba's police is much nastier
than our own, and thus more effective at getting rid of public
prostitution.

It takes a fair bit of chutzpah to call all of history ludicrous.  And
most people accept the right to tell their children what to do, at
least, and usually the right of a majority, especially when they feel
they are part of the majority.  The real bottom line is which society
makes people who can do something about being unhappy happier.
Anarchist theory looks very nice but is rather short on solid evidence.

"They are very regulated"?  By their private owners, perhaps.  You know,
the same institutions of private property extropians claim to support?
Or do you think the owners and reporters of the LA Times are chafing to

 You're right.  Sorry I forgot my E-Prime.  Politicians live by regulating
and ruling others, not by providing anything of real value.  They also try to
keep their power by creating unneccessary laws, etc, etc.

I recently begun taking Creatine and, according to the instructions, I
started with a "loading" phase.  Four tablespoons per day vs. 1
tablespoon per day with the latter being the maintanence dosage.  I am
trying the substance to see if it increases my performance in the
martial arts.

A friend of mine, who is a body builder and who ingests Creatine, told
me to skip the loading phase and take only the maintenance dosage
because after a month the Creatine level would be the same with either
approach.

Can someone comment on this?  I haven't read the book talked about in
Extropy
a few months past, I have only read some online literature which didn't
mention
skipping the loading phase.

Thanks,

*** China academy bans research into human cloning

The Chinese Academy of Sciences has banned all research into the
cloning of humans, saying sexual reproduction was fundamental for
survival of the species, the Xinhua news agency said Monday. The
agency quoted Academy Vice President Xu Zhihong as saying that
"banning the use of cloning to copy humans is absolutely necessary to
maintain ethical morality which holds together today's human society."
British scientists created the world's first cloned sheep in late
February, sparking controversy around the world. For the full text

I just read an article about creatine in Men's Health that seemed to
cover most of my questions.

	-.your muscles use oxygen to break down ATP into ADP-a slow proscess
compared to some other methods. In explosive muscle use the cell finds
other ways to make the converson.

	-Creatine is made in the liver, stored in the muscle, and is used to
make creatine phosphate which speeds up ATP regeneration.

	-you get about 1 gram per lb. of meat- alot less than most studies use
to gauge its effectiveness. 

	-most tests referred to in the article show improwed strength, power,
and faster recovery.

	-It's suggested that recreational athletes will not see it's full
benifits. Distance athletes may see decreased performance and it may not
affect some people at all.

	-There are few long term use studies looking at long term effects.

	-The article also talks about how and why you should load.

   Check out the article if you use the stuff- hope this helps!

       moderated group sci.cryonics (moderates existing group)

Newsgroups line:
sci.cryonics            Cryonics and related topics. (Moderated)

Votes must be received by 23:59:59 UTC, 29 May 1997.

This vote is being conducted by a neutral third party.  Questions
about the proposed group should be directed to the proponent.

Proponent: Joe Strout <jstrout@ucsd.edu>
Mentor: Jonathan Grobe <grobe@netins.net>

Votetaker: David Bostwick <bostwick@cas.chemistry.gatech.edu>

RATIONALE: sci.cryonics

The existing unmoderated group sci.cryonics has been suffering from a
decreasing signal/noise ratio.  In addition to the usual cross-posted
spam, there have been numerous personal attacks of a highly offensive
nature posted from anonymous remailers, as well as forged messages
apparently from legitimate members of the group.  This traffic is
damaging to the members of the group, as well as to the cryonics
community as a whole.  Changing the newsgroup from unmoderated to
moderated should greatly reduce the volume of such messages, and so
enhance the value of the group.

CHARTER: sci.cryonics

Cryonic suspension is an experimental procedure whereby patients who
can no longer be kept alive with today's medical abilities are
preserved at low temperature for treatment in the future.  This
newsgroup will be the place to keep up-to-date on topics related to
cryonics, which include biochemistry of memory, low temperature
biology, new cryonics-related research and publications, legal status
of cryonics and cryonically suspended people, nanotechnology and cell
repair machines, mass media coverage of cryonics, conferences, and
local cryonics group meetings.

Unacceptable messages include personal attacks, messages posted
without a valid sender address, and any message not pertaining to the
topics above.

IMPORTANT VOTING PROCEDURE NOTES:

Standard Guidelines for voting apply.  One person, one vote.  Votes
must be mailed directly from the voter to the votetaker.  Anonymous,
forwarded or proxy votes are not valid.  Votes mailed by WWW/HTML/CGI
forms are considered to be anonymous votes.

Vote counting is automated.  Failure to follow these directions may
mean that your vote does not get counted.  If you do not receive an
acknowledgment of your vote within three days contact the votetaker
about the problem.  It's your responsibility to make sure your vote
is registered correctly.  Duplicate votes are resolved in favor of
the most recent valid vote.  Addresses and votes of all voters will
be published in the final voting results post.

The purpose of a Usenet vote is to determine the genuine interest of
persons who would read a proposed newsgroup.  Soliciting votes from
uninterested parties defeats this purpose.  Please do not distribute
this CFV.  If you must, direct people to the official CFV as posted
to news.announce.newgroups.  Distributing pre-marked or otherwise
edited copies of this CFV is generally considered to be vote fraud.
When in doubt, ask the votetaker.

Extropy related business or company.  He is willing to work for either at
least $7 per hour or more, or just for food, housing, local transportation,
and a little spending money.  He is a hard worker, and would like to get to
California, but needs to have a job lined up first.  I told him I'd let the

Here's a note useful only to people within an easy drive of Silicon Valley:

It seems that there are lots of opportunities for group action among
those of us who want to radically extend our lives.  Let's get
together for a Sunday brunch to find out what people want to do.  

   When: 11am, Sunday, May 18
   Where: Fresh Choice
          2540 W. El Camino Real
          Mountain View, CA

This is near the intersection of San Antonio and El Camino.
For detailed directions, point your web browser at
http://www.zip2.com; their door-to-door directions are free and better
than anything I could provide here.  Hmm, they are down as I write
this -- I hope it is not permanent.

To get things started, here are some things we could do that arose from discussions at a recent Extropian party:

   Get together regularly and socialize.
   Take advantage of economies of scale in packaging & mixing vitamins.
   Share information about local doctors.
   Share information about suppliments and other life extension
      technologies.
   Help with cryonics paperwork.
   Actively recruit more people.

<snipped Cuban rant>

Sure, heard it all before.  Used to listen to Radio Moscow late at 
night while on tower duty on the East German border when I was is the 
U.S. Army in the early eighties.  I remember specifically that we 
were using chemical and biological weapons in Afganistan,  sabotaging 
Aeroflot airliners, building an earthquake machine to destroy the 
Motherland, runnning Nazi style deathcamps in Arizona, and kidnaping 
and murdering border guards late at night on infiltration missions.  
I can only speak from personal knowledge on the later:  we hardly 
ever kidnapped them, and the only torture I personally witnessed was 
when the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders went to OP Alpha on a USO tour, 
and those poor East German conscripts were stuck on the other side 
going out of their minds trying to get a look.

Several years later I  knew the Soviet Union was truely dead when I 
was again listening to shortwave and was totally shocked when what I 
thought was the BBC identified itself as Radio Moscow.  Used to be 
you could tell the difference in second.  Sometimes I almost miss the 
old one.  Almost.

That's the problem with propaganda, miss one vital fact and the
whole thing collapses.

Do you really expect anyone to believe that a crop spraying
aircraft bearing a U.S. State Dept registry was allowed to overfly
Cuba and dump anything without being shot down or at the very least
molested by Cuban Migs?

For the record, the U.S. isn't anti-Cuba, it's anti-communist, and
anti-Castro, and for good reason, or don't you recall that little
incident about attempting to install Soviet ICBM's 90 mile from our
shores?

Prediction: Communism will fall in Cuba when Castro does, and
relations will normalize shortly after that.....

    "Imperfect Computers"

    PHIL KUEKES and BRUCE CULBERTSON
    H P Laboratories

    Abstract:

    We have built a reconfigurable computer with 0.22 square meters of
    CMOS silicon in 864 chips, three quarters of which have known
    defects. The Teramac custom computer can be thought of as a giant
    programmable gate array with half a billion configuration bits.
    The large number of configuration bits and the two million wires
    available for routing make it very easy to place and route logic
    designs onto the physical network without depending on an unbroken
    symmetry in the physical network.
    
    Teramac is big enough to let us begin to explore some of the
    issues which will be faced by architects of the first nanoscale
    computers. How do we make a computer with nanometer scale
    components?  To make a computer we need not only small components
    but a method of connecting them in a reasonably arbitrary way,
    chosen by the computer designer.  Most self assembling strategies
    at the molecular scale create very regular structures which lack
    the complexity required of a computer.  More elaborate assembly
    strategies are likely to be very imperfect.  The topology of the
    Teramac interconnect is regular only in its fractal
    dimensionality. The place and route software does not depend on
    significant symmetry.  If you have enough wires and switches you
    can first build an imperfect machine and then design a perfect
    one.

 
    Hosts:  Norm Margolus and Tom Knight

    
This talk is part of a seminar series on adapting computers and
computations to the constraints of, and opportunities afforded by,
microphysics; and on the development and application of the physical
theory of computation and information.  This seminar series is
supported by the MIT AI Laboratory's Reversible Computing Project.

Dear Madam,

I can only give you a few figures which give an order of magnitude.
The Arithmom=E8tre, invented by Thomas de Colmar in 1820, was the first
practical, industrially-produced computing machine.
1821-1865 : 500 units produced in 44 years (in various workshops in Paris)
1865-1878 : 1 000 machines in 13 years
1865-1878 : 1 000 machines in 13 years.
60% were exported, of which a few hundreds to the USA. How many of them
were still in use in, say, 1880, for example ? and what percentage had been
destroyed or lost ? Without answering such questions, we cannot measure
"the computing machine calculations per person per year in the US".

This is a typical case where precision is incompatible with exactitude,
since there was no such thing as a statistics of statistical machines in
the 19th century, not even in the 1st part of our century.

Burroughs, with its three factories (11 000 employees) in US, Canada, UK,
sold 120 000 machines/year, in 1919, for a revenue of $ 33 234 000 ; in
1916 : 40 000 machines/year. Yet, Burroughs had many competitors, of which
most have not bequeathed us with their records. Even Burroughs' figures
(120 000...) are too square to be honest: They look more like commercial
propaganda than like real production statistics. So, I admire the bold
spirit whith which you plan to put together a chart!
I will try to find more data for you. Meanwhile, I would be very grateful
if you could tell me how you manage to solve the statistics problem!

Yours sincerely,

            MIT PHYSICS OF COMPUTATION SEMINAR

            Date: Tuesday, May 20 1997
            Time: 3:30 pm  (Refreshments after the talk)
            Room: MIT NE43, 8th floor AI Playroom (545 Tech Sq)


    "Imperfect Computers"

    PHIL KUEKES and BRUCE CULBERTSON
    H P Laboratories

    Abstract:

    We have built a reconfigurable computer with 0.22 square meters of
    CMOS silicon in 864 chips, three quarters of which have known
    defects. The Teramac custom computer can be thought of as a giant
    programmable gate array with half a billion configuration bits.
    The large number of configuration bits and the two million wires
    available for routing make it very easy to place and route logic
    designs onto the physical network without depending on an unbroken
    symmetry in the physical network.
    
    Teramac is big enough to let us begin to explore some of the
    issues which will be faced by architects of the first nanoscale
    computers. How do we make a computer with nanometer scale
    components?  To make a computer we need not only small components
    but a method of connecting them in a reasonably arbitrary way,
    chosen by the computer designer.  Most self assembling strategies
    at the molecular scale create very regular structures which lack
    the complexity required of a computer.  More elaborate assembly
    strategies are likely to be very imperfect.  The topology of the
    Teramac interconnect is regular only in its fractal
    dimensionality. The place and route software does not depend on
    significant symmetry.  If you have enough wires and switches you
    can first build an imperfect machine and then design a perfect
    one.

 
    Hosts:  Norm Margolus and Tom Knight

    
This talk is part of a seminar series on adapting computers and
computations to the constraints of, and opportunities afforded by,
microphysics; and on the development and application of the physical
theory of computation and information.  This seminar series is
supported by the MIT AI Laboratory's Reversible Computing Project.

Hmm, just something I noted (see Daniel Kershbaum's post for an aswer
to your question): we seem to talk a lot about different substances
on this list, but it is important to distinguish them from each
other. Nootropics are "smart drugs", drugs intended to boost mental
(cognitive) performance. Creatine is intended to boost physical
performance, a category I have not yet found any good name for
(doping is a bit charged and specific in scope, maybe somatotropic
drugs would work?). Then there are the psychotropic drugs (changes
the mind in general), and the life extension drugs. Are there any
more commonly discussed categories?

Hmm.  Your comment provokes several reactions.

The first is due to the fact that my wife and I are expecting a boy in 
mid-September.  This obviously places both of us in the category of 
moron, at least according to you.  So I'd like to think that my example 
disproves your blanket statement right off the bat ;-)

Digging beyond the gut-level response, I'll admit that I had reservations 
for many years about bringing a child into the world.  Look around - the 
forces of big government seem to be entrenched around the world, children 
are being shot on the streets and in schools, couples are having to work 
harder to make ends meet, etc.  I could go on and on.  It seems like the 
world is going down the toilet, and that things just aren't as good as 
they were when I was growing up.

At some point, though, I began to suspect that these views were primarily 
due to my getting older, that the big bad world was making me cynical, 
and that maybe the world wasn't actually getting measurably worse.  I 
also began to suspect that perhaps most parents of most generations, for 
as far back as mankind has been living in civilized society, have felt 
that things wouldn't be as good for their children as they were when they 
themselves were growing up.

So now I try to invoke my Extropian dynamic optimism.  Yes, things are 
bad in many ways in many places, but there are also many good 
developments being made at a seemingly increasing pace.  Yes, I'm 
throwing myself and my child into a bit of a crapshoot, but I have hope 
that the forces of freedom and scientific advancement will prevail.

Here's a counter-argument for you.  If forward-thinking types like us 
don't counter the reproductive forces of the moronic masses, at least to 
some degree, aren't we just making it more certain that those forces will 
prevail?  Who knows, my kid could be the next Max More!

There's the other line of discussion about whether or not one can best 
achieve immortality through one's genes or one's memes.  In other words, 
how much is one limiting one's advancement and personal development by 
settling down into family life?  I struggled with this one too, and have 
come to the conclusion that I want to have, and think I can accomodate, 
both.  I know that I have developed quite a bit by being married, and I 
expect that being a father will offer many new opportunities to grow.  So 
I'll hopefully end up being a better, more effective person, and will be 
bringing a potential new Extropian into the world to boot.

Along those lines, does anyone have any suggestions for how to raise a 
successful, Extropian child?  Are there any particularly good books, web 
sites, etc. out there?

Subject: Is Software Generality Overrated?
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

A computer has beat the best human at Chess.  Once again we have
passed another long-forseen milestone toward AI.  And again it was
accomplished by a relatively focused and non-general system, and by
more standard software engineering (rather than some "AI"ish approach
intended to implement more general agents).

Now clearly it will one day be possible to create software whose
reasoning abilities and breadth of skills are as broad and general as
humans, if not more general.  But I'm wondering: how long this day be
put off by tradeoffs between the costs and benefits of generality?

On the benefit side: we already have humans who can't use much of
their generality.  People can learn to do a remarkably wide variety of
things.  But a standard lament is of people who must spend all day
doing some narrow task, but long to express all the other sides of
themselves.  People like me leave promising careers in one field
because we're bored and want to do something new for a while.  People
fight to move up heirarchies where they can take a broader view.

On the cost side: It can be very expensive to make software able to do
a wide variety of different tasks.  It costs in speed of execution,
and in time to write, test, and maintain the code.  People have a huge
"common sense" knowledge base to draw on, and writing it all down for
computers is a daunting task.

If the most general reasoning in combined human-computer systems
continues to be done by people, and computers take the more routine
specific tasks, then the generality boundary between computer and
human reasoning may move slowly.  Yes computers get faster, but people
also learn more about how to do general tasks well, including how to
program and use computers.  Eventually we will learn how to speed up
and further modify human brains, and if this day comes soon enough,
computer AI may never displace humans at the general tasks.

P.S. I seem to recall a "lightfoot" panel in UK that came to a similar
conclusion about AI research on the early 70s.  Any sources on this?

Creatine:  Creatine is a nutrient found in our bodies, and made from a
combination of three amino acids:  arginine, glycine and methionine.
Creatine helps provide energy for muscle growth.  When muscles contract, the
fuel power is called ATP, adenosine triphosphate.  We need to rev-up the ATP
supply to make muscles.  To produce more ATP, creatine phosphate can be
taken as a supplement.  Creatine also helps to make proteins within the
muscle fibers.

Loading:  Loading means to divide the creatine supplement into phases.  By
loading, we build up the muscle fibers' storage supply. Do this for a week
(or so) and then reduce intake.  There are different loading methods, and I
would suggest that you read about it on the Internet.  You will also have to
experiment for yourself. There is a really clear and easy to understand
loading table in Ray Sahelian's book _Creatine_ (you can find it on the
Internet.)

Each person is different, and each body builder will respond differently to
loading phases.  I had to keep my grams small because of nausea.  There is a
new supplement out that combines protein a creatine that I plan to purchase
quite soon.  This product, produced by "Pinnacle" has the creatine mixed
into it, so one doesn't have to dissolve the creatine in boiling water and
drink it this way.

Well, we'll soon know that David Brin isn't on the list, by his failure
to erupt in response.  So I'll stand in.  World is going down the
toilet?  The world is growing out of the toilet.  Maybe some things are
worse than when you were growing up.  I'm only 22; what's changed in my
life is the collapse of much of the Eastern bloc and a lot of advances
in science and technology.  Along with more democracy in Latin America
and somewhat better conditions in South Africa.  I live in a country
with First and Second Amendments, even if they're not absolute; where
anyone can make fun of any politician or anyone else without legal
sanction; where social respect is largely correlated with wealth (a
better proxy for respect for ability than respect for who your parents
were, or what accent you have); where one can still get a cheap
homestead and live on it in the middle of nowhere, if one wishes and can
live away from the main economy.

And most people accept that things should be getting better, even if
they think that's not currently the case.  As Brin says, we're the first
civilization to have our Golden Age in our future.  And we're making
measurable progress toward it, even if extropians have somewhat less
mainstream ideas of what the golden age should be.  We're on the top of
the world.  Only some rulers of previous societies had more control over
reality than we do; and except for the ability to boss around people's
lives, most of them don't match up either.  I don't think Augustus had
glass windows.  He sure didn't have kiwi fruit available year round.  Or
printing presses.

Prohibition: the Sequel, decrepit inner cities, the deficit, and the IRS
aren't nice features of current reality.  They also are far from the end
of the world.

I know you, John, came to less pessimistic realizations.  But this is a
general thing: for libertarians or transhumanists to not acknowledge
that they are living in the best of all places and times *that have
actually existed so far* is going to get them _justly_ dismissed as
nutty dreamers.  Not visionary dreamers, just nuts.

This news release, which was issued minutes ago by Caltech, bears directly
on claim GRBr. It reports results that argue strongly for a very distant
origin for at least one gamma-ray burster.

Um, "Algernon's Law" was invented by me, not the (mouse) Algernon.  Nor
does it yet occupy the Theory/Hypothesis spectrum; that applies only to
individual Algernic modifications, not Algernon's Guideline in general -
which is aiming for a position in cognitive science similar to that of
TANSTAFFL in politics, or Murphy's Law in engineering.  I.e, you can
fool it six ways from Sunday, but you'd damn well better know about it
to begin with.  Anyway...

There are three basic ways an intelligence enhancement can be an
evolutionary disadvantage; Galileo-martyrdom, biological limits, or
cognitive tradeoffs.

The first is the Galileo-martyrdom theory of genius.  That is, the
intelligence enhancement either (1) causes the person to be lynched by
an angry mob or (2) causes the person to realize there are more
important things in life than reproduction.  Although this is a favorite
note of science-fiction authors, many conditions would have to be
satisfied before we could say with confidence that the only downside of
some nootropic was that you'd be SO smart the normals just couldn't take
it any more.  Like, the nootropic tampers with the serotonergic systems
and turns you into a megalomaniac genius.  Even that wouldn't be enough,
frankly, because it's too easy to ask why this form of genius requries
some random emotional state.

If the nootropic makes a specific chemical change that causes you to
lose interest in reproduction, then that's fine - although, as above,
one would have to show that this was *inherent* *to* *the* *advantage*,
and not just a side effect of the particular chemical used - otherwise,
why hasn't a similar but less devastating drug been invented by
evolution long ago?  An example might be an improvement to the
goal-processing system that causes the Algernon to dispassionately and
perfectly evaluate the justification of every goal; such a person might
not be responsive to his evolutionarily tuned, unjustified emotions.

Next come biological limits, such as brain size/hip width.  Or neuron
number/metabolic energy consumed.  A genuine nootropic would probably
work by bypassing one of these limits.  Example:  Although this isn't a
pill-type nootropic, it's still "add-to-brain" material, and the most
obvious of all:  Extra brains.  Clone yourself, take the fetal neural
tissue.  (Before it forms a brain, of course!  a) ethics b) won't
integrate.)  Maybe you'd need to expand the skull somehow, maybe not;
maybe the neurons would integrate, maybe not; it's still worth trying, I
say.  And the reason brains haven't grown before is, of course, that the
head would be too big to get out of the birth canal.

Similarly, a nootropic that caused neurons to double in speed (or
plasticity) at the expense of octupling energy consumed would also get
around Algernon's Law.  You might need to walk around with a
refrigerator on your head, or you might keel over from your heart
beating twice as fast (until it all adjusted), but modern medical
science could probably see you through it.

Cognitive tradeoffs, however, are the main thrust of Algernon's Law. 
Too many old-time science fiction novels had Miraculous Brain
Stimulators that just poured electricity into some section of the brain
and, ta-da, your IQ doubled.  This isn't the reason I invented
Algernon's Law, but it is the reason I felt it had to be published:  I
was afraid that at some point in the near future, some wannabe
transhuman would stick a wire into his frontal cortex, pour in the
juice, and expect to be turned into a superman.  (I did NOT think
Algernon's Law was absolute, most of the workarounds/disproofs I get are
actually pointed out on the Web page, and Algernon's Law is a tool, not
a message of despair.  OK?)

Well, as is not surprising, pouring juice into the frontal cortex
actually degrades performance by adding noise.  Proof by induction: 
They used induction to stimulate currents in the frontal cortex and
performance went down.  Part of "Algernon's Law: The Web Page" deals
with where you pour the juice in to actually stimulate some ability. 
(Answer:  The limbic system - emotions can trigger cognitive abilities
and can be evoked by electrical current.)

So, that being said, what happens when you "stimulate" some ability?  My
answer is that this ability consumes more than its fair share of
cognitive resources that would ordinarily be distributed evenly among
many abilities.  For the sake of discussion, let's suppose that two
mental abilities use a "search tree" among identical subject material,
but one mental ability works best with a wide, shallow, breadth-first
search, while another works best with a narrow, deep, depth-first
search.  If the "stimulation" locks ability A on "always on", ability B
will suffer, because - again by hypothesis - neural formations are not
easily reprogrammable serial computers; a given connective architecture
is either wide and shallow or narrow and deep.  Thus, each ability can
prosper only at the expense of the other.

Moreover, any artificial amplification will result in a net evolutionary
disadvantage, in this case for deep mathematical reasons.  In search
trees, doubling the resources available results in a small increase in
performance.  A tree of depth 10 and breadth 2 consumes 1000 neurons. 
Add another thousand neurons and the new tree is only of depth 11 - a
10% increase from a doubling of resource.  So say one ability uses a
million-neuron tree of depth 10 and breadth 4, while another uses a
million-neuron tree of depth 5 and breadth 16.

Locking ability A into position at the expense of B - assuming the
entire neural resources of B are devoted to A - will result in a trivial
increase in ability A - around .5 depth in the first case, and a 2.2
increase in breadth for the other.

The basic framework may vary from ability to ability, but the message of
Algernon's Law is the same:  "Things are the way they are for a reason;
the human brain was designed by evolution to operate at capacity, and
you can't get huge performance increases by wishing for them, any more
than you can speed up a computer by doubling the wattage.  You have to
actually add resources, and then you have to explain why evolution
hasn't added them already."

So - what nootropics might actually work, getting around Algernon's
Law?  I see a few:

1)  Additional neurons.  Either fetal neural tissue transplants or
something that coaxes the nerve tissue into regenerating - though the
latter is suspect.  (You might run a 85% risk of brain cancer.)

2)  High-speed neurons.  Maybe a drug that myelinates all the
unmyelinated neurons, or a complex nanotechnological fix replacing
neurons with transistors and axons with optical fibers.

3)  Increased plasticity.  A drug might cause the brain to revert to
childhood, temporarily decreasing actual intelligence, but vastly
increasing one's ability to learn.  Or the drug might delay puberty
until age 22; I think that would be a wonderful idea.  Teenagers, after
all, are the result of having all these physically mature but
not-ready-to-join-society types around.

4)  Altered states of consciousness.  The brain is full of
evolutionarily advantageous distractions such as boredom, lust, and so
on.  A nootropic might remove the ability to be bored - although one
would have to be careful that boredom didn't stimulate some mental
ability.  Removing frustration, for example, would be very iffy indeed. 
But some high-tech derivative of cocaine, without being addictive or
pleasurable, might still give programmers the ability to work frantic
16-hour days for years on end without even beginning to feel "burned
out".  See David Pearce's "The Hedonistic Imperative", my own discussion
of "Iron-Willed Algernons", and a certain hyperoptimistic member of this
list.

5)  One might also lock some given ability on high - not to enhance it,
but simply because cognitive research has shown that that is the best
approach to some problem.

6)  Finally, there's my original proposal - lock some ability on high,
and if this nukes out half the brain, deal with it.  Would you sacrifice
your ability to understand "Godel, Escher, Bach" if it would make you
the world's greatest designer of program architectures?  Would you do it
if *someone* with ability of that level was needed for us to make it to
the Singularity?  Call 1-800-555-SURE or 1-800-555-NOPE to register your

Actually it was a tool to prop up production and sales of Russian arms
in the face of lessening western aid to Russia for economic conversion.
SInce the Russians were dragging their feet in conversion, we cut back
aid, so they started pumping arms sales to Serbia.

So the fact that resources in Cuba are reserved for Communist Party

The media is free, but it is biased. I can say whatever I want here,
publish it, even send a letter to the editor and expect it to be printed
(just look at all the letters that creationists and even Tim McVeigh
have had published). I can do all this here and not be afraid of being
"dissapeared" for it. What is not guarranteed is that anyone will be
interested enough to listen, or to believe what I say.

Reminds me of a Dilbert cartoon. Gee, if you get rid of the poorest 15%,
you will still have a poorest 15%, which you can do over and over until
the richest people are part of the poorest 15%.

The "growing inequality", whill accurate, is disingenuous. Just because
the rich are getting richer does not mean that the poor are getting
poorer. In our case, it means that the poor are not getting richer as
fast as the rich are getting richer. Despite the propaganda you have
been brainwashed with, most especially from liberal media sources, the
poor are definitely NOT getting poorer here.

What I was getting at was the stats that show that poorer and less
educated people tend to have more children than educated affluent
people, which explains why the "explosion" in world population really
only exists in undeveloped or underdeveloped nations. Seeing as how much
health care technology benefits the life expectancy of poor people much
more than rich people, despite increasingly high costs of service,
technology seems to in this respect act as a governor on natural
evolution, providing negative feedback that allows less successful
strains to survive and reproduce, which brings us back to the old social
darwinism thread. Given the decreasing influence of natural selection in
our species due to the benefits of health care technology, one would
argue that our society should evolve to enhance or encourage increased
selectivity in other aspects of our culture. The shift toward more open
free markets is one indication that this is happening. Unfortunately,
while natural selection conveniently killed off unsuccessfull strains,
we have the unsuccessful strains hanging around taking up space,
resources, and bandwidth. This winds up expending the evolutionary
"inertia bank" on a faster and faster basis. Before I start to sound too
ghoulish, I'm not too worried about it, as I know that once space travel
becomes more viable, enough to be able to colonize, we will have a new
big filter. Still and all, my statement was a reflection of my noticing
that of all the people I grew up with, while most of the smart ones are
just starting to settle down and start families, the morons are already
married, divorced, with 2-4 kids. Makes me want to lobby for birth
licenses.

Of course. Until we can upload multiple copies, or clone bunches of

A while back in our cloning discussions, I think that I read some 
excellent statements on the extropian viewpoint regarding this new 
technology.

I'd like to get a few statements from those who were involved in the 
discussion for the purpose of writing a short article for a political 
web magazine that has asked me to represent the futurist viewpoints on 
various topics.  Very nice of them to do so, as they could have 
restricted their scope to the usual range of 
progressive-to-conservative.  Good chance to spread a few memes!

Feel free to email off list.

Thx,

Yes, and maybe `writing it down' explicitly is the wrong way to go, but
hey--  The CYC system, last time I looked, was said to have swallowed a
human-century of input, and not yet got all that far.  Still, using an
amazingly rich organic neural net a human takes between 7 and 35 years to
absorb the tacit knowledge needed for true functioning intelligence.
That's *every single human*.  Once the knowledge base is compiled,
compressed and debugged, AIs can (presumably) be die-stamped.  That might
lead to dangerous conformity, so their common sense paradigms will need to
be kept somewhat labile, but the advantages of xeroxing over long drawn-out
experience seem to me to represent a truly gigantic jump forward in low
cost utility.

Yes, it must be outside agitators, I certainly can't think of any other
explanation why people would be unhappy to live in a totalitarian country. 
The western agents are not just demagogues, they're also skillful actors, 
they can scream just as if they were being tortured, make themselves look

Very talented fellows, but evil of course.

Absolutely. The idea that Castro could be interested in power for its own
sake is pure libel, a lie concocted by those nasty media people and financed
by big business and aliens in the spaceship following comet Hale Bopp.

Everybody knows that that you'll never find a nicer bunch of people than 
dictators, I can't think of even one example from History where they've been 
anything but true humanitarians, kind, gentle, nurturing and brilliant 
economists. They only want to help people, power is not important to a tyrant. 
A day without Castro is like a day without sunshine.

North Korea? NORTH KOREA!!! Erik, I know you consider individual freedom to

you think that virtue totally compensates for it also being one of the poorest 
most backward places on Earth? Do you really want to hold up this hellhole as

too much", is this the direction you want us to go?

Some might say that if you want to be prosperous then treat your main

trading with you, but of course these unenlightened people don't understand
the glories of socialism and dictatorship.

And to think, the dupes of the western media thought the war was
caused by centuries of religious and ethnic strife. I'm sure big business
started the war somehow, I just don't know how, and lots of companies 
made a fortune off it, I just can't think of one.

Do you think a wall and a policy of shooting people in the back if they
try to climb it when they attempt to escape a workers paradise is appropriate 
behavior, or would this sort of thing be better suited for a prison?
Assuming for the sake of argument that what you say is true, Is the fall of
the wall supposed to make us think that the western media did a bad thing?

This Libertarian has not forgotten it, in fact I think redistribution of
wealth is a fine idea, provided of course I get to do it. I'd be real good 
at determining who has too much money and who doesn't have enough,
I'd be real good. I promise I'll never use my power for personal gain, 
heaven forbid, I only want to do good. You can trust me, I never lie,
I'll be just as fair as Castro or Stalin.

Actually, the Soviets were installing SS-4s, which are ballistic missiles,
but not ICBMs.  They did have a throw-weight substantial enough to deliver 1
MT warheads, though.  
Of course, in reality, the entire affair may not have had anything to do with
basing missiles.  The incident was more likely about keeping the United
States out of the Soviet's new "forward deployment base" than about keeping
the missiles there.

	Recently we finished reading the 1200 page tome "Chronicles of the 20th
Century.  We used it as a bathroom book, so each trip to the John allowed
us to read a day by day account of what the world, especially the United
States, was doing.  It is amazing how what was being done by various
governments then would be unacceptable today.  In many ways we "growing
up".  But throughout history there have been people who want "a piece of
the action" without contributing to the action.  Someone controls a pass to
the market and if you want to take your goods to the market you must pay
them in order to do so, etc.  Over and over again the same scenario is
repeated; those merchants who are established want to prevent competition
and/or gain a special privelage and they use government to do so.  All the
wars are just organized gangs of thieves using the people as cannon fodder
so the established merchants will prosper even more.  Until there is a
"Seperation of State and Market" this scenario will continue.  We may not
have wars as intense as before (the establishment could actually get hurt
the next time around), but we will have trade wars or government
regulations to achieve the same end.  Keeping in mind the real purpose of
government (to protect the established businesses), we may wish to
reexamine history, if necessary, to see that Communism and Capitalism are
both ideas which function without the State.  When the State is involved in
either of these ideas the ideas become corrupted.  There has never been an
armed struggle between these two ideas, only struggle between groups
wanting a piece of the action.  Merchantilism (with a small group of
wealthy merchants) called Capitalism has been on one side; Socialism, (with
a small group of politicians) called Communism has been on the other side. 
Both groups were greatly enriched by using the State.  Now there is such a
mix of Mechantilism and Socialism that there is not much difference between
various countries, only in degree.  Socialism appears to be the modern
version of the Roman circuses; give the masses something to keep them
satisfied while you are stealing from them.
	The United States did not go to war in 1917 to keep the World safe for
Democracy.  Our excuse for getting into that war was to bring up, on April
6th 1917, the sinking of the Lusitania on May 15th,1915.  The United States
did not go to war in 1941 to keep Herr Hitler from running Europe, they
were attacked by Japan, an ally of Germany.  Germany had a free hand to
occupy Poland, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, Holland, France, Yugoslavia and
Greece by June 1941.  Their ally Italy, and "fellow fascist" Franco in
Spain pretty much put most of Europe into the same camp.  If the U.S. was
trying to stop Hitler from "running Europe", they would not have stood by
while he marched into Prague on the Ides of March, 1939, or when he invaded
Poland on September 30th of the same year.  The Second World War allowed
the United States to rise from the Depression and to allow government to
interfere in peoples lives as they had never done before; all with the
excuse that "we are at war".
	With the seperation of the State and the Market, the causes of war would
cease, including the War on Drugs and other victimless crimes.  Governments
would cease to be a tool of the "established businesses", donations would
dry up, most regulations would be scuttled, and people would be more in
charge of their own lives.  Governments would naturally shrink drastically.
	A few years ago an economist won the Pulitzer for showing the correlation
between government regulation and efficiency of the economy; any
interference makes it less efficient; the more interference the more
inefficient it becomes.  So why is interference tolerated?  Tradition.  And
we all know that "Tradition is easier than thinking."  Let's hear it one
more time for Seperation of State and Market.

The problems in Eastern Germany and other recently communist countries is 
a legacy of COMMUNISM, not capitalism. I don't understand why people 
can't get this. Look, people under the rule of a communist regime have it 
beaten into them for their entire lives that they are dependant upon the 
state. And since communist states control every aspect of the economy, 
they pretty much enforce a situation in which all their citizens must 
turn to the state for all their needs. These poor people have had most of 
their personal initiative driven by a systematized destruction of their 
individuality.

Is it any surprise, then, that the economies of these countries would 
suffer? The system of capitalism provides no over-arching power 
structures to tell people what to do. Productive companies are the result 
of people having ideas and goals and accomplishing them to benefit 
themselves. The communists chased these ideas of selfishness and personal 
initiative out of their citizens by force and propaganda. All production 
of essential goods and services was regulated by the state. Any property 
of any value whatsoever (like all apartment buildings, factories, etc.) 
was owned by the state. The state set all production and consumtion rates 
- again by force and propaganda. Personal initiative was rewarded by the 
nationalization of productive companies.

Capitalism is a very complex idea that we take for granted. Ideas don't 
just spring fully developed into the minds of people. Freedom, and the 
attitudes and ideals that the state of freedom brings also just do not 
materialize into people's heads. The ideas the one can work to benefit 
oneself, that in individual has the right to the fruits of his labor, and 
that the state is there to protect the people against force and fraud - 
these have to be taught. The citizens of formerly communist countries 
have to learn. It will take time.
 
It is unbelievable to me that anyone is still advocating variants of 
socialism. If one is interested in the results of socialist systems, one 
need merely look at history - it's one grand controlled experiment. Let's 
start now, and work our way backwards. Look at the socialist experiments 
of most of the European contries - they are crumling. The medical, 
welfare, and worker's benefits packages are strangling most of the bugets 
of these countries. Most European countries are rapidly privatizing many 
functions formerly performed by the public sectore.

Fidel Castro has reluctantly allowed the creation of 'free enterprise 
zones' in many areas of Cuba to help lower unemployment. Hmmmm.... Seems 
like capitalism is OK if it generates wealth that the communist 
goverments can then steal.

OK - now back a bit further. Remember Pol Pot and Ieng Sary? They both 
ran a controlled experiment. They wanted to see what happened if they 
forced a system of agrarian Maoism upon the people of Cambodia. They did 
it in a matter of months. What happened? Within weeks, upwards of 30% of 
the people in the experiment were dead from torture, disease, starvation, 
and exhaustion from forced labor. Ooops - looks like the controlled

I could go on. Perry has talked about the interesting North-South Korean

A quite Extropian take on cloning appears in the most recent issue of Wired,
from the pen of none other than Microsoft's Chief Technology Officer, Nathan
Myhrvold.  See Nathan Myhrvold, In Vitro Veritas, Wired at 109-10 (June
1997). 

The powerful and at points quite innovative argument proceeds thusly:

1) Many people object to cloning--but why?

2) We already reproduce with technology, and nearly clone via it.

3) Cloning already happens via happenstance.

4) "Fear of clones is just another form of racism."  [Interesting point, eh?]

5) "The most upsetting possibility in human cloning isn't superwarriors or
dictators.  It's that rich people with big egos will clone themselves. . . .
So what?  Rich and egoistic folks do all sorts of annoying things . . . ."
 [Ha, ha!]

6) "The 'deep ethical issues' about cloning mainly boil down to jealousy."
 [In fact, they boil down to *envy*--a related but distinctly different
emotion, and one that NM in fact means to cite.]

7) Science good; ignorance bad.  [The actual language nicely mixes poetry and
irony.]

NM's Idee Forte ought to appear online eventually, if it has not already, at
www.wired.com.  The magazine notes that a fuller version of the piece appears
at www.slate.com/CriticalMass/97-03-13/CriticalMass.asp.

Yes.  In particular the essential amino acid Lysine is deficient
in plant proteins.  Lysine can prevent glyco-sylation in ageing
and (IIRC) is important for strong muscles and immune function.

In talking with vegans I am always surprised that so frequently
they are unaware of this possible deficiency.  If the vegan
diet is restricted (perhaps to lose weight) lysine deficiency
is almost inevitable.

With uploads, this advantage will apply to us as well.  So the
question is: will common sense be compiled before uploads appear?

Subject: Found the Baryons: they're ionized
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk

A big week for astrophysics!

Science 9May97 p.899 describes an article in the current Astrophysical
journal, which gives a plausible theory of where all the baryons are,
and of the Lyman-alpha forest of Quasar absorption lines. 

Simply assume a log-normal distribution of density in the universe,
which is consistent with simulations and simple theory.  Given lots of
ambient hard radiation, such as from quazars, the low density rgions
are highly ionized, and so are transparent to ordinary light.
Fitting this model to actual Quasar absorption lines can account for
all the baryons expected from primordial nucleosynthesis.  

So now we just need to find out what/where the non-baryonic dark
matter is.

I have not yet seen any good resources for extropian child rearing,
but it sounds like a void which we have to fill. 

Here is my personal tip: whenever the child asks "why?" try to
answer, or explain that you don't know. Always answer, or direct the
child to an information source.

I was heavily influenced by Bucky Fullers early books particularly "An
Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth ". It's a little dated but very
extropian for it's time.
This leads me to wonder what motivates people to identify with
transhmanist groups? Any thoughts?

I have done my very best to answer every single question my 3 1/2 year old
daughter asks.  This is surprisingly difficult, espescially since she enjoys
questioning every answer with a "why?".  It runs something like this:

"Papa, what's this?"
"It's an ice cream maker."
"Why?"
"Because it was built to make ice cream."
"Why?"
"Because people want ice cream makers, so other people build them."
"Why?"
"Money.  People who want ice-cream makers will pay money to other people to
build them."
"Oh.  Let's make ice cream!"
"Not now, sweetie."
"Why?"
"It's almost dinnertime, and I don't want you to spoil your appetite."
"Why?"
"Because if you ate sweet ice cream before dinner, you wouldn't eat the
non-sweet dinner food, and you wouldn't grow up big and strong."
"Why?"
"Because we grow better when we eat things that aren't sweet."
"Why?"
"Evolution.  Cave people didn't eat sweets."
"Oh.  I want dinner now, so we can make ice cream right away soon!"
"Okay.  Let's wash hands first."
"Why?"
"We always wash hands before dinner.  It's a rule."
"Why?"
"Because if there's dirt or poo-poo on your hands, and it gets in your food,
you might get sick."
"Why?"
"Because there are tiny animals in dirt that sometimes grow inside people
and make them sick."
"Eeuw-yuck-pooie. Why?"
"Evolution."
"Oh."

I find that these why-chains always end up at one of the following ultimate
answers:

"Money."
"Evolution."
"It's a law of physics."
"Chance."
"Nobody knows."
"I don't know, but <insert name> does."

Rachel doesn't really know how money, evolution, or physics work, but she's
used to the notion that they are the underlying causes of things, so later
when she learns about them, she'll have the right attitude.

I suppose what makes me an Extropian child-rearer is that I never use any of
these old standbys:

"God made it that way."
"Because I say so."
"It just is."
"You wouldn't understand."
"Good little girls don't ask so many questions."

I am willing to go over her head, if I have to, rather than leave a question
unanswered.  But I've always found stuff that was over my head very
educational, so why should I deny that to her?  It's amazing how she retains
stuff that must seem like random gibberish to her, only to connect it later
to something else.

--CarlF

PS.  The why-chains last between three and six steps before grounding out in
one of the root causes.  Does this tell us something about ontology,
something about epistemology, or nothing important?

My experience was that I was already sympathetic to many extropian ideas
upon my first exposure.  I was floored by the similarities between myself and
the weirdos in Cali as I flipped though the 10/94 Wired in a grocery
store.  The notion of furthering and accelarating human evolution had been
brewing in me for a few years.  In '93 I wrote a screen play
about a man and his wife who had themselves placed in cryonic supspension.
When they were revived, the plot centered around the man's decision to
have himself up-loaded, and thus evolve into another species (his wife
suffered water damage and had to be uploaded immediately after thawing).
Had I considered that I may make the same journey as my protagonist, as I
do now, the story would have been much better.

Another important factor in my exposure to extropian memes, was the
industriousness and optimism of the people that Regis wrote about in that 
article.  At the time I was at psychological/emotional global minimum.  It
was inspiring to read of people with whom I shared many ideas (though not
totally-- I was an uninformed collectivist at the time, but Ayn Rand took
care of that silliness), and who were producive and happy, two
crucial things I was not at the time.  I'm Much better now ;-).

Yet another drawing factor was my inclination towards the extraordianry
and weird. Such things very often lead me away from the masses.  Its a
natural tendency I have that I can trace back to the
first grade.  As now I count myself among their ranks, Extropians no longer
seem strange, but we're definately extraordinary!

So my generic profile would be someone who was already sympathetic to >H
memes, an inclination to leave the pack, and has the desire to be productive. 
At least in this stereotype, a potential >H already has the neural
architecture that such memes thrive in.  

On a side note, I wonder if a healthy human gene pool contains a handful
of alleles that incline their bodies/brains toward novelty.  Such
individuals may have just enough reproductive success to keep novelty
seeking alleles in a populations genome, and just enough creativity to
introduce new technologies/memes (at the risk of ostracism (sp?)) that
would increase their fitness either directly, or indirectly by helping the
group. Considering how long hominids used the same tools, such a novelty gene 
would probably be a relative newcomer (past 100K yrs?).  Just a thought.

Exovivo!

I did not contribute to the origianl discussion, but have this bit to add.
Many people like to appeal to "God's Will" as reason to oppose cloning.
You could note in your article that even if there is a god, it is no
longer in control.  Humans are reinventing themselves on their own terms,
and we don't need permission. 
People who can not reason in human terms are ill equiped to deal with
challenges such as cloning, and the breakthroughs that will follow.

I know, I never said it would be easy. In fact, it is probably one of

Yes, these root-causes probably reveal a lot about the parents. Shows
some of the basic assumptions of their respective world views ("final
causes").

And she will associate the stuff with her questions, so given the
above dialogue she would now associate eating healthy food ("cave
people food") and bacteria with evolution, which later will prove to
be generally correct. It is a bit like gradually tying together a web
of interconnections.

Hmm, in a text about creativity I found somewhere it suggested
following the why-chain for 5 steps in order to analyze a problem. 
The length may depend on how large mental leaps one makes between
each step, but I wonder if that is all there is to it. In some sense
it is a reverse 20-questions game where you tend to move towards
generality rather than specificity.

	We have none of that where we live.  Merchants take a two-hour lunch and
leave their outdoor displays and goods in place, unguarded.  The stores
leave such things as fertilizer, wood, potting soil outside, unguarded  at
all times.

	We committed the Moronic sin not once, not twice, but FIVE times!   Four
of the five have gone on to commit the Moronic sin a total of TEN times! 
When will the madness end?  When will the "I'M-IN-CLOSE-THE-DOOR" people be

	Our children all turned out to be independent thinkers and might be

Extros. (someone can take this up with the publicity department)  They were
not subjected to violence by spanking or hitting.  They were respected for
the individuals they were, and in turn they returned that respect. 
Non-Interference and self-responsibility was a daily way of life and the
babies grew up with those principles being experienced; which is a great
way to learn.  When we interfere with the life of our economy we only make
it worse.  What evidence do we have that we can interfere with the life of
our children, a much more complex event,  and make their lives better?

I was like this as a kid, so I was really looking forward to answering
such questions from my two boys (now ages 4 and 6).  Turns out they
haven't been interested.  Such are the risks of sexual reproduction. :-)

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

     Greetings all,
     
     As I've noticed one extropian aspiration is physical life extension 
     which I'm all for (actually quality of life over quantity of years 
     seems preferable but if we shaped up our act as a society, I might be 
     persuaded to stay on the planet longer <G>).  I've been recently taken 
     with the notion that it would be quite ironic that right about the 
     time we cinch the mortality issues and can extend physical human life 
     indefinitely through our technology, we will also have discovered a 
     spectrum of energy that could/will be defined as consciousness or, 
     more classically, the soul.  
     
     I've rather casually associated a metaphor of a laser with a 
     "self-aware discarnate entity".  The laser, being a concentrated beam 
     of photon energy, the uses of which continue to revolutionize our way 
     of life and our "self", also seemingly a concentration of thought and 
     potent awareness.  Though lasers they have been found to exist in 
     nature, our discovery and harnessing of them and how they work has 
     given us another tool in our ongoing discovery of "fire".  One step up 
     the ladder, monkey boys! (think Lithgow in Buckaroo Bonzai).  Perhaps 
     a discovery that self is not just an contrivance of our desperate 
     ego-based, and physically bound existence but more an instinctual 
     knowing that we have been and always will be (maybe it's something 
     that is a "Known" right down to the quantum level but that we can't 
     yet prove).
     
     I'm presently not very well read on the myths of all cultures but in 
     the Judeo-Christian motif out of which many people in Western Civ have 
     emerged, self-awareness is the first energy mentioned in Genesis, that 
     self-awareness being "God" (not compelling religious discussion here) 
     who then spoke (vibrated) light.  Archetypes, regardless of the 
     validity one might attach to them, are fascinating in how they take on 
     an iconic position in culture.  Could self-awareness, of what was 
     primitively regarded as Godhood be just around the corner in our 
     scientific understanding?  
     
     My latest reading project is "A Brief History of Everything" by Ken 
     Wilber and his theory of holarchy (every "thing" has the 
     characteristics of being a part and a whole) is quite fascinating.  
     I'm quite busy and I read slowly (it's because I'm a writer/editor I 
     imagine...can't quickly gulp up concept because the structure of words 
     is so preoccupying my thought process) so it'll be a while before I'm 
     done with the book but I wouldn't mind anyone who has read the book 
     piping up with some of their thoughts on it.

I must say that even here in New York City, life isn't too bad. The
continues to be run by socialists, but crime is not a particular day
to day worry (the murder rate is down to mid 1960s levels), work is
plentiful, and rent control may even end on June 15th if the
Republicans in the State Senate have the balls to go through with what
they've threatened -- if rent control goes away, housing prices will
likely drop and the city will probably experience a renaissance of
sorts.

In general, I'm optimistic. Unlike any other time in human history,
there is a low but good chance that we'll solve the aging problem
before I drop dead, and I'm signed up for cryonics just in
case. Business prospects for thinking people are better than ever
before, and money nearly litters the streets provided you have the
brains to pick it up.

The odds of global thermonuclear war are down (although the odds of
nuclear terrorism are up), and technology continues to develop
unabated, leading to interesting results for all of us within fifty
years or so.

All in all, a good time to be alive.

Synchronistically interesting: I just finished reading the online 
excerpts from physicist/author Fred Alan Wolf's 9611 book, _The 
Spiritual Universe: How Quantum Physics proves the Existence of the 
Soul_, which you can find at
http://www.hia.com/hia/fredwolf/su-home.htm

I found Wolf's notions appalling, to put it politely, but it's 
definitely along the lines you mentioned.

On Wed, 14 May 1997, Robin Hanson forwarded a message called "Caltech 
Astronomers Crack the Puzzle of Cosmic Gamma-Ray Bursts" which noted:
<Competing theories on gamma-ray bursts generally fall into two types: 
one, which supposes the bursts to originate from some as-yet unknown 
population of objects within our own Milky Way galaxy, and another, 
which proposes that the bursts originate in distant galaxies, several 
billion light-years away.>

The message added:
<The results demonstrate for the first time that *at least some* of 
the enigmatic gamma-ray bursts that have puzzled astronomers for 
decades are extragalactic in origin.>

Emphasis mine.  There seems to be a healthy competition of ideas in 
this area. For example, the following comes from a 3 May 97 Science 
News article called "Milky Way's Heart Gushes Antimatter " and can be 
found at
http://www.soundprint.org/sn_arc97/5_3_97/fob1.htm

<New observations suggest that the heart of our galaxy pumps a 
fountain of antimatter and hot gas into the tenuous halo of material 
lying several thousand light-years above it. The discovery could 
dramatically alter astronomers' view of the Milky Way and how the 
hotbed of activity at the galaxy's center influences its farthest 
extremities. The fountain "provides a conduit between the galactic 
center and distant parts of the galaxy," says gamma-ray astronomer 
Charles D. Dermer of the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in 
Washington, D.C. "This high-altitude feature . . . reveals how the 
core regulates the rest of the galaxy.">

Sounds to me like these gamma ray emissions may be just a normal part 
of galactic dynamics.

Since I am also expecting my first and only biological child, I am also very
interested in this question.  Newsweek has a special issue out now on child
development, which has an overview of a number of recent breakthroughs in the
study of infant brain development.  Things like, during a certain age period,
the brain wires itself for recognizing phonemes.  People who are raised in
households with different languages use different parts of their brains when
hearing the same phonemes.  The example I've seen is differences in brain
activity when hearing the "r" and "l" sounds, between english speakers and
Japanese speakers.  In the former, the brain lights up in a couple physically
distant spots, while in the latter it doesn't.

It's becoming clear that from 0 to 3, the brain gets wired in many different
ways, and this early wiring is both critical, and (so far as we know)
irreproducible.  Pretty damn amazing stuff, and the article is highly
recommended.  As the date approaches, I'll be searching out the primary sources.

I wonder what kind of Extropians memes will be presented at the 
"Global Knowledge 97" conference next month? 

See http://www.globalknowledge.org/.

The sponsors list is an interested "what's what..", but the "who's 
who..." seems to be a bit veiled behind the institutional identities.

See http://www.globalknowledge.org/graphics/sponsors.html.

May I suggest that a few enterprising Extropians create a 
distribution list containing the e-mail addresses of those 
individuals who represent the various institutions.

This is clearly an opportunity to inject some memes at a critical 
point in the "learning trajectories" of these organizations.

Yes indeed, as always.  Aside from the silly pseudo-theories, Wolf
promulgates the standard evil meme about science and objectivity:

`My physics knowledge is
both a gift and a curse in so far as it is needed to define the spiritual
universe and its agent, the soul.
The gift is that I see, objectively, how much of the physical universe
works. That perspective gives
me a certain peace of mind that the universe is not an accident and that
human life is meaningful and
purposeful. The curse is that when it comes to seeing essential matters of
the heart, subjectively, I
often see nothing. My scientific mind habitually takes over and I become
skeptical and unfeeling.'

When I read this kind of libel, my (lay person's) scientific mind
habitually takes over and I become skeptical and filled with passionate
intensity.

Aargh.  A brief correction to what I just posted to the list:

My Eudora mailer appears to have turned my cut&paste of Fred Alan Wolf's
prose drivel into a kind of faux verse, thus (assuming it arrives at other
people's mailers in little jagged lines):

Just thought I should mention that he *didn't* write it like that!

(Although people pushing such views often do seem attracted to
pseudo-poetry...)

That's perfectly timed as a lead in to this! --

Last year I completely rewrote and revised my original (1990) essay on
Dynamic Optimism (from Extropy #6). The new version, which identifies
twelve characteristics of dynamic optimists and suggests several
psychological principles for achieving dynamically optimistic thinking, I
had intended for a book. However, the book I'm now working on -- THE
AUGMENTED ANIMAL -- is something quite different. Rather than keep this
D.O. essay sitting on my hard drive feeling lonely I've added it to the ExI
web site.

You can find it either by going to the main page, then finding it in the
Ideas section, or by going directly to:

	http://www.extropy.org/do.htm

This new version should be accessible to a wider readership, since it was
written with that in mind. It's not so drily philosophical.

Subject: Lifespan extension and the existence of soul

     Greetings all,
     
     As I've noticed one extropian aspiration is physical life extension 
     which I'm all for (actually quality of life over quantity of years 
     seems preferable but if we shaped up our act as a society, I might be 
     persuaded to stay on the planet longer <G>).  I've been recently taken 
     with the notion that it would be quite ironic that right about the 
     time we cinch the mortality issues and can extend physical human life 
     indefinitely through our technology, we will also have discovered a 
     spectrum of energy that could/will be defined as consciousness or, 
     more classically, the soul.  
     
     I've rather casually associated a metaphor of a laser with a 
     "self-aware discarnate entity".  The laser, being a concentrated beam 
     of photon energy, the uses of which continue to revolutionize our way 
     of life and our "self", also seemingly a concentration of thought and 
     potent awareness.  Though lasers they have been found to exist in 
     nature, our discovery and harnessing of them and how they work has 
     given us another tool in our ongoing discovery of "fire".  One step up 
     the ladder, monkey boys! (think Lithgow in Buckaroo Bonzai).  Perhaps 
     a discovery that self is not just an contrivance of our desperate 
     ego-based, and physically bound existence but more an instinctual 
     knowing that we have been and always will be (maybe it's something 
     that is a "Known" right down to the quantum level but that we can't 
     yet prove).
     
     I'm presently not very well read on the myths of all cultures but in 
     the Judeo-Christian motif out of which many people in Western Civ have 
     emerged, self-awareness is the first energy mentioned in Genesis, that 
     self-awareness being "God" (not compelling religious discussion here) 
     who then spoke (vibrated) light.  Archetypes, regardless of the 
     validity one might attach to them, are fascinating in how they take on 
     an iconic position in culture.  Could self-awareness, of what was 
     primitively regarded as Godhood be just around the corner in our 
     scientific understanding?  
     
     My latest reading project is "A Brief History of Everything" by Ken 
     Wilber and his theory of holarchy (every "thing" has the 
     characteristics of being a part and a whole) is quite fascinating.  
     I'm quite busy and I read slowly (it's because I'm a writer/editor I 
     imagine...can't quickly gulp up concept because the structure of words 
     is so preoccupying my thought process) so it'll be a while before I'm 
     done with the book but I wouldn't mind anyone who has read the book 
     piping up with some of their thoughts on it.
     
     Regards,

I must say that even here in New York City, life isn't too bad. The
continues to be run by socialists, but crime is not a particular day
to day worry (the murder rate is down to mid 1960s levels), work is
plentiful, and rent control may even end on June 15th if the
Republicans in the State Senate have the balls to go through with what
they've threatened -- if rent control goes away, housing prices will
likely drop and the city will probably experience a renaissance of
sorts.

In general, I'm optimistic. Unlike any other time in human history,
there is a low but good chance that we'll solve the aging problem
before I drop dead, and I'm signed up for cryonics just in
case. Business prospects for thinking people are better than ever
before, and money nearly litters the streets provided you have the
brains to pick it up.

The odds of global thermonuclear war are down (although the odds of
nuclear terrorism are up), and technology continues to develop
unabated, leading to interesting results for all of us within fifty
years or so.

All in all, a good time to be alive.

will also have discovered a spectrum of energy that could/will be 
defined as consciousness or, more classically, the soul.>

Synchronistically interesting: I just finished reading the online 
excerpts from physicist/author Fred Alan Wolf's 9611 book, _The 
Spiritual Universe: How Quantum Physics proves the Existence of the 
Soul_, which you can find at
http://www.hia.com/hia/fredwolf/su-home.htm

I found Wolf's notions appalling, to put it politely, but it's 
definitely along the lines you mentioned.

Subject: Distant Gamma Ray Burster Nailed

On Wed, 14 May 1997, Robin Hanson forwarded a message called "Caltech 
Astronomers Crack the Puzzle of Cosmic Gamma-Ray Bursts" which noted:
<Competing theories on gamma-ray bursts generally fall into two types: 
one, which supposes the bursts to originate from some as-yet unknown 
population of objects within our own Milky Way galaxy, and another, 
which proposes that the bursts originate in distant galaxies, several 
billion light-years away.>

The message added:
<The results demonstrate for the first time that *at least some* of 
the enigmatic gamma-ray bursts that have puzzled astronomers for 
decades are extragalactic in origin.>

Emphasis mine.  There seems to be a healthy competition of ideas in 
this area. For example, the following comes from a 3 May 97 Science 
News article called "Milky Way's Heart Gushes Antimatter " and can be 
found at
http://www.soundprint.org/sn_arc97/5_3_97/fob1.htm

<New observations suggest that the heart of our galaxy pumps a 
fountain of antimatter and hot gas into the tenuous halo of material 
lying several thousand light-years above it. The discovery could 
dramatically alter astronomers' view of the Milky Way and how the 
hotbed of activity at the galaxy's center influences its farthest 
extremities. The fountain "provides a conduit between the galactic 
center and distant parts of the galaxy," says gamma-ray astronomer 
Charles D. Dermer of the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in 
Washington, D.C. "This high-altitude feature . . . reveals how the 
core regulates the rest of the galaxy.">

Sounds to me like these gamma ray emissions may be just a normal part 
of galactic dynamics.

Since I am also expecting my first and only biological child, I am also very
interested in this question.  Newsweek has a special issue out now on child
development, which has an overview of a number of recent breakthroughs in the
study of infant brain development.  Things like, during a certain age period,
the brain wires itself for recognizing phonemes.  People who are raised in
households with different languages use different parts of their brains when
hearing the same phonemes.  The example I've seen is differences in brain
activity when hearing the "r" and "l" sounds, between english speakers and
Japanese speakers.  In the former, the brain lights up in a couple physically
distant spots, while in the latter it doesn't.

It's becoming clear that from 0 to 3, the brain gets wired in many different
ways, and this early wiring is both critical, and (so far as we know)
irreproducible.  Pretty damn amazing stuff, and the article is highly
recommended.  As the date approaches, I'll be searching out the primary
sources.

I wonder what kind of Extropians memes will be presented at the 
"Global Knowledge 97" conference next month? 

See http://www.globalknowledge.org/.

The sponsors list is an interested "what's what..", but the "who's 
who..." seems to be a bit veiled behind the institutional identities.

See http://www.globalknowledge.org/graphics/sponsors.html.

May I suggest that a few enterprising Extropians create a 
distribution list containing the e-mail addresses of those 
individuals who represent the various institutions.

This is clearly an opportunity to inject some memes at a critical 
point in the "learning trajectories" of these organizations.

Yes indeed, as always.  Aside from the silly pseudo-theories, Wolf
promulgates the standard evil meme about science and objectivity:

`My physics knowledge is
both a gift and a curse in so far as it is needed to define the spiritual
universe and its agent, the soul.
The gift is that I see, objectively, how much of the physical universe
works. That perspective gives
me a certain peace of mind that the universe is not an accident and that
human life is meaningful and
purposeful. The curse is that when it comes to seeing essential matters of
the heart, subjectively, I
often see nothing. My scientific mind habitually takes over and I become
skeptical and unfeeling.'

When I read this kind of libel, my (lay person's) scientific mind
habitually takes over and I become skeptical and filled with passionate
intensity.

That's perfectly timed as a lead in to this! --

Last year I completely rewrote and revised my original (1990) essay on
Dynamic Optimism (from Extropy #6). The new version, which identifies
twelve characteristics of dynamic optimists and suggests several
psychological principles for achieving dynamically optimistic thinking, I
had intended for a book. However, the book I'm now working on -- THE
AUGMENTED ANIMAL -- is something quite different. Rather than keep this
D.O. essay sitting on my hard drive feeling lonely I've added it to the ExI
web site.

You can find it either by going to the main page, then finding it in the
Ideas section, or by going directly to:

	http://www.extropy.org/do.htm

This new version should be accessible to a wider readership, since it was
written with that in mind. It's not so drily philosophical.

         SEPANG, Malaysia, May 17 (Reuter) - Standing on a hill  
surrounded by rubber and oil palm plantations, Malaysian Prime 
Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Saturday launched what is being 
touted as the world's first planned intelligent city. 
         Using a ``smart card,'' Mahathir sent an instruction via  
computer to an object resembling a space probe on the hill which 
then drilled a hole in the ground, launching Cyberjaya 
(''cyber-success'' in Malay). 
         Aimed at luring top high-technology firms, the 7,000-hectare  
(17,300-acre) city will eventually support a population of 
240,000. Every home will have access to the Internet and all 
transactions will be done with smart cards. 
         The development, which Mahathir likes to call ``Cybercity,''  
is located in the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC), a zone 15 km 
by 50 km (nine miles by 30 miles) stretching south from Kuala 
Lumpur to where a new international airport and a new federal 
capital called Putrajaya are also under construction. 
         ``The establishment of the MSC, and Cyberjaya in particular,  
will enable Malaysians to leapfrog into the Information Age,'' 
Mahathir said in a speech at the ground-breaking. 
         He said it was the world's first effort at creating a  
planned living and working area for the information age. 
         It would be a place ``where knowledge workers and other  
residents may interact freely in a relaxed social environment, 
thereby creating an environment conducive to promoting 
creativity and innovation, similar to that which prevails in 
Silicon Valley in the United States,'' Mahathir said. 
         Some 40 foreign and local firms have made commitments to  
locate in Cyberjaya, including U.S. companies AT&T Corp, Intel 
Corp, Sun Microsystems Inc and NCR Corp, Germany's Siemens AG, 
British Telecommunications Plc and Japanese firms Mitsubishi 
Corp, Sumitomo and Sharp. 
         Mahathir described the response to the MSC as  
``overwhelming.'' The government expects 200 companies will 
eventually settle in the corridor, but Mahathir said that target 
would likely be exceeded. 
         A joint venture between five Malaysian parties and Japan's  
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) Corp will develop 
Cyberjaya. The initial investment is estimated at 3.5 billion 
ringgit ($1.4 billion). 
         The first phase of 2,800 hectares (6,900 acres) is to be  
completed by next April, including Multimedia University. 
         First conceived in 1994, the corridor hopes to attract a  
variety of firms -- from software designers and electronic 
publishers to film production houses and Internet service 
providers. 
         Some of the flagship applications include smart schools that  
incorporate the Internet and other computer applications as well 
as telemedicine. The latter enables doctors to communicate by 
satellite. 
         Its electronic backbone will be a 2.5-10 gigabyte digital  
fibre-optic network that will link the corridor to Japan, Europe 
and the United States. 
         The MSC will initially be driven by three mega-projects that  
will be major consumers of multimedia products and services. 
         One is the new capital of Putrajaya, designed to be the  
world's first paperless government hub. 
         The others are the new airport and the Kuala Lumpur City  
Centre, a massive office project featuring the Petronas Twin 
Towers, the world's tallest buildings at 452 metres (1,482 
feet). 
         ($1- 2.5 ringgit)

First there are the masers, microwave lasers that occurs in

whose atmosphere lase. See John Talbot's interesting page

or, Keeping Abreast of the ongoing Information Tsunami 

I am currently confronted with a common problem,
namely: how to manage one's mail. As soon similiar
trouble will probably plague other users, an ad
hoc analysis seems to be in order. Feel free to
dissect this to a bloody rag.

First, I am overwhelmed by sheer traffic volume.
Chronically infoglut infected (EPrime=me) tend to
homeostate their load up to the tolerance level
(and sometimes beyond), but the personal
infoprocessing resources _do_ fluctuate over
time. Should I become suddenly unable to access
my mail for several days (as happened recently
when my (notoriously unreliable, since academic)
ISP was down), processing the backlog can be
demanding, and scanning a month worth of mail is
beyond human (well, at least well beyond my current)
mental (fuzzy-brained) and bodily (chronically
bleary-eyed, carpal tunnel syndrome/RSI ridden
;) capabilities.

When in transit, accessing one's mail via
a cellular link and a laptop seems also a good
idea.

The most straightforward solution would be to be
able to cut off the bulk of the information stream,
but the most vital data by one invocation. The
simplest implementation for this would be to utilize
(at least) two email addresses, one for important,
low-traffic personal mail, and one for publicly
visible bulk traffic. Furthermore, a means to
(un)subscribe to one's mailing lists in one
step (or the reply-less equivalent of the
*NIX vacation program) seems to be useful.

(At least) 95% of everything is trash. So is
incoming mail. About 1-5% of everything I retain
for possible future reference. The simplest way to
reduce the percentile of trash (so I can subscribe
to even more mailing lists to max out on traffic)
is to block out certain posters (particularly certain
kooks, who generate many a wealth of redundant
posts) -- the classical killfile. I guess it is
not too difficult to implement a personalized
killfile filter via a perl script, which I intend
to do pretty soon, once the Linux box is done (btw
Linux, there is much ado hereabouts, as the (press)
mainstream has suddenly became aware of it). This
is also a first, albeit weak protection dam against
unsolicited mail, aka spam, since one might mark
certain domains for killfile targets with a single
(space-cadet) keystroke. I am not sure forged
mail headers are a good means for dealing with bot
scans, though I might be forced to accept this
easy solution, as absolute spam load has become
pretty intolerable on some days. I still think
that, apart from banishing mailto: tags from one's
web site (never came around to do this), this must
be handled by mailing list majordomo sofware,
which must substitute web-accessible archives
with local-visible-only mailing list users
handles, and which additionally limits access
to mailing lists by trivial (mail-back ack with a
one-time random token) or sophisticated (grant
of full membership by invoking majority decisions
of the inner circle, after a thorough scan of
applyers mail history) mechanisms.

Other thing plaguing me is inability to access
important, stored mail. Years worth of compressed,
'gene-filtered traffic lie around on several machines,
virtually inaccessible. A mail database, and full-text
index are a must, I guess. As I am determined to use
(x)emacs for a generic tool, and it can browse HTML,
I think using mSQL and w3-msql might be not a bad
choice. (I'd be thankful for pointers if anybody is
aware of a better PD dbase with a web interface).

Lacking truly smart filters (whatever happened to
Cyc?), we must still rely on human agents. I am
sure informal users groups forwarding user-prescanned
information are pretty common, what we need is to
formalize this approach. We must approve a panel
of high-selectivity web/usenet/mailing list
scanners, who feed their results into dedicated
channels. Thanks, Damien (cum shillelagh) for the
idea.

I volunteer for a scanner. Anybody else?

ciao,

        I've taken the liberty of removing this person's name from the list.
Does anyone know how people such as this get on to the extropian mailing list?
Perhaps it stems back from when David McFadzean had to reconstruct the member
database when the system broke down a couple months ago.  In any event, for
anyone who has a desire to leave this list it can be done so simply and
politely by either sending a message to extropians-request@extropy.com or by
going directly to the website itself.  This is all explained in the initial
introduction to the list that everybody receives upon signing up.  Hopefully
there won't be too much more discrepancy.

        It has been a little while since I've posted any poetry to the list;
this is partially due to my lack of writing, and partially due to the
not-initially-extropic content.  Though this one isn't totally extropic, it
demonstrates the neo-romantic naturalistic idea that humans and science are
a part of nature.



The Holiest Anthem


If nature was God, I'd be religious:
Weath'ring the taunts of subtle Perfection;
Faith would be limitless and prestigious,
Praising the sun's daily resurrection.

The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost
Would be the waters, the sun and the sky,
The world --my Bible, the libelous host
To which no commandments ever apply.

The universe? heaven without a hell--
A utopia there to be explored,
With nary an end anyone could tell
And no commander...not a King or Lord.

Forever be baptised in fields of grass,
Eternally set to travel abroad;
This is my blood in the prodigal glass--
The bread of my flesh, if nature was God.

	Just heard...playing Mozart is very good for improving mental abilities in
children.  Also provide them with a musical keyboard early so they can
develop their musical abilities.  If a child is not exposed to music early
the part of their brain which deals with music is not developed.  From
personal experience, we can concur.  We had no musical exposure and have
spent 20 years  developing an appreciation for music.  Our children and
grandchildren all were exposed to music early and play the piano well.  
Our six-year-old granddaughter just gave her first recital.  These kids
love to practice and do so without being reminded.

Hmm, critical developmental periods for music? Might be true. My
suggestion is to avoid playing just Mozart, and play a wide variety
of music styles so that the child can learn to understand them. I
have found that it takes some time to truly "get" music one is
unfamilliar with, and before that it is hard to perceive its beauty.

The same might go for other kinds of art. I grew up in an environment
almost devoid of poetry (lots of prose and music though), so I have
found that I have a harder time grokking poetry than many other
people. This might be the reason I like haiku and other minimalist
poems: less overhead in processing them, and a more direct effect.

My todo queue keeps growing longer and longer :(

I was actually less radical, trying to delegate the task of sifting and
sorting to an external artifical agency, which first learns by looking
over my shoulder, then gets progressively more autonomous. I'd like to
have a newsfeed continuously available, which requires a cell-linked
wearable, and a headup. Btw headup, TI now offers a MDM beamer kit, but
it's much too expensive yet (6k$, or so).

I think we _need_ periods of vita activa/contemplativa. Just maxing out
the load might blunt down you concepts/reduce overall processivity. I do
my best work when I deliberately isolate my self from the environment,
though I haven't tried out the proverbial cabin in the woods yet.

This is very good for work, when you need to make last-second changes to
the software when out in the field (I recently had a problem out at the
BMW research center, where there was no adequate IT infrastructure, it
would have taken 30 sec to fix, but so it required a trip through the
congested city), but I am thinking more towards an augmented reality,
rendered by a wearable. The Wintel cartel has not been contemplating 
these yet, though it is only a question of time. Another opportunity lost 
to big business :(

I have got a Newt 130, which looks like a prototype in relation to a Newt
2000 I've recently toyed with. The later lacks belt wearability, a colour
headup, and speech input still for a killer app. True wearables are at
least a decade off. Whoever has the resouces, should contemplate building
one. The MIT wearable group had some Linux-based wearables, which I
thought an overkill at the time, but a better machine would lack the
software basis Linux has.

The Rat Head (Red Hat) distribution seems to offer a good value for the
money, their installer and the Accelerated X considered. I will be
sticking with S.u.S.E. Linux for the next time, though.

Yes. I consider buying a scanner, and OCRing most of my multi-K treekiller
infobase into a digital medium, best accessible as a wearable. So far,
hard disks are not large enough. But soon....

I guess there is. Let's invent one, in a pinch.

Great. I was thinking about dividing several mailing lists/usenet
newsgroups around persons with similiar interests, who bounce messages
they consider interesting to a _small selection_ of mailing lists. E.g.
classes involing alternative energy, nanotechnology, cryonics, or whatever
other sorting bins a vote among scanners might result (an important point,
this). This feed going into web-accessible archives cum a full text
index/search engine, the whole shebang being later to be financed via
digicash by the subscriber. 
 
But initially, this to be run purely on a nonprofit basis. I guess we 
could achieve interesting results with just 2-5 scanner volunteers, 
probably using Extropy Institute's planned new infrastructure. Hence, I
am CCing this to the extropy list. Anyone more joining "A Scanner Darkly" 
throng?

Hi, everyone.  Brian Davis here.  I've been reading the digest for
months, but never got around to piping up.

I've been developing an interest in yestertech recently; steam engines,
air wells, flying wings, etcetera.  Specifically I'm looking for devices
that were supposed to be "the next big thing" but that never really
caught on.

I'm thinking of putting together some sort of museum exhibit celebrating
ignored and forgotten devices, schemes and plans.  

After all, in the 1990s people think that nanotechnology is the next big
thing.  But what ever happened to those undersea cities that people were
discussing constructing back in the 1950s?  How about countless other
futurological fads that never came about, but were so hot at the 1939
World's Fair?

And what about Scarecrow's brain?


If any extropians out there know of some resources I might tap, please
contact me.  I've been mining Kurt Saxon's books, and what I can find
from the aforementioned World's Fair, but I'm sure that I've just
scratched the surface of The Gernsbach Continuum

Well, they're not past "next big things", but the Atlantic has an amusing
paragraph each month on some bizarre expiring patent.

Bruce Sterling has been running an adjacent project for some time.  Thus:

---------------------------------------------------------
The DEAD MEDIA Project:  A Modest Proposal and a Public Appeal

by Bruce Sterling

	Ever notice how many books there are about the Internet these days?  
About 13,493 so far, right?  And how about "multimedia?"  There are 
8,784 books on this topic,  even though no one has ever successfully 
defined the term.  CD-ROM -- is there a single marketable topic left that 
hasn't been shovelwared into the vast digital mire that is CD-ROM?  And 
how about the "Information Superhighway" and "Virtual Reality"?  Every 
magazine on the planet has done awestruck vaporware cover stories on 
these two consensus-hallucinations.  

	Our culture is experiencing a profound radiation of new species of 
media.  The centralized, dinosaurian one-to-many media that roared and 
trampled through the 20th century are poorly adapted to the postmodern 
technological environment.  The new media environment is aswarm with 
lumbering toothy digital mammals.  It's all lynxes here, and gophers there, 
plus big fat venomous webcrawlers, appearing in Pleistocene profusion.  

	This is all well and good, and it's lovely that so many people are 
paying attention to this.  Nothing gives me greater pleasure as a 
professional garage futurist than to ponder some weird new mutant 
medium and wonder how this squawking little monster is going to wriggle 
its way into the interstices between human beings.  Still, there's a 
difference between this pleasurable contemplation of the technological 
sublime and an actual coherent understanding of the life and death of 
media.   We have no idea in hell what we are doing to ourselves with these 
new media technologies, and no consistent way even to discuss the 
subject.   Something constructive ought to be done about this situation. 

	I can't do much about it,  personally, because I'm booked up to the 
eyeballs until the end of the millennium.  So is my good friend Richard 
Kadrey, author of the COVERT CULTURE SOURCEBOOK.  Both Kadrey and 
myself, however, recently came to a joint understanding that what we'd 
really like to see at this cultural conjunction is an entirely new kind of 
book on media.  A media book of the dead.   

	Plenty of wild wired promises are already being made for all the 
infant media.  What we need is a somber, thoughtful, thorough, hype-free, 
even lugubrious book that honors the dead and resuscitates the spiritual 
ancestors of today's mediated frenzy.  A book to give its readership a 
deeper, paleontological perspective right in the dizzy midst of the digital 
revolution.  We need a book about the failures of media, the collapses of 
media, the supercessions of media, the strangulations of media, a book 
detailing all the freakish and hideous media mistakes that we should know 
enough now not to repeat, a book about media that have died on the barbed 
wire of technological advance, media that didn't make it, martyred media, 
dead media.  THE HANDBOOK OF DEAD MEDIA.  A naturalist's field guide for 
the communications paleontologist.

	Neither Richard Kadrey nor myself are currently in any position to 
write this proposed handbook.  However, we both feel that our culture 
truly requires this book:   this rich, witty, insightful, profusely 
illustrated, perfectbound, acid-free-paper coffee-table book, which is to 
be brought out, theoretically, eventually, by some really with-it, cutting-
edge early-21st century publisher.  The kind of book that will appear in 
seventeen different sections of your local chainstore:  Political Affairs, 
Postmodern Theory, Computer Science, Popular Mechanics, Design Studies, 
the coffeetable artbook section, the remainder table -- you know, 
whatever.   

	It's a rather rare phenomenon for an established medium to die.  If 
media make it past their Golden Vaporware stage, they usually expand 
wildly in their early days and then shrink back to some protective niche as 
they are challenged by later and more highly evolved competitors.  Radio 
didn't kill newspapers, TV didn't kill radio or movies, video and cable 
didn't kill broadcast network TV; they just all jostled around seeking a 
more perfect app.  

	But some media do, in fact, perish.  Such as:  the phenakistoscope.  
The teleharmonium.  The Edison wax cylinder.  The stereopticon.  The 
Panorama.  Early 20th century electric searchlight spectacles.  Morton 
Heilig's early virtual reality.  Telefon Hirmondo.  The various species of  
magic lantern.   The pneumatic transfer tubes that once riddled the 
underground of Chicago.  Was the Antikythera Device a medium?  How 
about the Big Character Poster Democracy Wall in Peking in the early 80s?  

	Never heard of any of these?  Well, that's the problem.   Both Kadrey 
and I happen to be vague aficionados of this field of study, and yet we both 
suspect that there must be hundreds of dead media, known to few if any.  
It would take the combined and formidable scholarly talents of, say, 
Carolyn "When Old Technologies Were New" Marvin and Ricky "Learned Pigs 
and Fireproof Women" Jay to do this ambitious project genuine justice.  
Though we haven't asked, we kinda suspect that these two distinguished 
scholars are even busier than me and Kadrey, who, after all, are just 
science fiction writers who spend most of our time watching Chinese 
videos, reading fanzines and making up weird crap.

	However.  We do have one, possibly crucial, advantage.  We have 
Internet access.  If we can somehow convince the current digital media 
community-at-large that DEAD MEDIA is a worthwhile project, we believe 
that we may be able to compile a useful public-access net archive on this 
subject.  We plan to begin with the DEAD MEDIA World Wide Web Page, on a 
site to-be-announced.  Move on, perhaps, to alt.dead.media.  Compile the 
Dead Media FAQ.  We hope to exploit the considerable strengths of today's 
cutting-edge media to create a general public-domain homage to the media 
pioneers of the past.

	Here's the deal.  Kadrey and I are going to start pooling our notes.  
We're gonna make those notes freely available to anybody on the Net.  If 
we can get enough net.parties to express interest and pitch in reports,  
stories, and documentation about dead media, we're willing to take on the 
hideous burdens of editing and system administration -- no small deal 
when it comes to this supposedly "free" information.   

	We both know that authors are supposed to jealously guard really 
swell ideas like this, but we strongly feel that that just ain't the way to 
do a project of this sort.  A project of this sort is a spiritual quest and
an 
act in the general community interest.  Our net heritage belongs to all 
netkind.  If you yourself want to exploit these notes to write the DEAD 
MEDIA HANDBOOK -- sure, it's our "idea," our "intellectual property," but 
hey, we're cyberpunks, we write for magazines like BOING BOING, we can't 
be bothered with that crap in this situation.  Write the book.  Use our 
notes and everybody's else's.  We won't sue you, we promise.  Do it.  Knock 
yourself out.   

	I'll go farther, ladies and gentlemen.  To prove the profound 
commercial potential of this tilt at the windmill, I'll personally offer a 
CRISP FIFTY-DOLLAR BILL for the first guy, gal, or combination thereof to 
write and publish THE DEAD MEDIA HANDBOOK.  You can even have the title 
if you want it.  Just keep in mind that me and Kadrey (or any combination 
thereof) reserve the right to do a book of our own on the same topic if you 
fail to sufficiently scratch our itch.   The prospect of "competition" 
frightens us not at all.  It never has, frankly.  If there's room for 19,785  
"Guide to the Internet" books, there has got to be room for a few useful 
tomes on dead media.

	Think of it this way.  How long will it be before the much-touted 
World Wide Web interface is itself a dead medium?  And what will become 
of all those billions of thoughts, words, images and expressions poured 
onto the Internet?  Won't they vanish just like the vile lacquered smoke 
from a burning pile of junked Victrolas?  As a net.person, doesn't this 
stark realization fill you with a certain deep misgiving, a peculiarly 
postmodern remorse, an almost Heian Japanese sense of the pathos of lost 
things?   If it doesn't, why doesn't it?  It ought to. 

	Speaking of dead media and mono no aware  -- what about those 
little poems that Lady Murasaki used to write and stick inside cleft 
sticks?  To be carried by foot-messager to the bamboo-shrouded estate of 
some lucky admirer after a night's erotic tryst?  That was a medium.  That 
medium was very alive once, a mainstay of one of the most artistically 
advanced cultures on earth.  And isn't it dead?   What are we doing today 
that is the functional equivalent of the cleft sticks of Murasaki Shikibu, 
the world's first novelist?  If we ignore her historical experience, how 
will we learn from our own?

	Listen to the following, all you digital hipsters.  This is Jaqueline 
Goddard speaking in January 1995.  Jacqueline was born in 1911, and she 
was one of the 20th century's great icons of bohemian femininity.  Man Ray 
photographed her in Paris in 1930, and if we can manage it without being 
sued by the Juliet Man Ray Trust, we're gonna put brother Man Ray's knock-
you-down-and-stomp-you-gorgeous image of Jacqueline up on our 
vaporware Website someday.    She may be the patron saint of this effort. 

	Jacqueline testifies:  "After a day of work, the artists wanted to get 
away from their studios, and get away from what they were creating.  
They all met in the cafes to argue about this and that, to discuss their 
work, politics and philosophy....  We went to the bar of La Coupole.  Bob, 
the barman, was a terrible nice chap...  As there was no telephone in those 
days everybody used him to leave messages.  At the Dome we also had a 
little place behind the door for messages.  The telephone was the death of 
Montparnasse."

	"*The telephone was the death of Montparnasse.*"  Mull that 
Surrealist testimony over a little while, all you cafe-society modemites.  
Jacqueline may not grok TCP/IP, but she has been there and done that.   I 
haven't stopped thinking about that remark since I first read it.   For whom 
does the telephone bell toll?  It tolls for me and thee -- sooner or later.  

	Can you help us?  We wish you would, and think you ought to.

Internetworking in the Navy -- R. Brian Adamson, Naval
Research Laboratory (Excerpted from "IPng Internet
Protocol Next Generation", Scott O. Bradner, Allison
Mankin, ed., Addision Wesley, 1996, pp. 27-35.).

The U.S. Navy and other armed services have identified
critical requirements for security, mobility, real-time
data-delivery applications, multicast, and
quality-of-service and policy-based routing of the next
generation of the Internet Protocol. Address scaling
for military application of internet technology may
include very large numbers of local (interplatform)
distributed information and weapons systems and a
smaller number of nodes requiring global connectivity.
The flexibility of the current Internet Protocol (IP)
for supporting widely different communication media
should be preserved to meed the needs of the highly
heterogenous networks of the tactical environment.

Compact protocol headers are necessary for efficient
data transfer on the relatively low throughput radio
frequency (RF) systems. Mechanisms which can enhance
the effectiveness of an internet datagram protocol
to provide resource reservation, priority, and
service quality guarantees are also very important.
The broadcast nature of many RF networks and the need
for broad dissemination of information to war-fighting
participants makes multicast the general case for
information flow in the tactical environment.

<b>Naval Research Efforts.</b> The requirements for
the Internet protocol next generation (IPng) candidates
with respect to their application to military tactical
RF communication networks need to be considered along
with private concerns. The foundatons for these
requirements are experiences born of the Navy's
research efforts in this area: the NATO Communication
System Network Interoperability (CSNI) project;
the Naval Research Laboratory Data/Voice Integration
Advanced Technology Demonstration (D/V ATD), and the
Navy Communication Support System (CSS) architecture
development.

<b>NATO Communication System Network Interoperability
Project.</b> The goal of the CSNI project is to apply
internetworking technology to facilitate multinational
interoperability for typical military communication
applications (e.g., electronic messaging, tactical data
exchange, and digital voice) on typical tactical RF
communication links and networks. The International
Standard Organization (ISO) Open Systems Interconnect
(OSI) protocol suite, including the Connectionless
Network Protocol (CLNP), was selected for this project
for policy reasons. There are design issues in meeting
the project goals with this particular protocol stack.

<b>Naval Research Laboratory's Data/Voice Integration
advanced Technology Demonstration.</b> The D/V ATD is
focused on demonstrating a survivable, self-configuring,
self-recovering RF subnetwork technology capable of
simultaneously supporting data delivery, including
message transfer, imagery, tactical data, and
real-time digital voice applications. Support for
real-time interactive communication application was
extended to include a "white board" and other similiar
applications. IP datagram delivery is also planned
as part of this demonstration system.

<b>Navy Communication Support System Architecture
Development.</b> The CSS architecture will provide
U.S. Navy tactical platforms with a broad array of
user-transparent voice and data information exchange
services. This will include support for sharing and
management of limited platform communicaiton resources
among multiple war-fighting communities. Emphasis is
placed on attaining interoperability of with other
military services and foreign allies. Utilization of
commercial off-the-shelf communication products to
take advantage of existing economies of scale is
important to make any resulting system design
affordable. It is anticipated that open, voluntary
standards, and flexible communication protocols, such
as IP, will play a key role in meeting the goals of
this architecture.

<b>IPng Requirements and RFC-1550.</b> Before
addressing and IPng requirements as applied to
tactical RF comminications, it is necessary to
define what is meant by "IPng requirements".
To maintain brevity, the criteria described in
this section are specifically related to the
design of an OSI model's Layer 3 protocol format
and a few other areas suggested by RFC-1550.
There are also several additional areas of
concern in applying intrenetwork protocols to
the military tactical RF setting:

    * routing protocol design
    * address assignment
    * network management
    * resource management

<i>Scale.</i> The requirement that IPng should be
able to deal with 10^12 nodes {{hah! never heard of
nanotechnology, apparently. why do we never learn?}}
is more than adequate in the face of military
requirements. More importantly, with IPng it must be
possible to assign adresses efficiently. For example,
although a military platform may have a relatively
small number of nodes with requirements to
communicate with a larger, global infrastructure,
there will be likely applications of IPng to
management and control of distributed systems
(e.g., specific radio communications equipement
and processors, weapon systems) within the platform.
This local expansion of address space requirements
may not necessarily need to be solved by "sheer numbers"
of globally unique addresses but perhaps by alternate
delimitations of addressing to differentiate between
globally unique and localy unique addressing. The
advantages of a compact internet address header
are clear for relatively low capacity RF networks.

<i>Transition.</i> The Navy and other armed
services are currently (in the past few years)
designing and deploying systems that use open
networking technology. From this point of view,
the time scale for selecting of IPng must be
somewhat rapid. Otherwise, two transition phases
will need to be suffered: 1) the move from unique
"stove pipe" systems to open, internetworked
(e.g.; IP) systems, and 2) a transition from
deployed IP-based systems to IPng. In some sense
if an IPng is quickly accepted and widely
implemented, the transition for tactical
military systems will be somewhat easier than
the enterprise Internet where a large investment
in current IP already exists. However, having
said this, the Department of Defense as a whole
already deploys a large number of IP-capable
systems, and the issue of transition from IP to
IPng remains significant.

<i>Media Independence.</i> The tactical communication
environment includes a very broad spectrum {{spread-spectrum?
;) }} of communication media from shipboard fiber-optic
LANs to very low data rate (fewer than 2400 bps) RF links.
Many of the RF links, evne higher speed ones, can exhibit
error statistics not necessarily well-serviced by higher
layre reliable protocols (i.e., TCP). In these cases,
efficient lower layer protocols can be implemented to
provide reliable datagram delivery at the link layer, but
at the cost of highly variable delay performance.

It is also important to recognize that RF communication
cannot be viewed from the IPng designer as simple
point-to-point links.

Often, highly complex, unique subnetwork protocols
are utilized to meet requirements of survivability,
communications performance with limited bandwith,
anti-jam, and/or low probability of detection
requirements.

It is understood that IPng cannot be the panacea of Layer 3
protocols, particularly when it comes to providing special
mechanisms to support the endangered-species low data rate
user. In some of these cases IPng will be one of several
Layer 3 protocols sharing the subnetwork. However, note
that there are potentially many low date rate, IP-based
applications of value to the tactical user. Well-designed,
efficient networking protocols, can allow many more users
to share the limited avialable RF bandwidth. A significant
fraction of data traffic in the tactical environment may
consist of short datagram messages (e.g., position reports,
fire control, etc.). Also, relatively low data rate links
will also likely utilize relatively small packet MTU sizes.
As a result, any mechanisms which facilitate compression
of network headers are highly valuable in an IPng candidate.

<i>Configuration, Administration, and Operation.</i> The
tactical military has very real requirements for multimedia
services across its shared and interconnected RF networks.
This includes applications from digital secure voice
integrated with applications such as "white boards" and
position reporting for mission planning purposes to low
latency, high priority tactical data messages (target
detection, identification, location, and heading information).
Because of the limited capacity of tactical RF networks,
resource reservation is extremely important to control
access to these valuable resources. Resource reservation
can play a role in "congestion avoidance" for these limited
resources as well as ensuring that quality-of-service (QoS)
data delivery requirements are met for multimedia communication.

Note that this requires more than can be met by simple QoS-
based path selection and subsequent source-routing to get
realtime-data, such as voice, delivered. For example, to
support digital voice in the CSNI project, a call setup and
resource reservation protocol was designed. It was determined
that the QoS mechanisms provided by CLNP specification were
not sufficient for our voice application with path selection.
Voice calls could not be routed adn resources reserved based
on any single QoS parameter (e.g., delay, capacity) alone.
Some RF subnets in the CSNI test bed simply did not have the
capability to support voice calls.

To perform resource reservation for the voice calls, the CLNP
cost metric was "hijacked" as essentially as a Type-of-Service
identifier to let the router know which datagrams were
associated with a voicecall. The cost metric, concatenated
with the source and destination addresses, were used to form
a unique identifier for voice calls in the router and subnet
state tables. Voice call paths were to be selected by the
router (i.e., the "cost" metric was calculated) as a rule-based
function of each subnet's capability to support voice, its delay,
and its capacity.

While source-routing provided as a possible means for voice
datagrams to find their way from router to router, the network
address alone was not explicit enough to direct the data to
correct interface {{why? broken design, this!}}, particularly
in cases where there were multiple communication media
interconnecting two routers along the path. Fortunately,
excluse use of the QoS indicator for voice in CSNI was able
to serve as a flag to the router for packets requiring
special handling.

<i>Flow specification.</i> While a simple Type-of-Service
field as part of an IPng protocol can serve this purpose where
there are a limited number of well-known services (CSNI has
a single special service: 2400 bps digital voice), a more
general technique such as RSVP's Flow Specification can
support a larger set of such services. And a field, such as
the one sometimes referred to as a Flow Identification (Flow ID),
can play an important role in facilitating internetworking
data communication over these limited capacity networks.

For example, the D/V ATD RF sub-network provides support
for both connectionless datagram delivery and virtual circuit
connectivity. To utilize this capacity, an IPng could establish
a virtual circuit connection across this RF subnetwork which
meets the requirements of an RSVP Flow Specification. By creating
an assotiation between a particular Flow ID and the subnetwork
header identifying the established virtual circuit, and IPng
gateway could forward data across the low-capacity link while
removing most, if not all, of the IPng header information.
The receiving gateway could re-construct these fields based on
the Flow Specification of the particular Flow ID/virtual circuit
association.

A field such as a Flow ID can serve at least two important
purposes:

    * It can be used by routers (or gateways) to identify
      packets with special, or pre-arranged delivery
      requirements. It is important to realize that it
      may not always be possible to "peek" at internet
      packet content for this information if certain
      security considerations are met (e.g., an encrypted
      transport layer).

    * It can air mapping datagram services to different
      types of communication services provided by special
      subnet/data link layers protocols.

<i>Secure Operation.</i> As with any military system,
information security, including confidentiality and
authenticity of data, is of paramount importance. With
regard to IPng, network layer security mechanisms for
tactical RF networks are generally important for
authentication purposes, including routing protocol
authentication, source authentication, and user network
access control. Concerns for denial of service attacks,
traffic analysis monitoring, etc., usually dictate that
tactical RF communication networks provide link layer
security mechanisms.

Compartmentalization and multiple levels of security
for different users of common communication resources
call for additional security mechanisms at the transport
layer or above. In the typical tactical RF environment,
network layer confidentiality, and in some cases even
authentication, becomes redundant with these other
security mechanisms.

The need for network layer security mechanisms becomes
more critical when the military utilizes commercial
communication systems or has tactical systems
interconnected with commercial internets. While the
Network Encryption Server (NES) works in this role
today, there is a desire for a more integrated, higher
performance solution in the future. Thus, to meet the
military requirements for confidentiality and
authentication, an IPng candidate must be capable at
operating in a secure manner when necessary, but also
allow for efficient operation on low throughput RF
links when other security mechanisms are already in
place.

In either of these cases, key management is extremely
important. Ideally, a common key management system
could be used to provide key distribution for security
mechanisms at any layer from the application to the
link layer. As a result, it is anticipated, however,
that key distribution is a function of management, and
should not be dependant on a particular IPng protocol
format.

<i>Multicast.</i> Tactical military communication has
a very clear requirement for multicast. Efficient
dissemiation of information to distributed war-fighting
participants can be the key to success in a battle.

In modren warfare, this information includes imagery,
the "tactical scene" via tactical data messages,
messaging information, and real-time interactive
applications such as digital secure voice. Many of
the tactical RF communication media are broadcast by
nature, and multicast routing can take advantage of
this topology to distribute critical data to a large
number of participants. The throughput limitations
imposed by these RF media and the physics of potential
electronic counter measures (ECM) dictate that this
information be distributed efficiently. A multicast
architecture is the general case for information flow
in a tactical network.

<i>Extensibility.</i> Quality of service and policy
based routing are of particular importance in a
tactical environment with limited communication
resources, limited bandwidth, and possible degradation
and/or denial of service. Priority is a very important
criteria in the tactical setting. In the tactical RF
world of limited resources (limited bandwidth, radio
assets, etc.) thre will be instances when there is not
sufficient capacity to provide all users with with
their perception of required communication capability.

It is extremely important for a shared, automated
communication system to to delegate capacity to higher
priority users. Unlike the commercial world, where
everyone has more equal footing, it is possible in
the military environment to assign priority to users
or even individual datagrams. An example of this is the
tactical data exchange. Tactical data messages are
generally single-datagram messages containing information
on the location, bearing, identification, etc., of
entities detected by sensors. In CSNI, tactical data
messages were assigned 15 different levels of CLNP
priority. This ensured that important messages, such
as a rapidly approaching enemy missile's trajectory,
were given priority over less important messages,
such as a friendly, slow-moving tanker's heading.

<i>Applicability.</i> There will be a significant
amount of applicability to tactical RF networks. The
current IP and CLNP are bing considerable attention
in the tactical RF community as a means to provide
communication interoperability across a large set of
heterogenous RF networks in use by different services
and countries. The applicability of IPng can only
improve with the inclusion of features critical to
supporting QoS and policy-based routing, security,
real-time multi-media data delivery, and extended
addressing. It must be noted that it is very important
that the IPng protocol headers not grow overly large.
There is a sharp tradeoff between the value added by
these headers (interoperability, global addressing,
etc.) and the degree of communication performance
attainable on limited capacity RF networks. Regardless
of the data rate that future RF networks will be capable
of supporting, there is always a tactical advantage in
utilizing your resources more efficiently.

<i>Support for Mobility</i> The definition of most
tactical systems include mobility in some form. Many
tactical RF network designs provide means for members
to join and leave particular RF subnets as their
position changes. For example, as a platform moves
out of RF line-of-sight (LOS) range, it may switch
from a typical LOS RF media such as the ultra-high
frequency (UHF) band to a long-haul RF media such as
high-frequency (HF) or satellite communications (SATCOM).

In some cases, as the D/V ATD network, the RF subnet
will perform its own routing and management of this
dynamic topology. This will be invisible to the internet
protocol except for subtle changes to some routing metrics
(e.g., more or less delay to reach a host). In this
instance, the RF subnetwork protocols serve as a buffer
to the internet routing protocols and IPng will not need
to be too concerned with mobility. In other cases, however,
the platform may make a dramatic change in position and
require a major change in internet routing. IPng must
be able to support this situation. It is recognized that
an internet protocol may not be able to cope with large,
rapid changes in topology. {{!!! why? broken protocol}}
Efforts will be made to minimize the frequency of this
in a tactical RF communication architecture, but there
are instances when a major change in topology is required.

Furthermore, it should be realized that mobility in the
tactical setting is not limited to individual nodes
moving about, but that, in some cases, entire subnetworks
may be moving. An example of this is a Navy ship with
multiple LANs on board, moving through the domains of
different RF networks. In some cases, the RF subnet will
be moving, as in the case of an aricraft strike force, or
Navy battlegroup.

<i>Datagram service.</i> The datagram service paradigm
provides many useful features for tactical communication
networks. The "memory" provided by datagram headers,
provides an inherent amount of survivability essential
to the dynamics of hte tactical communication environment.
The availability of platforms for routing and relaying is
never 100% certain in a tactical scenario. The efficiency
with which multicast can be implemented in a connectionless
network is highly critical in the tactical environment
where rapid, eficient information dissemination can be
a deciding factor. And, as it has been proven with several
different Internet applications and experiments, a
datagram service is capable of providing useful connection-
oriented and real-time connection services.

Consideration should be given in IPng to how it can co-exist
with other architectures usch as switching fabrics which
offer demand-based control over topology and connectivity.
The military owns many of its own communication resources
and one of the large problems in managing the military
communication infrastructure is directing those underlying
resources to where they are needed. Traditional management
(SNMP, tec.) is of course useful here, but RF communication
media can be somewhat dynamically allocated.

Circuit switching designs offer some advantages here.
Dial-up IP routing is an example of an integrated solution.
The IPng should be capable of supporti4g a similiar type of
operation.

Internetworking in the Navy -- R. Brian Adamson, Naval
Research Laboratory (Excerpted from "IPng Internet
Protocol Next Generation", Scott O. Bradner, Allison
Mankin, ed., Addision Wesley, 1996, pp. 27-35.).

The U.S. Navy and other armed services have identified
critical requirements for security, mobility, real-time
data-delivery applications, multicast, and
quality-of-service and policy-based routing of the next
generation of the Internet Protocol. Address scaling
for military application of internet technology may
include very large numbers of local (interplatform)
distributed information and weapons systems and a
smaller number of nodes requiring global connectivity.
The flexibility of the current Internet Protocol (IP)
for supporting widely different communication media
should be preserved to meed the needs of the highly
heterogenous networks of the tactical environment.

Compact protocol headers are necessary for efficient
data transfer on the relatively low throughput radio
frequency (RF) systems. Mechanisms which can enhance
the effectiveness of an internet datagram protocol
to provide resource reservation, priority, and
service quality guarantees are also very important.
The broadcast nature of many RF networks and the need
for broad dissemination of information to war-fighting
participants makes multicast the general case for
information flow in the tactical environment.

<b>Naval Research Efforts.</b> The requirements for
the Internet protocol next generation (IPng) candidates
with respect to their application to military tactical
RF communication networks need to be considered along
with private concerns. The foundatons for these
requirements are experiences born of the Navy's
research efforts in this area: the NATO Communication
System Network Interoperability (CSNI) project;
the Naval Research Laboratory Data/Voice Integration
Advanced Technology Demonstration (D/V ATD), and the
Navy Communication Support System (CSS) architecture
development.

<b>NATO Communication System Network Interoperability
Project.</b> The goal of the CSNI project is to apply
internetworking technology to facilitate multinational
interoperability for typical military communication
applications (e.g., electronic messaging, tactical data
exchange, and digital voice) on typical tactical RF
communication links and networks. The International
Standard Organization (ISO) Open Systems Interconnect
(OSI) protocol suite, including the Connectionless
Network Protocol (CLNP), was selected for this project
for policy reasons. There are design issues in meeting
the project goals with this particular protocol stack.

<b>Naval Research Laboratory's Data/Voice Integration
advanced Technology Demonstration.</b> The D/V ATD is
focused on demonstrating a survivable, self-configuring,
self-recovering RF subnetwork technology capable of
simultaneously supporting data delivery, including
message transfer, imagery, tactical data, and
real-time digital voice applications. Support for
real-time interactive communication application was
extended to include a "white board" and other similiar
applications. IP datagram delivery is also planned
as part of this demonstration system.

<b>Navy Communication Support System Architecture
Development.</b> The CSS architecture will provide
U.S. Navy tactical platforms with a broad array of
user-transparent voice and data information exchange
services. This will include support for sharing and
management of limited platform communicaiton resources
among multiple war-fighting communities. Emphasis is
placed on attaining interoperability of with other
military services and foreign allies. Utilization of
commercial off-the-shelf communication products to
take advantage of existing economies of scale is
important to make any resulting system design
affordable. It is anticipated that open, voluntary
standards, and flexible communication protocols, such
as IP, will play a key role in meeting the goals of
this architecture.

<b>IPng Requirements and RFC-1550.</b> Before
addressing and IPng requirements as applied to
tactical RF comminications, it is necessary to
define what is meant by "IPng requirements".
To maintain brevity, the criteria described in
this section are specifically related to the
design of an OSI model's Layer 3 protocol format
and a few other areas suggested by RFC-1550.
There are also several additional areas of
concern in applying intrenetwork protocols to
the military tactical RF setting:

    * routing protocol design
    * address assignment
    * network management
    * resource management

<i>Scale.</i> The requirement that IPng should be
able to deal with 10^12 nodes {{hah! never heard of
nanotechnology, apparently. why do we never learn?}}
is more than adequate in the face of military
requirements. More importantly, with IPng it must be
possible to assign adresses efficiently. For example,
although a military platform may have a relatively
small number of nodes with requirements to
communicate with a larger, global infrastructure,
there will be likely applications of IPng to
management and control of distributed systems
(e.g., specific radio communications equipement
and processors, weapon systems) within the platform.
This local expansion of address space requirements
may not necessarily need to be solved by "sheer numbers"
of globally unique addresses but perhaps by alternate
delimitations of addressing to differentiate between
globally unique and localy unique addressing. The
advantages of a compact internet address header
are clear for relatively low capacity RF networks.

<i>Transition.</i> The Navy and other armed
services are currently (in the past few years)
designing and deploying systems that use open
networking technology. From this point of view,
the time scale for selecting of IPng must be
somewhat rapid. Otherwise, two transition phases
will need to be suffered: 1) the move from unique
"stove pipe" systems to open, internetworked
(e.g.; IP) systems, and 2) a transition from

military systems will be somewhat easier than
the enterprise Internet where a large investment
in current IP already exists. However, having
said this, the Department of Defense as a whole
already deploys a large number of IP-capable
systems, and the issue of transition from IP to
IPng remains significant.

position changes. For example, as a platform moves
out of RF line-of-sight (LOS) range, it may switch
from a typical LOS RF media such as the ultra-high
frequency (UHF) band to a long-haul RF media such as
high-frequency (HF) or satellite communications (SATCOM).

In some cases, as the D/V ATD network, the RF subnet
will perform its own routing and management of this
dynamic topology. This will be invisible to the internet
protocol except for subtle changes to some routing metrics
(e.g., more or less delay to reach a host). In this
instance, the RF subnetwork protocols serve as a buffer
to the internet routing protocols and IPng will not need
to be too concerned with mobility. In other cases, however,
the platform may make a dramatic change in position and
require a major change in internet routing. IPng must
be able to support this situation. It is recognized that
an internet protocol may not be able to cope with large,
rapid changes in topology. {{!!! why? broken protocol}}
Efforts will be made to minimize the frequency of this
in a tactical RF communication architecture, but there
are instances when a major change in topology is required.

Furthermore, it should be realized that mobility in the
tactical setting is not limited to individual nodes
moving about, but that, in some cases, entire subnetworks
may be moving. An example of this is a Navy ship with
multiple LANs on board, moving through the domains of
different RF networks. In some cases, the RF subnet will
be moving, as in the case of an aricraft strike force, or
Navy battlegroup.

<i>Datagram service.</i> The datagram service paradigm
provides many useful features for tactical communication
networks. The "memory" provided by datagram headers,
provides an inherent amount of survivability essential
to the dynamics of hte tactical communication environment.
The availability of platforms for routing and relaying is
never 100% certain in a tactical scenario. The efficiency
with which multicast can be implemented in a connectionless
network is highly critical in the tactical environment
where rapid, eficient information dissemination can be
a deciding factor. And, as it has been proven with several
different Internet applications and experiments, a
datagram service is capable of providing useful connection-
oriented and real-time connection services.

Consideration should be given in IPng to how it can co-exist
with other architectures usch as switching fabrics which
offer demand-based control over topology and connectivity.
The military owns many of its own communication resources
and one of the large problems in managing the military
communication infrastructure is directing those underlying
resources to where they are needed. Traditional management
(SNMP, tec.) is of course useful here, but RF communication
media can be somewhat dynamically allocated.

Circuit switching designs offer some advantages here.
Dial-up IP routing is an example of an integrated solution.
The IPng should be capable of supporti4g a similiar type of
operation.

A good place to start is possibly contacting Popular Science about
developing an archive of their new tech stuff. They have a monthly page
of what they had in the mag 25, 50, 100, 150 years ago. It is frequently
rather entertaining.

Subject: You are now subscribed to the HTECH-L list

Sun, 12 Jan 1997 10:16:11

Your subscription  to the HTECH-L  list (History of Technology  Discussion) has
been accepted.

Please  save this  message  for future  reference, especially  if  you are  not
familiar with LISTSERV. This might look like  a waste of disk space now, but in
6 months you will be glad you  saved this information when you realize that you
cannot  remember what  are the  lists you  are subscribed  to, or  what is  the
command to  leave the list to  avoid filling up  your mailbox while you  are on
vacations.  In fact,  you  should create  a new  mail  folder for  subscription
confirmation messages  like this one, and  for the "welcome messages"  from the
list owners that  you are will occasionally receive after  subscribing to a new
list.

To send a message to all the people currently subscribed to the list, just send
mail to HTECH-L@SIVM.SI.EDU. This is called "sending mail to the list", because
you send mail to a single address  and LISTSERV makes copies for all the people
who  have subscribed.  This address  (HTECH-L@SIVM.SI.EDU) is  also called  the
"list address". You must  never try to send any command to  that address, as it
would be distributed  to all the people who have  subscribed. All commands must
be    sent    to    the   "LISTSERV    address",    LISTSERV@SIVM.BITNET    (or
LISTSERV@SIVM.SI.EDU).  It  is  very  important to  understand  the  difference
between the two, but fortunately it is not complicated. The LISTSERV address is
like a  FAX number, and the  list address is like  a normal phone line.  If you
make your  FAX call someone's  regular phone number by  mistake, it will  be an
unpleasant experience for him but you  will probably be excused the first time.
If you  do it regularly,  however, he  will probably get  upset and send  you a
nasty complaint.  It is the same  with mailing lists, with  the difference that
you are calling hundreds or thousands of people at the same time, so a lot more
people get annoyed if you use the wrong number.

You may leave  the list at any  time by sending a "SIGNOFF  HTECH-L" command to
LISTSERV@SIVM.BITNET (or LISTSERV@SIVM.SI.EDU). You  can also tell LISTSERV how
you want it to confirm the receipt of  messages you send to the list. If you do
not trust the system, send a "SET HTECH-L REPRO" command and LISTSERV will send
you a  copy of  your own messages,  so that  you can see  that the  message was
distributed and did not get damaged on the way. After a while you may find that
this is  getting annoying, especially  if your mail  program does not  tell you
that the message is from you when it informs you that new mail has arrived from
HTECH-L. If  you send a "SET  HTECH-L ACK NOREPRO" command,  LISTSERV will mail
you a short acknowledgement instead, which  will look different in your mailbox
directory. With  most mail programs you  will know immediately that  this is an
acknowledgement you can read later.  Finally, you can turn off acknowledgements
completely with "SET HTECH-L NOACK NOREPRO".

Following instructions from the list owner, your subscription options have been
set  to "REPRO  NOFILES"  rather than  the usual  LISTSERV  defaults. For  more
information  about subscription  options,  send a  "QUERY  HTECH-L" command  to
LISTSERV@SIVM.BITNET (or LISTSERV@SIVM.SI.EDU).

Contributions sent to this list are  automatically archived. You can get a list
of  the available  archive  files  by sending  an  "INDEX  HTECH-L" command  to
LISTSERV@SIVM.BITNET (or LISTSERV@SIVM.SI.EDU). You  can then order these files
with  a "GET  HTECH-L LOGxxxx"  command,  or using  LISTSERV's database  search
facilities. Send an "INFO DATABASE" command for more information on the latter.

Please note  that it is presently  possible for other people  to determine that
you are signed  up to the list  through the use of the  "REVIEW" command, which
returns the e-mail address and name of  all the subscribers. If you do not want
your name to be visible, just issue a "SET HTECH-L CONCEAL" command.

More information  on LISTSERV commands can  be found in the  LISTSERV reference
card,  which  you  can  retrieve  by  sending  an  "INFO  REFCARD"  command  to
LISTSERV@SIVM.BITNET (or LISTSERV@SIVM.SI.EDU).

Use of IPng in Combat Simulation

(excerpted from "IPng Internet Protocol Next Generation",
 Scott O. Bradner, Allison Mankin (ed.), Addison Wesley,
 1996, pp. 95-100).

The Defense Modeling and Simulation (M&S) community is
a major user of packet networks and as such has a stake
in the definition of IPng. We will summarize the Distributed
Interactive Simulation environment that is under development,
with regards to its real-time nature, scope, and magnitude
of networking requirements. The requirements for real-time
response, multicast, and resource reservation are set forth,
based on on our best current understanding of the future of
Defense Modeling and Simulation.

<b>Introduction.</b> The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
is now in the process of designing the Internet Protocol next
generation (IPng). IPng is expected to be a driving force in
the future of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) networking
technology. It will have a major impact on what future
networking technologies are widely available, cost-effective,
and multi-vendor interoperable. Applications that have all
of their network layer requirements met by the standard
features of IPng will be at a great advantage, whereas those
that don't will have to rely on protocols that are not as
widely available and more costly, that may have limited
interoperability with the ubiquitous IPng-based COTS products.

We will specify the network layer requirements of Defense M&S
applications. It is important that the M&S community make its
unique requirements clear to IPng designers so that mechanisms
for meeting these requirements can be considered as standard
features for IPng. The intention is to make IPng's benefits
have wide COTS availability, multivendor interoperability,
and cost-effectiveness, all fully available to the M&S
community.

<b>Overview of Distributed Interactive Simulation.</b> The
Defense M&S community requires an integrated, wide area,
wideband internetwork to perform Distributed Interactive
Simulation (DIS) {{ain't that the capital of Hell?}}
excercises among remote, dissimiliar simulation devices
located at worldwide sites. The network topology used
in current M&S excercises is typically that of a
high-speed cross-country adn trans-oceanic backbone
running between wideband packet switches, with tail
circuits running these packet switches to various nearby
sites. At any given site involved in an excercise, there
may be several internetworked local area networks on
which numerous simulation entity hots are running. Some
of these hosts may be executing computer-generated
semi-automated forces, while others may be manned
simulators. The entire system must accomodate delays
and delay variance compatible with human interaction
times in order to preserve an accurate order of events
and provide a realistic combat simulation. {{Notice
that here no attempt is being made to cope with fully
automatically initiated events well below the human
agent reaction time scale}}. While the sites themselves
may be geographically distant from one another, the
simulation entities running at different sites may
themselves be operating and interacting as though
they are in close proximity to one another in the
battlefield. Our goal is that all of this can take
place in a common network that supports all Defense
M&S needs, and hopefully is also shared with other
Defense applications.

In a typical DIS excercise, distributed simulators
exchange information over an internetwork in the form
of standardtized packets. The DIS protocols and packet
formats are currently under development. The first
generation has been standartized as IEEE 1278.1 and
used for small exercises (around 100 hosts), and
development of a second generation is underway. The
current Communications Architecture for DIS specifies
use of Internet protocols.

The amount, type, and sensitivity of information that
must be exchanged during a typical DIS exercise drives
the communication requirements for that exercise, and
depends on on the number and type of participating
entities and the nature and level of interaction among
those entities. Future DIS exercises now in planning
{{MAO:HTN--, eh?}} extend to hundreds of sites and
tens of thousands of simulation platforms worldwide.
For example, an exercise may consist of semi-automated
and individual manned tank, aircraft, and surface
ship simulators interacting on predefined geographic
terrain. The actual locations of these simulation
entities may be distributed amond sites in Virginia,
Kansas, Massachussetts, Germany, and Korea. The packets
that are exchanged among simulation entities running
at these sites must carry all of the information
necessary to inform each site regarding everything
relevant that occurs with regard to all other sites that
have the potential to affect it within the simulation
{{a light cone thing}}. Such information could include
the location of each entity, its direction and speed,
the orientation of its weapon systems, if any, the
frequency of on which it is transmitting and receiving
radio messages. If an entity launches a weapon, such
as a missile, a new entity representing this missile
will be created within the simulation and it will
begin transmitting packets containing relevant
information about its state, such as its location, and
speed.

A typical moving entity will generate between one and
two packets per second, with typical packet sizes of
220 Bytes and a maximum size of 1400 Bytes, although
rates 15 packets/second and higher are possible.
Stationary entities must generate some traffic to
refresh receiving simulators; under the current
standard this can be as little as 0.2 packets per
second. Compression techniques reducing packets size
by 50% or more are being investigated but are not
included in the current DIS standard {{methinks they
should be investigate quake}}.

With so much information being exchanged among
simulation entities at numerous locations, multicasting
is required to to minimize network bandwidth used and
to reduce input to individual simulation entities so
that each entity receives only those packets that
are of interest to it. For example, a given entity
need only receive information regarding the location,
speed, and direction of other entities that are close
enough to it within the geography of the simulation
that it could be affected by those entities.
Similiarly, an entity needs need not receive packets
containing the contents of radio transmissions that
are sent on a frequency other that on which this
entity is listening.

Resource reservation mechanisms are also essential to
guarantee performance requirements of DIS exercises:
reliability and real-time transmission are necessary
to accomodate the manned simulators {{yet}} participating
in an exercise.

M&S exercises that include humans in the loop and
are executed in real-time require rapid network response
times in order to provide realistic combat simulations.
For DIS, latency requirements between the ouput of a
packet at the application level of the simulator and
input of that packet at the application level of any
other simulator in that exercise have been defined as:

    * 100 ms for exercises containing simulated units
      whose interactions are tightly coupled

    * 300 ms for exercises whose interactions are not
      tightly coupled [17]

The reliability of best-effort datagram delivery service
supporting DIS should be such that 98% of all datagrams are
delivered to all intended destination sites, with missing
datagrams randomly distributed. [18]

While these number may be refined for some classes of
simulation data in the future, latency requirements are
expected to remain under a few hundred milliseconds in
all cases. It is also required that delay variance (jitter)
be low enough that smoothing by buffering the data stream
at the recieving simulator des not cause the stated latency
specifications to be exceeded.

There are currently several architectures under considerations
for the M&S network of the future. Under fully distributed
models, all simulation entities rely directly on the network
protocols for multicasting and are therefore endowed with much
flexibility with regard to their ability to join and leave
multicast groups dynamically, in large numbers.

In some cases, the M&S exercises will involve the transmission
of classified data over the network. For example, messages
may contain sensitive data regarding warfare tactics and
weapons system characteristics, or an exercise itself may be
a rehearsal of an imminent military operation. This means the
data communications used for these exercises must meet
security constraints defined by the National Security Agency
(NSA) {{No Such Agency}}. Such such requirements can be met in
current systems by use of end-to-end packet encryption (E3)
systems. E3 systems provide adequate protection from disclosure
and tampering, while allowing multiple security partitions
to use the same network simultaneously.

Currently the M&S community is using the experimental Internet
Stream protocol version 2 (ST2) to provide resource reservation
and multicast. There is much interest in converting to IPv4
multicast as it becomes available across the COTS base, but this
cannot happen until IPv45 has a resource reservation capability.
The RSVP work ongoing in the IETF is being watched in expectation
that it will provide such a capability. Also some tests have
been made of IPv4 multicast without resource reservation;
results have been positive, now larger tests are required to
confirm the expected scalability of IPv4 multicast. But issues
remain, for security reasons, some M&S exercises will require
sender-intiated joining of members of multicast groups. In
addition, it is not clear that IPv4 multicast will be able to
make use of link-layer multicast available in ATM systems,
which the M&S community expects to use to achieve the performance
necessary for large exercises.

<b>Specific Requirements.</b> It is recognized that some
of the capabilities described below may be provided not
from IPng but form companion protocols, e.g. RSVP [19]
and IGMP. The M&S requirement is for a compatible suite
of protocols that are available in commercial products.

<i>Real-time Response.</i>  DIS will continue to have
requirements to communicate real-time data, therefore
the extent to which IPng lends itself to implementing
real-time networks will be a measure of its utility for
M&S networking.

<i>Multicasting.</i> M&S requires a multicasting capability
and a capability for managing multicast group membership.
These multicasting capabilities must meet the following
requirements:

    * Scalable to hundreds of sites and, potentially, to
      tens of thousands of simulation platforms.

    * It is highly desirable that the network-layer
      multicasting protocol be able to use the multicasting
      capabilities of link-level technologies, such as
      broadcast LANs, Frame Relay, and ATM. (By highly
      desirable, we mean that the capabilities are not
      essential, but they will enable more direct and
      cost-effective networking solutions).

    * The group management mechanics must have the
      characteristics that thousands of multicast groups
      consisting of tens of thousands of members each can
      be supported on a given network and that a host should
      be able to to belong to hundreds of multicast groups
      simulataneously.

    * Multicast group members must be able to be added to
      or to removed from groups dynamically, in less than
      one second {{notice the timescale}}. It is not possible
      to predict what special cases may develop, thus this
      requirement is for all the members of all groups.

    * The network layer must support options for both sender-
      and receiever-initiated joining of multicast groups.

<i>Resource Reservation</i> The M&S community requires performance
guarantees in supporting networks. This implies that IPng must
be compatible with a capability to reserve bandwidth and other
necessary allocations in a multicast environment, in order to
guarantee network capacity from simulator-to-simulator across a
shared network for the duration of the user's interaction with
the network. Such a resource reservation capability is esential
to optimizing the use of limited network resources, increasing
reliabilit, and decreasing delay and delay variance of priority
traffic, especialy in cases in which network resources are
heavily used. The resource reservations should be accomplished
in such a way that traffic without performance guarantees will
be re-routed, dropped, or blocked before reserved bandwidth
traffic is affected.

In addition, it would be highly desirable for the resource
reservation capaibility to provide mechanisms for:

    * invoking additional network resources (on-demand
      capacity) when needed.

    * The network to feed back its loading status to the
      applications to enable graceful degradation of performance.

development of a second generation is underway. The
current Communications Architecture for DIS specifies
use of Internet protocols.

The amount, type, and sensitivity of information that
must be exchanged during a typical DIS exercise drives
the communication requirements for that exercise, and
depends on on the number and type of participating
entities and the nature and level of interaction among
those entities. Future DIS exercises now in planning
{{MAO:HTN--, eh?}} extend to hundreds of sites and
tens of thousands of simulation platforms worldwide.
For example, an exercise may consist of semi-automated
and individual manned tank, aircraft, and surface
ship simulators interacting on predefined geographic
terrain. The actual locations of these simulation
entities may be distributed amond sites in Virginia,
Kansas, Massachussetts, Germany, and Korea. The packets
that are exchanged among simulation entities running
at these sites must carry all of the information
necessary to inform each site regarding everything
relevant that occurs with regard to all other sites that
have the potential to affect it within the simulation
{{a light cone thing}}. Such information could include
the location of each entity, its direction and speed,
the orientation of its weapon systems, if any, the
frequency of on which it is transmitting and receiving
radio messages. If an entity launches a weapon, such
as a missile, a new entity representing this missile
will be created within the simulation and it will
begin transmitting packets containing relevant
information about its state, such as its location, and
speed.

A typical moving entity will generate between one and
two packets per second, with typical packet sizes of
220 Bytes and a maximum size of 1400 Bytes, although
rates 15 packets/second and higher are possible.
Stationary entities must generate some traffic to
refresh receiving simulators; under the current
standard this can be as little as 0.2 packets per
second. Compression techniques reducing packets size
by 50% or more are being investigated but are not
included in the current DIS standard {{methinks they
should be investigate quake}}.

With so much information being exchanged among
simulation entities at numerous locations, multicasting
is required to to minimize network bandwidth used and
to reduce input to individual simulation entities so
that each entity receives only those packets that
are of interest to it. For example, a given entity
need only receive information regarding the location,
speed, and direction of other entities that are close
enough to it within the geography of the simulation
that it could be affected by those entities.
Similiarly, an entity needs need not receive packets
containing the contents of radio transmissions that
are sent on a frequency other that on which this
entity is listening.

Resource reservation mechanisms are also essential to
guarantee performance requirements of DIS exercises:
reliability and real-time transmission are necessary
to accomodate the manned simulators {{yet}} participating
in an exercise.

M&S exercises that include humans in the loop and
are executed in real-time require rapid network response
times in order to provide realistic combat simulations.
For DIS, latency requirements between the ouput of a
packet at the application level of the simulator and
input of that packet at the application level of any
other simulator in that exercise have been defined as:

    * 100 ms for exercises containing simulated units
      whose interactions are tightly coupled

    * 300 ms for exercises whose interactions are not
      tightly coupled [17]

The reliability of best-effort datagram delivery service
supporting DIS should be such that 98% of all datagrams are
delivered to all intended destination sites, with missing
datagrams randomly distributed. [18]

While these number may be refined for some classes of
simulation data in the future, latency requirements are
expected to remain under a few hundred milliseconds in
all cases. It is also required that delay variance (jitter)
be low enough that smoothing by buffering the data stream
at the recieving simulator des not cause the stated latency
specifications to be exceeded.

There are currently several architectures under considerations
for the M&S network of the future. Under fully distributed
models, all simulation entities rely directly on the network
protocols for multicasting and are therefore endowed with much
flexibility with regard to their ability to join and leave
multicast groups dynamically, in large numbers.

In some cases, the M&S exercises will involve the transmission
of classified data over the network. For example, messages
may contain sensitive data regarding warfare tactics and
weapons system characteristics, or an exercise itself may be
a rehearsal of an imminent military operation. This means the
data communications used for these exercises must meet
security constraints defined by the National Security Agency
(NSA) {{No Such Agency}}. Such such requirements can be met in
current systems by use of end-to-end packet encryption (E3)
systems. E3 systems provide adequate protection from disclosure
and tampering, while allowing multiple security partitions
to use the same network simultaneously.

Currently the M&S community is using the experimental Internet
Stream protocol version 2 (ST2) to provide resource reservation
and multicast. There is much interest in converting to IPv4
multicast as it becomes available across the COTS base, but this
cannot happen until IPv45 has a resource reservation capability.
The RSVP work ongoing in the IETF is being watched in expectation
that it will provide such a capability. Also some tests have
been made of IPv4 multicast without resource reservation;
results have been positive, now larger tests are required to
confirm the expected scalability of IPv4 multicast. But issues
remain, for security reasons, some M&S exercises will require
sender-intiated joining of members of multicast groups. In
addition, it is not clear that IPv4 multicast will be able to
make use of link-layer multicast available in ATM systems,
which the M&S community expects to use to achieve the performance
necessary for large exercises.

<b>Specific Requirements.</b> It is recognized that some
of the capabilities described below may be provided not
from IPng but form companion protocols, e.g. RSVP [19]
and IGMP. The M&S requirement is for a compatible suite
of protocols that are available in commercial products.

<i>Real-time Response.</i>  DIS will continue to have
requirements to communicate real-time data, therefore
the extent to which IPng lends itself to implementing
real-time networks will be a measure of its utility for
M&S networking.

<i>Multicasting.</i> M&S requires a multicasting capability
and a capability for managing multicast group membership.
These multicasting capabilities must meet the following
requirements:

    * Scalable to hundreds of sites and, potentially, to
      tens of thousands of simulation platforms.

    * It is highly desirable that the network-layer
      multicasting protocol be able to use the multicasting
      capabilities of link-level technologies, such as
      broadcast LANs, Frame Relay, and ATM. (By highly
      desirable, we mean that the capabilities are not
      essential, but they will enable more direct and
      cost-effective networking solutions).

    * The group management mechanics must have the
      characteristics that thousands of multicast groups
      consisting of tens of thousands of members each can
      be supported on a given network and that a host should
      be able to to belong to hundreds of multicast groups
      simulataneously.

    * Multicast group members must be able to be added to
      or to removed from groups dynamically, in less than
      one second {{notice the timescale}}. It is not possible
      to predict what special cases may develop, thus this
      requirement is for all the members of all groups.

    * The network layer must support options for both sender-
      and receiever-initiated joining of multicast groups.

<i>Resource Reservation</i> The M&S community requires performance
guarantees in supporting networks. This implies that IPng must
be compatible with a capability to reserve bandwidth and other
necessary allocations in a multicast environment, in order to
guarantee network capacity from simulator-to-simulator across a
shared network for the duration of the user's interaction with
the network. Such a resource reservation capability is esential
to optimizing the use of limited network resources, increasing
reliabilit, and decreasing delay and delay variance of priority
traffic, especialy in cases in which network resources are
heavily used. The resource reservations should be accomplished
in such a way that traffic without performance guarantees will
be re-routed, dropped, or blocked before reserved bandwidth
traffic is affected.

In addition, it would be highly desirable for the resource
reservation capaibility to provide mechanisms for:

    * invoking additional network resources (on-demand
      capacity) when needed.

    * The network to feed back its loading status to the
      applications to enable graceful degradation of performance.

As the admin for a number of mailing lists, I've found myself the target
of flame mail from a growing number of irate people who have been subscribed

main impetus for the last Majordomo upgrade was a new feature that prevents

	We agree.  Our musical library is considered VERY eclectic.  The
information we received, though brief, reported increased results on tests
when children studied with Mozart, or listened to Mozart prior to taking
tests.  Which indicates the importance of music in that area.  We have
experienced other effects of different styles of music, and have found them
useful for various reasons.  Here in Switzerland, Music Therapy is
recognized as useful for a variety of problems, including various learning
disabilities.  As an "L.D." (learning disabled or late developer) we are
perhaps more sensitive to such discoveries.  We are also more sensitive to
our own mental development. 
	If children are exposed to all styles of music, they will benefit from
whatever each style has to offer.  They cannot help but be enriched by the
experience.
	On another note....(we bet we get away with this....changing topics in the
middle of the missive...) we loved the essay Max wrote about EDO.  It was
very near a program we presented to a mystical convention and it was
received with overwhelming concurance.  As we have pointed out before, the
mystics we have been in contact with are very pro-individual
responsibility, encourage questioning all that you have been "programmed"
with by government agents or religious agents, operate on the meme that one
must know oneself before they can hope to be their own master, one must
make decisions when one is not operating in an emotional state, one needs
to realize that abundance is available to all, it is simply a matter of
focusing ones attention and action to the goal, etc.  The point being, we
have noted a bigoted attitude towards myticism on this list and we
understand it.  We also know that there are many "mystics" which are full
of shit and are playing their particular game for the bucks....which is a
pretty good yardstick for sincerity.  But, the vast majority of mystics we
have encountered have so many of the traits of Extropians that they would
make you blush...if that was possible.  Perhaps what we are getting at is
there are more people leaning towards Extro thinking than most Extros know
about.  Perhaps it is because there is an attitude amongst some Extros,
much like religious-freaks, that one must believe in the whole package or
be rejected as a heretic.  Many people embrace parts of the Extro view and
could embrace more, if they were invited in a non-threatening way.
Certainly they are open to discussion, we have found.

Looks like you're close.

According to the Spring/Summer '97 special issue of Newsweek magazine 
which was recommended in an earlier message by Ray Peck (thanks, Ray, for 
the tip - this is a great introduction to the latest theories of how kids 
from 0 to 3 learn about the world around them!):

"In a study published in February in the journal Neurological Research, 
scientists report how spatial-temporal reasoning in 3- and 4-year-olds 
was affected by weekly piano lessons.  After six months, the budding 
Horowitzes - all of whom scored at the national average on tests of 
spatial recognition - scored 34 percent above average on this reasoning 
skill.  None of the other children (who had received computer keyboard 
and mouse lessons, singing lessons or nothing at all) had improved.  What 
explains the effect?  Physicist Gordon Shaw of the University of 
California, Irvine, suspects that in playing the piano, "you are seeing 
tho patterns work in space and time."  When sequential finger and key 
patterns make melodies, neural circuits that connect positions (keys) to 
sounds in space and time (the melody) are strengthened.  "Music training 
produces long-term modifications in neural circuitry," says Shaw.  What 
scientists do not know is whether the effects of early music training 
endure - whether the preschoolers will be math wizards in high school."

(Personal note - I studied the violin for 5 years and definitely did not 
turn out to be a math whiz.  Although at least some of that was probably 
because I didn't do a very good job of making myself do the homework...  
As an aside, I find at times that I wish I could still play.)

Do you consider yourself an expert on investing? Have you thought about
which investment strategies might make good sense given the technological
changes we expect to see over the coming decades? If not yourself, can you
suggest someone you consider expert on investing from an extropian angle?

If so, I'd like to hear from you.

Well, they seem to happen on the average once every million years per
galaxy, so they are hardly uncommon.  But they are not galaxy-sized effects,
like the antimatter fountain.  Since they vary over time scales as short as
a millisecond, they can't be bigger than a light-millisecond across, i.e.
3000 km.  I just did a back of the envelope calculation (well, in my head,
actually) and determined that to get all the gamma rays from a burst into a
volume that small, they would have to be compressed to the density of lead.
Cool, huh?

  True to my name handle, I'd like to alert y'all to the truly

  companies, the former a non-profit effort to continuously

      s t o r e  ALL OF (unrestricted-access) WWW pages FOREVER ;

  the second a commercial outfit developing tools to browse and
  reuse such cumulative/ multi-generation archive contents. 

  Acc. to their owner Brewster Kahle --formerly of the Thinking
  Machines Corp., and a father of WAIS-- one of the target functions
  of Alexa-derived software is to be a `"reliability service" that
  will resurrect dead links.  Give the URL and an approximate date
  to the Archive, and it will dig up the document.'.....  rings a
  bell, doesn't it?

  The Alexa archives are made of successive sweep-n-suck (BIIIG 
  sucks, too) sessions of the entire WWW dataspace resulting in 
  consecutive "frozen Webs" stored at one location -- currently
  a warehouse in SF; ultimately in the digital storage facility of 
  the US National Archives in Washington, D.C.  Treating an entire
  docuverse as a collection of "barts" (or "stamps", I keep mixing
  them up) may sound like a bit of overkill, but whoever said that
  the (yellow brick) road to Xanadu must be straight and narrow?

!!!!!????? Gamma at the density of lead? Now this is so wildly ridiculous,
it fails even to send a shiver down my spine. 

Which processes can be _that_ energetic? Even if we assume colliding
neutron stars, travelling at their usual kinetical + gravitational
potential energy, and assume a high conversion efficiency (several 
10%) to gamma, intuitively this doesn't suffice. I don't have
Carl's envelopes at the house, could anyone give some ballpark figures
on energetics of such events?

If a hole eats a pulsar in one fell gulp, how much energy is released
then? And why does my every darn sentence seem to end with a question
mark, today? 

Since we are at the holes, and evaporating primeval singularties should
give a fair gamma flash (how fast? did somebody record the GBR spectral
changes)? before winking out, can one look out of them? (But these should
be very rapid, and extremely faint, being observable just in low lightyear
range).

Hi.

Since people on this list occasionally inquire about various aspects of
investing on the stock market (esp. tech stocks), I would like know if
anyone on this list would be interested in starting some type of investment
club.

Investment is essential for financial security and is accessible even to
people of meager financial means.  Since, many extropians are planning on
living indefinitely, it would be prudent to start planning your very
long-term finances now.  Intelligent investments usually result in being
independently wealthy when applied for ~40 years, even if the investments
appear small.

If there is enough interest, I would be willing to donate my experience
with investing as well as my access to investment information resources to
help out those of you with less experience than I.  And if there are other
experienced investors out there, I would hope that they would be willing to
share their knowledge as well.

Additionally, I would be willing to operate a website and other Internet
services dedicated to this.  I am half-owner of a couple modest servers and
some redundant T-1 connections, so it would cost me nothing other than my
time.


If anyone is interested in becoming involved in something like this, please
let me know.

What do you mean by "extropian angle"?  

Investing is a complex issue and strategies vary widely depending on your
goals.  The most common goals are capital growth, tax sheltering, income,
and inflation hedging.

The technological changes have far less impact on the overall economy than
in their own sectors.  The sum total of all the "high-tech" and supporting
industries account for 4% of the GNP in the US, and even less in other
countries.  Consumer industries have a far greater impact on growth than
technology industries.  

The most profound economic impacts are usually caused by demographic
shifts, most of which can be predicted ahead of time with careful study.
The unprecedented 1995-96 American stock market surge was predicted by the
research divisions of several large investment firms a decade or two prior
to its actual occurrence.  That surge can attributed almost exclusively to
a large demographic shift.  Incidentally, another important demographic
shift is expected to occur ~5 years from now, but with negative impact on
the US market.

Technology stocks ( what I personally specialize in ) are a special case of
investment strategies, since the "normal" rules of industrial age investing
need to be somewhat modified to work properly in the information age.  A
lot of people lose money investing in the technology arena because they try
to apply the principles they use on the old school NYSE stocks to the
volatile and uncertain NASDAQ market.  It is difficult to make the fabulous
wealth associated with tech stocks unless you are (1) very knowledgeable
about the technologies you are investing in, or (2) very lucky.  Since I
don't believe in luck, I always depend on the former.  Also, there are
dozens of fad technologies that attract a lot of attention, but are flashes
in the pan and unlikely to generate profits for the investor.  In my
experience, most stock analysts have a very difficult time determining the
difference between tech-fad and tech-value.  Silicon Valley is littered
with the carcasses of highly-funded, highly-touted companies.

The specifics of a strategy for investing in technology would depend on
your end goals.

	Thanks for the memory jog.  It was Mr. Shaw in an interview on an American

 Yes, day trading (nano-second trading?) is interesting to me.
I suggest using the fastest computer with the fastest connection 
to be able to react to the market before anyone else.
Tech can make this kind of investing into a race.
This process can be fully, hands off, computerized; 
the idea already begins to bore me.

 Knowing what will happen before it happens is also nice.
The futures exchange can make you millions quick 
if you have global weather forcasts for the past 200 years on record.
Many seasonal predictions can be made with 90% accuracy.
Those odds are alot better than blackjack!

 I say futures is the way to go.
Learn the future and make money too.
I think learning what the future holds is fun.
It gives me time to prepare for what will soon be in the present;
I can put my self in a position of control and wait for the earnings to
pour in, 
instead of mearly reacting to what the present shoves in my face.
Having been a boy scout, I love to prepare, 
sometimes more than doing what I prepare for.

 One investment idea I was toying with 
was considering plate tectonics' effect on real estate.
If you invest in the long term, don't invest in India.
That is, of course, unless you want your property subducting under the
Asian plate 
and pushing up the Himalayas.

 I wanted to build a cryo-tomb 
at the site that would remain on the surface of the Earth the longest.
What is a better place for a monument to immortality?
I haven't yet figured out where that would be though.
A good map is hard to find.
I tried looking for someone at NASA that could help me,
but they have so much cool stuff I got distracted and forgot about it.
Hopefully I won't be on this planet much longer
and there won't be a need for a cryo-tomb anyway.

 Can anybody point me towards Alpha Centauri?

 20% compounded annually for ETERNITY sounds good to me!
How about you?
If we play smart (the only way to play) we can get 2000% gains.
It may take solid dedication and determination, 
but it has been done before and will be done again.
Who better to do it?

 I would, at least, like to be kept informed of how this meme evolves.
I've been wanting to become a broker, 
but I've yet to fit the pieces of this puzzle together.
I want to see this idea get off the ground.
Being rich is very extropian.

I thought the grounds of extropian belief where an open-mind and the fact
that beliefs aren't forced upon you.  Extro thinking (to me) seems to be
basic, a platform for which to build your own personal concepts of yourself
and the world around you.  Surely anyone with the attitude that you speak of
is not extropic at all!

For those not familiar with it, _Forbes ASAP_ is a spinoff of _Forbes_ 
magazine that tracks information technology trends for corporate 
executives.  Their 9612 "Big Issue" is available online
http://www.forbes.com/asap/120296/the_big_issue.htm
and spares no expense in gathering articles from big-name 
commentators.

The "History and Politics: FLYING FAST ON MEMORIES AND INSTRUMENTS 
ALONE" section features articles from Mark Helprin and Newt Gingrich 
to Ralph Nader and Jeremy Rifkin.

The "Private Life: FINDING OUR CYBER WAY HOME" section features 
articles from Esther Dyson and Michael Kinsley to Al Goldstein and 
Camille Paglia.

The "Science and Technology: STUMBLING TOWARD A FINAL THEORY" section 
features articles from Bill Gates and Andy Groves to Nicholas 
Negroponte and Steven Weinberg.

The "Public Life: ...AND SPEAK OF THE DEATH OF INSTITUTIONS" section 
features articles from Tom Wolfe ("Sorry, But Your Soul Just Died") 
and Peter Huber ("The End of Law and the Beginning") to Tom Peters and 
Michael Hammer.

Finally, there is George Guilder's "Last Words: What Civilization 
Can't Afford to Forget" where he derides "a new generation of 
Nietzschean neuroscientists intoxicated with the notion that they have 
mastered the mind".

You might find it entertaining.

     Good day to all,
     
     With a recent thread about what to invest in and how "from an 
     extropian angle", this begs the question in my mind: Do extropians 
     support or indulge the current market economy motif?  I keep 
     speculating about how some of the new up and coming industries (such 
     as nanotech) might turn the current economic structure inside out.
     
     Not to be too "Jetsons" but as the aforementioned multi-billion 
     dollar-funded industry jumps the hurdles it now faces (nano-scale 
     physics I believe to be a major area of R&D), we could have material 
     goods assembling themselves for cheap and manufacturing (like word 
     processing, desktop publishing and studio recording of the last decade 
     or two) become something done on a personal scale in our homes.  Some 
     of the XPARC brains envision replicating machines like microwave ovens 
     or dishwashers now, using carbon-based feedstock in a water-heater 
     type container as the building block.  Outlandish?  Any more so than 
     how the common citizen of the previous century regarded (if they even 
     considered) telecommunications, supersonic flight, laser surgery and 
     the like.  And our advancements (when not bogged down by trifling 
     concerns of how to outwit competitors and return the largest profit on 
     a huge investment) increase much more rapidly as we approach the end 
     of this decade/century/millennium.
     
     Biotech is another area where great advancements are being made but 
     will it become as belabored and full of misplaced priorities and 
     controversy as the pharmaceutical industry?  As long as we are 
     cow-towing to the money machine, acting like modern Phoenicians, 
     clutching our coins, assigning them meaningful value, equating them 
     with survival and success, lying, cheating, stealing and killing for 
     them, implicitly and blatantly, how far can we go in the extropian 
     sense and how swiftly can we expect to get there?
     
     Must we embrace the notion that people in this culture only do 
     something when something is in it for them?  And the "it" is the 
     material-bound "stuff" that our culture is completely awash in.  Do 
     all the gadgets and distractions of the super warehouse stores and 
     mega malls promote cultural/racial harmony, reduce crime, improve 
     minds, get us individually involved, change paradigms, innovate beyond 
     our dreams?  Or do we just continue to want and hoard?  Do we finally 
     get "enough" of the things we want (an ever expanding list thanks to 
     the likes of multi-nationals like Sony, Nike, et.al.) and go off in 
     our corner and contentedly play (that is, after we've activated our 
     home security system to keep out those who would take our toys)?  
     
     People seem to be numbed and immobilized by their possessions.  One 
     has to wonder, do we (speaking of all of us not just extropian-minded 
     people) just merrily follow the status quo?  Do extropians try to 
     wedge their vision into the current socio-economic structure?
     
     True, right now, it takes money to do the things, make the changes we 
     envision.  I am not advocating forsaking material wealth and gain.  I 
     am advocating that the goal of the post-human would be to restructure 
     the current order, not only for self improvement but for the 
     improvement of all.  Libertarianism (still not sure how that is 
     regarded in the extropian realm), as ideal and utopian as it is 
     sometimes painted, could end up being just as noxious, just as futile 
     as the material-bound capitalist and communist run systems in the last 
     few centuries.  If "investment", meaning capital investment, has the 
     result of serving the needs of the many as well as the one, I regard 
     that as a good thing.  Self-serving indulgence doesn't seem like a 
     post-human endeavor.  If it does, let me know now for I'm here to 
     examine whether or not this a group with a creed I can genuinely 
     subscribe to.  A post-human, in my estimation, not only pushes the 
     envelopes of the technological, physiological and social structure but 
     also the structure of self and of ego.  These are components that 
     should not be neglected in the evolutionary process.  
     
     Ego is useful but so is gasoline.  It has to be treated with respect, 
     used in the right way, carried in the right container, developed in a 
     way that limits/eliminates its cumulative toxicity to the environment. 
     The metaphor can be easily applied to our seemingly innate tendencies 
     to exploit, conquer, usurp and ignore.  Should post-humanism be 
     considered complete without including the evolution of emotions.  
     
     One thing I've noticed occasionally turn up in these threads (and 
     something that the initial rules disclaimer seeks to limit) is an 
     opinionated pomposity, a precursor to name-calling and certainly a 
     suppressive element to pro-active and constructive exchange of ideas.  
     I am compelled to ask those so motivated to diminish and deride the 
     ideas and opinions of others what their fundamental goal is.  In this 
     message, as soapboxy as it may occur for some, I've posed the ideas 
     not as altruisms but as questions to be considered.  My participation 
     in this is to be a component in improving, recognizing the partness 
     and wholeness of everything.  I hope to check ego at the door so as to 
     provide the most potency for the exchanges here.  My aim is not to 
     provoke or alienate but stimulate and intrigue.  My goal is 
     possibility beyond the known, perhaps beyond the dream.  Please 
     consider that thoughtfully if you are compelled to reply.

A few of us in So Cal have been meeting to discuss investments. I am very
interested in helping the development and communication of investment
wisdom among Extropians. You know the expression: "If you're so smart, how
come you're not rich?" We should all have a compelling answer... "Just take
a look at my portfolio, buddy!"

The Investing in the Future panel at EXTRO 3 would be a good way of finding
out who is interested in an investment club. A brief response form could be
distributed at the session and results published in the Exponent newsletter.

     Hi again,
     
     In my previous e-mail today, I meant to attach a quote that I got from 
     a guy by the name of Michael Ventura who used to (may still) write for 
     LA Weekly.  The quote was to underscore my feeling about how overt 
     materialism preoccupies (at best) or sedates/immobilizes (at worst) 
     our citizenry.
     
     "This is the death of the Republic: When the people clamor to be 
     shielded from reality, when they praise their government for keeping 
     things from them, when they choose to conduct their lives within the 
     limits of whatever fantasy the government supplies, then they are no 
     longer consenting to be governed, they are begging to be ruled."
     
     Don't know if there are any "magic pills" out there to be the 
     stimulant needed to shake off more of the complacency that dulls the 
     senses of many in this culture but I'm hopeful that benevolent 
     thinkers and feelers, perhaps within the ranks of Extropians, will 
     emerge that will rally our resources together not only to take 
     responsibility but to act zealously to improve our communities and 
     restore our environment.
     
     Regards,
     
     Rick

	I think about how I could best help others.  The way I will help others is
through my work (I'm looking into robotics).  Of course, helping others is
secondary.  I am most interested in the benefits to myself through the
paycheck, the enjoyment of the work, and the advancement of my personal
posthumanity, which happens to coincide with everybody else's.
	I could help people by forcing others to give money but that has too many
problems.  First there is the cost of force, then there is the loss of
initiative (from the forced and the beneficiary).  In all, it does not
cause the evolution of humanity.
	The best way to help people is to help yourself.  If your goals are high
enough, their will be spillover of benefits to the rest of the population. 
For instance, if I invest in life extension I can receive the benefits of
wealth and the benefits of increased life span.  Others benefit from the
increased life span as well (provided they want it enough to pay for it).
	I could be a humanitarian and work in a third world country helping people
but, besides the fact that I do not want to, I do not think it is the best
way to help people.     
	As for ego, in posthumanity the self will be those who are in constant
communication.  If I know all your thoughts and you know all my thoughts
then we are the same being.  Individuality will be somewhat different then
it is now.

This email discusses Managing mail and the Godsend of ADD and short
attention spans. It features at least one shameless plug for the
authors works but includes free tips on mail managing techniques.

DO NOT DELETE ....IT _may_ BE IMPORTANT (or a waste of your time)  :)
=====================================================================
(the _REAL_ info comes in the last paragraph!!!)

MikeRose writes:

This problem reminds me of a CNN report on 'information overload', it
detailed how we are all going to suffer stress in the future because of
excess info from phone, videophone, fax, pagers, email, the internet, tv,
radio and whatever the tech geeks decide to invent next.

At the time I laughed. I had just finished "Playing the Future", an
excellent work by Douglas Rushkoff (of "Cyberia" fame) and I had just met
him in Toronto and discussed the same 'problem'.

Basically there is no problem. There is a lot of data and info, sure, but
you can still only use what you are capable of using.

Don't moan about having too much - we are so lucky to be living in an age
(nee country, cf. China) where such info is freely available - instead of
whinging why not take a course in speed reading or look into 'intelligent
agent' based email programs that will filter out the crap that you do not
want, "Make Money Fast", "Have You Heard This One", "UnSubscribe ME!"
etc.

Speed reading and scanning techniques are excellent and you will find that
the younger generation, our kids, already seem to have these
'chaos-surviving' strategies 'built-in'.

What looks like a short attention span to a parent, or attention
deficiency disorder (ADD) to a child psychologist, is usually a child with
a broader attention 'range'.

My grandfather was subject to (and therefore could only cope with) maybe 5
new realities/ideas a day (newspapers and books). My parents maybe 10-20
(early television and radio). Me, I cannot comprehend the number I get
thrown at me from mass advertising, cable television, radio, computer
games, the internet etc. etc. etc.

The average child can cope with 100 times more information than my 
grandfather ever could. My grandpop needed information in a linear
single medium form, a book perhaps. Whereas when the Heaven's Gate cult
news broke I was simultaneously watching CNN, reading the papers, flicking
to NBC, then ABC, then to the internet, newsgroups and email. 

Sure, I lost some of the finer points and some of the minute details but I
got a far greater range of opinion, news and comment. Most of the
info I missed was the crap that I was intended to swallow hole,
mainly adverts, agendas and the comment from the 'objective' news
anchors.

Boredom and anxiety are the two signs to look out for.... anxiety sells
products and agendas... bordom signals that you are not really learning
anything and that you are slowly slipping into a more programable
agenda-susceptable couch-potato-trance mode.

Such techniques are also more propaganda proof as no one dominant spin can
dominate my knowledge - I make my own spin to suit my own needs.

This all may be irrelevant to the original post and boring to you
personally, if it is then I hope you deleted it a long time ago.

If you are still reading then you are either interested in this topic and
would be interested in my article on 'Screenagers - surving in the age of
info-overload' or you are very bad at disregarding the info that you do
not need.

Take up speed reading or at least learn to 'cut the crap' quicker. Channel
surfing isn't bad - it shows your childrens brains are still alive and
active and not being mashed into a pulp by inane shows and mind-melting
advertisments.

> (At least) 95% of everything is trash.

You were refering specificaly to email, as if you were expecting the
medium to be so much cleaner than TV or the papers. You are right 95% of
_*EVERYTHING*_ is crap. 95% of what your read/see/hear/believe is crap.

Why should your email box be any better than the 80 channels you may, or
may not, have piped into your home? I'm sure your regular mailbox gets 
more bills and junk mail than REAL "quality" mail.


MY POLICY: If you care
----------------------

My policy is to scan my mailbox, which is sorted according to subject, and
_immediatly_ tag for deletion anything which isn't _immediatly_
recognisable as interesting, or anything not _instantly_ recognisable as
coming from a trusted and reliable 'contact'.

It is obviously that you will lose some vital and interesting information
this way. But you cannot watch two good TV programmes at once (even a VCR
means you will miss 1 out of three programmes) and the time saved
outweighs the potential loses. You just have to trust you instincts.

This method also provides a long time bonus. It will force writers who
wish to be noticed to write clearly/concisely etc. etc. The subject lines
will eventually become more pertinant and descriptive and the first
paragraph, like a news story, will start to be written in a way which will
grab the readers attention. Luckily I am studying communications theory
and journalism and know many techniques of hypnotising my readers. This
email is a bad example but I do urge you to read the aformentioned
article.

After rapid deletion on immediatly crap looking crap I go back to
what is left and read/reply etc, leaving my best friends (longest mails)
till last. If I still have time (which is rare) I then go back to the
mails I wanted to delete.

At the end of each session (approx. 1 hour) I usually delete around 200
mails. Often I get hooked on one or two new threads and usually get bored
of one-two. Once a thread is deemed to be 'going nowhere' it is easy to
delete them ALL because they are clumped together (sorted by subject).

I think email filters are good... but better is to develop a personal
strategy, that way you stretch your limits and learn to cope with the
expanding horizons before you. After a while you'll be surprised at how
much more information you can digest.


just a few thoughts..... I hope I didn't waste anyone's time. I was going
to delete Eugene's mail but I had some time on my hands and found the bait
far too tempting.

~Trust Your Instincts~

I would be very interested, since I was looking to invest in

This was all covered years ago in Drexlers "Nanosystems" as well as
the "Nanopunk" novel "The Diamond Age" By Neal Stephanson.

Sounds like a good replacement for _Wired_.

I checked it out--the writing's pretty good, and the libertarian
ideology ought to appeal to many list members, especially the Tom
Wolfe article on Neuroscience.  (I'm personally not that far down
the libertarian road, but different strokes, etc.)

     Dan,
     
     Thanks for your feedback.  From an extropian p.o.v, I agree that 
     robotics has beneficial ramifications to a broad spectrum of our 
     society, provided our current work ethic evolves along with the 
     technology.  Ask any blue collar worker whose livelihood has been 
     usurped by technology, they'd likely have a different (albeit 
     knee-jerk) view.  
     
     I'd need more convincing about your statement "The best way to help 
     people is to help yourself."  Sounds kinda like the Republicans in the 
     80s with their trickle-down economics.  It's also like the glass is 
     half-empty, half-full concept.  It may be a very complex path from the 
     results of your efforts to the benefit they perceive (and they may not 
     be well-informed enough to even perceive it).  Therefore, the concept 
     seems to require an installation of "faith" to power it.  OTOH, you 
     can't help/love others until you help/love yourself.  I agree with 
     that conceptually.  It's just in our culture, the "pure concept" 
     becomes an entangled mess of complex exceptions and exclusions when 
     filtered through the bureaucracy, the propriety and materialistic 
     mindset.  
     
     Bottom line: you can't help another person who is drowning if you are 
     in a vulnerable position of going under yourself.  So I do agree that 
     those of us who are capable should get our ducks squarely lined up 
     (financially and otherwise).  However, I don't think we need to spend 
     extra time wringing out our wet clothes while the needy continue to 
     thrash in water over their heads.  They don't KNOW how to swim.  
     Whether it's their fault or they deserve what they get is secondary 
     when they are about to perish.
     
     Also, let me just reiterate that financial investment is not an issue 
     I disdain.  I'd like to become more adept at understanding the current 
     mechanism and I'm appreciating the contributions made along this 
     thread.  I am concerned at how quickly we forget where we came from in 
     our own financial climb.  Our "standard of living" gets higher, we 
     want more "stuff" and there seems to be less connection to the 
     community needs and our ability to assist.  
     
     Looking to the future with a more extropian outlook, I'd like to see a 
     move beyond the current concept of market economy.  Nanotechnology, if 
     its promise of providing everything from manufactured electronics to 
     assembled filet mignon, could facilitate a smooth transition from a 
     hoarding, survivalist self-oriented mentality to a connected, 
     supportive and benevolent one. I think utopia is possible and I refuse 
     to believe that humanity isn't capable of transcending instinctual, 
     animalstic tendencies to survive at all costs.  
     
     If extropian thinking means pushing the envelope, I'd like to include 
     the eventual elimination of the apathy we use as a protection against 
     feeling for those who "have not" (those on the economic edge who 
     unluckily fall off) or "can not" (mentally ill/emotionally abused).  
     The other group, the "will nots"--that group of non-contributors who 
     prefer non-participation--are a tougher group for which to drum up 
     genuine compassion.  I don't know how to regard people who expect to 
     live in a structured community but not contribute to it.
     
     As I become more aware of the tenets of libertarianism, I'm still not 
     sure at how compassion for the disenfranchised sector fits into the 
     schema.  From what I can perceive, impassive and continuous giving is 
     considered a dysfunctional form of "enabling", only serving to 
     perpetuate their lack of usefulness.  I don't want to have tax dollars 
     going toward a feeble welfare system, one so over-burdened with 
     bureaucracy that people blatantly take full advantage of it and suck 
     it dry.  But how can I stand in judgment of that type of person when 
     in some capacity, we all take advantage of a system, whether it's 
     driving past the agreed upon speed limit, eluding building permit 
     rules, excluding items on our tax returns, or using company e-mail to 
     spout our personal agendas <G>.  The welfare hackers just seem more 
     obvious and, perhaps despicable, because they are lower in the class 
     system and provide no ongoing contribution to justify the peccadilloes 
     of their higher class fellow citizens.
     
     Perhaps a question to end with is how does extropian 
     living/thinking/feeling empower beyond the self?  Is self-empowerment 
     the tried-and-true solution to community/national/planetary 
     enhancement or is it merely a notion of the noble-minded 
     intellegencia?

Here are my thoughts.

1) The markets are not perfectly efficient -- perfect efficiency
   requires perfect information transfer. The fact that markets are
   ever shifting, products ever changing, information always taking
   time to diffuse, means they can never be perfectly
   efficient. However, the markets are pretty damn close to efficient
   these days -- efficient enough that things like day trading are a
   risky way to make a living.
2) It is possible to exploit market inefficiencies to make money. I've
   seen people who are just too far out of the statistical spectrum to
   be accidents -- traders like Paul Tudor Jones and Louis
   Bacon. These people are, however, unusual. I've seen far, far more
   people who can't manage to trade their way out of a paper
   bag.
3) The people who are guaranteed a place at the banquet are the casino
   owners. Brokers always get their vig. Traders -- especially
   amateurs -- don't always do so well. In the futures market, friends
   of mine at Refco tell me the average time between opening a futures
   trading account and losing *ALL* your stake is about a year.
4) The people who do manage to make money "trading" rather than
   "investing" are almost inevitably full time professionals who are
   very, very smart -- and even they sometimes "blow up". The author
   of the famous "Memoirs of a Stock Operator", Larry Livingston,
   killed himself a few years after writing his book after losing
   every penny he had.

My advice is therefore this: if you feel like you are drawn to the
securities markets and are young when you start and a risk taker, much
money is to be made from trading. However, you won't find that most of
the people in the Forbes 400 got there this way, and its a dangerous
way to make a living. For every guy that turns out to have the right
combination of tallent and luck, hundreds or thousands lose their
shirts.

On the other hand....

1) Over the long term, the stock market DOES outperform almost all
   other investments -- and outperforms it handsomely.
2) You don't even have to think much to make money in the markets:
   passive investments like buying into an S&P 500 following mutual
   fund do bring their investors excellent returns.
3) Even random portfolios of sufficient size do pretty well in
   general.
4) People who have a slight information edge -- like understanding
   what a high tech company does -- can sometimes get an advantage
   even if they aren't full time investors.

My advice is therefore simple.

If you want to be rich, you have two options:

Option one: get a good job, save as much of your money has you can
bear to starting when you are young, and invest it in mutual funds or
in a diversified porfolio. If you wait long enough, the returns will
be good. The higher paying the job, the more you can afford to
save. Almost everyone can do this and be assured of living comfortably
if you have enough patience. No, it isn't glamorous, and it won't make
you "filthy rich". However, as the toroise and the hare found out,
slow and steady often wins. If you can save 20% or more of your income
and you invest all of it, in ten or twenty years you'll find yourself
with a nice amount of cash.

Option two: start a high growth business. This is the most practical
way to become "filthy rich". It is, however, stressful and not for
everyone -- and not everyone has good ideas.

Combining these strategies is, of course, perfectly reasonable.

Perry

Personally I'm less than over-excited about welfare; the numbers don't
seem very large.  AFDC isn't breaking the budget; Social Security and
Medicare are.  But single mothers don't vote as well as senior
citizens.  (And most people anticipate retiring.)

I'd like to echo Perry's comments.

The most important point is: if you value your future, invest in it.

Instead of having as much fun now spending your time and money on lots
of fun stuff, save more of your money, and spend more of your time
working, either for someone else, on ventures you think will pay off
later, or learn marketable skills.

On saving money, it is much less important how exactly you save/invest
than how *much* you save/invest.  Index mutual funds avoid trading
losses, and if you can avoid taxes, such as via IRAs, all the better.

Avoid making bets with other people, and everything but buying an
average such as an index *is* a bet.  One of you will lose the bet and
the broker will take a cut.  Are you really sure they don't know
something you don't?  (Raw bets are a great way to demonstrate
confidence and to create a reliable consensus, but they can be a lousy
investment.)

When investing in personal skills and new ventures, rather than in
financial markets, there is less market arbitrage and so a better
chance that your new idea really is better.  But try to be honest with
yourself about the degree to which you just enjoy this "investment"
activity, vs. it really having a big chance of paying off well.
Opening a new place to eat, or taking flying lessons, are mostly done
for the fun of it.

Lots of the Asian tigers have really high savings rates.  They may not
know as much about the future as American engineers do, but they know
that they care about it a lot.

Thanks.  I enjoyed flipping through the articles.  Especially, Al
Goldstein's satire on virtual sex. "So far, cybersex is cybercipher to me."
Much of the sex I've seen on the Internet is not real thrilling.  More
virtual erotica would be desirous, but not found in anything that I've seen yet.

"Is sex dirty?" asks Woody Allen. "Only if it's done right."

Yes.  A while back, I started a thread "Extropians Investing in the Future."
The responses were quite informed.  Over the months, I have been meeting
with a couple of friends to discuss stock and investments portfolios.  Since
this time, I have begun taking charge of my own investments.  By using the
services of a discount broker, I am more apt to pay attention to the
direction of my investments,  rather than relying on brokerage firms.

One aspect of taking charge of one's investments is to learn from another's
mistakes.  I would gladly share some of my blunders as well as success and
insights with  investments, especially real estate.

If anyone is interested in furthering either local or virtual meetings,
please keep me advised.

Also, a delightful book to read is _The Richest Man In Babylon_.

This so interesting to me because I spoke with Michael Ventura a few years
ago about transhumans.  I was pitching a story for him to write the the LA
Weekly.  We had an forthright conversation about the future but when it was
all said and done, he said he had no interest in the future from an
optimistic vantage.  He chose to write from the belly of the beast.

Yes, I have had a few laughs over that one.  I just tell people, that is
those who will be taking white collar jobs, that I intend to make people's
lives better by kicking them out of work.  On a side note, when people say
we cannot automate anymore they are saying that society's mental capacity
is stretched to its fullest.  How pessimistic.

I'll admit to a decent probability that "The best way to help others is to
help yourself," may only work in a completely free market but I can come up
with a good argument for it now.  Say I have the choice between wringing
out my clothes and saving the drowning  people (at little risk to myself
other than wet clothes).  There is a decent chance that once this person
has recovered they will be grateful and may do something for me.  For
instance, they may buy me dinner or give me some sort of reward or just owe
me a favor (assuming I will see them again).  So long as the probability of
reward  X  the amount of the reward is greater than the cost of wet clothes
(p  X  a  > c) I will be helping myself by helping another.  This can be
extended to a real world situation by considering the chance that educating
a large number of people will end up benefiting you (either directly or
indirectly) more than any other use of your resources.  

Of course, in a completely free market, prices will indicate where
resources are most in demand.

Once again, assisting others can be seen as a form of investing.  Good
feelings can be considered a return as well.  It's important not to condemn
someone for enjoying a 42" television more than the good feelings generated
by helping others.  Enjoyment is somewhat irrational anyone (of course,
that does not mean its a bad thing, just it is a goal to be pursued by
rational means).

That's what extropy is all about.  I am trying to move beyond human
instincts (beyond human actually) and, in the end, I intend to carry others
with me.  By that time hoarding will be irrelevant.  The more material
resources one has the more freedom they have (they have the option to give
it away as well).  In a post human existence more material resources will
mean investment in the self through faster hardware and expanded memory
(granted this is an oversimplification but forgive me for being human, it's
a condition I'm working on overcoming).

Actually, I'm just evading unjust limits on my freedom.  I never agreed to
those constraints and since there is a monopoly held by force I have no
other options.  LGW did a good job of expressing the problems with the
welfare system in general.

I guess the question is this:  Is society as we know it today built on

First off I should say that Robin's point about humans holding onto the
niche for generality for long enough, is interesting and I have nothing
to say but hmm.

Damien Broderick writes-

Interesting scenario: a mass-produced personality.  Everyone would get
to know it intimately (unlike the way everyone knows public personalities
superficially).  They'd know its flaws, share tricks for dealing with it...
and meanwhile each of the instances would have the same blind spots to
the same faults.  In fact you could get a mass version of that two-person
dynamic where character traits and conflicts get exaggerated.

But you could also have copies that broke the mold in one way or another,
which would provide an interesting kind of example of the potential of
individuality and transcending limitations.

I didn't actually realize until now that this came in on the extropian list.
I thought it was from SNES-L or KAG-L or possibly the Modslist .. I have to
go, EVERY DEAD BIOLOGIST IS SPINNING IN THEIR (respective) GRAVE, and I have

***********************************************************************

   JOURNAL OF MEMETICS - Evolutionary Models of Information 
               Transmission (JOM-EMIT)

***********************************************************************

JOM-EMIT is a new scientific journal published exclusively on the Web, 
at URL:

     http://www.cpm.mmu.ac.uk/jom-emit

The journal has no subscription fee.

JOM-EMIT is the first peer-reviewed journal devoted to the development 
of the memetic perspective. This perspective looks at culture, 
communication and information transmission as evolutionary phenomena, 
governed by the mechanisms of variation, replication and selection. The 
concept of "meme" was proposed by Richard Dawkins as 'a unit of 
cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation'. The vagueness of this
initial 
description may explain the present diversity of views on what a meme 
really is, and how the memetic model can be used. JOM-EMIT wishes to 
clarify these issues, by stimulating a constructive dialogue between the 
active researchers in the field. More specifically JOM-EMIT seeks to 
discuss the following topics related to memetics: 

- Comparisons of different mechanisms and models of evolutionary 
processes, possibly in distinct fields of inquiry. 

- Philosophical or theoretical issues concerning epistemology and 
evolution 

- Boundaries of the evolutionary approach 

- Empirical research on memetic processes 

- Models of meme generation and meme spread 

- Fundamental approaches aimed at structuring the field of memetics as a 
science 

Editorial Board: Gary Boyd, Bruce Edmonds (also publisher), Liane 
Gabora, Francis Heylighen, Mark Mills, Hans-Cees Speel (managing 
editor), and Mario Vaneechoutte.

Advisory Board: Gary Cziko, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, David 
Hull, and Aaron Lynch.

The JOM-EMIT site contains two mailing lists: an announcement list for 
the distribution of abstracts of new papers to all subscribers, and a 
discussion list for open debate on the submitted papers, and other 
memetics related issues. You can subscribe to these lists via the
Journal's 
home page.

                    CONTENTS

The first issue (May-September) of JOM-EMIT is now online. It 
contains four papers and one book review:

"The Six Essentials? Minimal Requirements for the Darwinian 
Bootstrapping of Quality" by William H. Calvin

"Cultural R/K Selection" by Agner Fog

"The Origin and Evolution of Culture and Creativity" by Liane Gabora

"Macromemetics and the Re-unification of Philosophy" by Derek 
Gatherer

Book review: "Evolutionary Paradigms in the Social Sciences. Special 
Issue, International Studies Quarterly 40, (September, 1996)" by Francis 
A. Beer.

New papers will appear continuously when they are accepted for 
publication.

                 CALL FOR PAPERS

We invite interested authors to submit papers for the journal, along
with 
information on the author, his/her address and affiliations, at the
journal's 
email address:

     jom-emit@sepa.tudelft.nl

All submitted papers will be anonymously reviewed. They will only be 
accepted for publication if approved by at least two referees.

Controversial papers of high quality can be followed by commentaries by 
request of the author after they are published (similar to the
commentary 
structure the "Brain and Behavioral Sciences" uses, although JOM-EMIT 
uses commentary only as an option after a paper is already published). 
This means that a number of peers write a short comment, to which the 
author can reply in a concluding short paper.

We also wish to invite letters which criticize published papers, and
book

First off I should say that Robin's point about humans holding onto the

Interesting scenario: a mass-produced personality.  Everyone would get
to know it intimately (unlike the way everyone knows public personalities
superficially).  They'd know its flaws, share tricks for dealing with it...
and meanwhile each of the instances would have the same blind spots to
the same faults.  In fact you could get a mass version of that two-person
dynamic where character traits and conflicts get exaggerated.

But you could also have copies that broke the mold in one way or another,
which would provide an interesting kind of example of the potential of
individuality and transcending limitations.

It doesn't take very much.  I would say that $50/month is a rough minimum.
I started with even less than that many years ago.  However, investing this
much money limits your options considerably.  Your best option at this
level of investment is mutual funds until you can grow your cash.

More importantly, though, is that you put aside a minimum amount *every
month*.  This is the real key to investing.

I am sometimes surprised to the tendency of some extro list subscribers to
apply concepts from the boolean domain to the real world, a complex,
shifting place. E.g. the collar color classification is completely
artificial, as new-generation devices will make their way, both into
office and production line automation.

The question is how to organize semiubiquitous welfare, which we are
obviously going to need, into something incapacitating, instead of
debilitating.

I would recommend trading via the web.  Not only is it the cheapest way to
trade (per share), but brokers are often poor sources of information.
Commissions vary not only with the amount of stock they sell, but which
stock they sell.  As my mother ( a stock broker and regional manager for a
large brokerage house ) often reminded me, half the brokers she ever worked
with would routinely lie to their clients to make extra money.

I would be very interested in hearing about your real estate investments.
I am not an expert on real estate investing but am very interested in it.

The markets are far from perfect.  There are many wildly over-valued
companies (some over-valued for reasons I can't possibly fathom) and many
undervalued companies as well.  Also, the values of all securities are
based on the expected *future* value and earnings, not the current book value.

The keys to making money on the market are sufficient education on how the
market really works, and doing enough research to make informed decisions.
"Buy low, sell high" is not enough knowledge to make money on the market.
You have to be able to tell when "high" is really high and "low" is really
low.  The vast majority of people who trade do not know enough information
to make trading a "guaranteed" thing.  And listening to your stock broker
is almost always a surefire way to *not* make much money.

Futures are a very dangerous market to trade; futures are even dangerous to
seasoned experts.  Futures is one of the few markets I will not trade in.
Amateurs trading futures are foolhardy.

There are many successful part-time traders.  At every brokerage there are
one or two clients who average 100% return every year, a small group of
clients who average 50% every year, and a very large number who average 10%
a year.  To lose everything requires holding risky positions in a
non-diverse portfolio.

Safe and profitable, but not aggressively profitable.  It will take decades
to grow a sizeable sum, especially if you are starting small.

Random portfolios are stupid.  You might as well invest in a mutual fund,

This is also a good option.  As I am fond of telling people: "Statistically
you are 1000 times more likely to become a millionaire working hard and
starting a business than playing the California Lottery."   Yet a lot more
people play the lottery than start a business or invest.

So many people want it handed to them.

I have a third option:

Taking the time to do adequate research and to make informed decisions pays
off handsomely.  I probably spend 20 hours per month doing research and
educating myself on the market.  As a result, I have done very well over
the years, and far better than the indices.  I am usually holding 6 to 8
stock positions at any one time and have not had a negative month that I
can remember.  To date this year I have averaged ~8% return every month.
(Disclaimer: past performance is not a guarantee of future returns.)  Some
years are better than others, but I consistently do far better than the
market by making intelligent trades and not reacting to the fluctuations
and fickleness of the market (especially the NASDAQ!).  I rarely hold a
stock position more than a year and often no more than 6 months.

For those with only small amounts of money to invest (say $50 per month), I
would recommend investing in growth oriented mutual funds.  The brokerage
houses penalize small trades heavily.  Trading stocks starts to become
economical when you have enough money saved to start buying at least 40-50
shares per trade.


There is some risk involved, but there is no need to put such a grim spin
on trading.  There are many people who make consistent profits as
part-time, amateur traders.

Its true. The human body is more than just human cells---it a symbiosis
with several other species in benign interactions like these.

The best example is the small, microscopic creatures that live under
each eyelash....as best as anyone can tell, we are born with them, so
somehow, they get there during development...perhaps even inherited from
the mother just like mitocondria.

Yes, we are filled with symbiotes. But I seriously doubt that the
mites living in our follicles are as essential for them as the
original poster suggested; in that case mice bred in sterile
environments would be hairless. But I wouldn't be surprised if the
mites actually have co-evolved some useful functions, like keeping
away certain bacteria. 

This brings up an interesting idea that was discussed a few months
back: how we can improve our symbiotes, or even make artificial ones. 
Purely aesthetically I have always wanted tailored skin bacteria
making sweat smell like perfume.

Another fun idea I read about in _The Biomechanical Engineering
Handbook_ (Ed Joseph Bronzino, CRC 1995) is to encapsulate
hormone-producing cells in semi-permeable capsules which lets small
molecules through but not antibodies, cells or similar stuff. This
way xenografts could be used to produce hormones, neurotransmittors
or whatever with no danger of immune reactions to them.

I read an article (in Fortune, I think) that warned investors to be careful
with index funds based on the Dow or the S&P 500. The writer noted that
these stocks may be overvalued because index investing has become so
incredibly popular that these stocks just keep getting pushed up. The
writer suggested broader index funds, such as those based on the Wilshire
5000. I'd be very interested to hear comments on this.

Yes, if only I'd known more about Dell a year ago...

Warren Buffett's approach makes a lot of sense to me. It's too bad that he
doesn't know much about high tech and so won't invest in that area. My one
and only investment so far (Coca Cola) was inspired by Buffett, though I
think I should have gone with Microsoft, as I almost did but it's price was
relatively high at the time. I'm happy so far though: I bought my few
shares of stock a month ago. It's up 13%, so I can boast -- for now! -- of
an annualized return of 156%.

Given a Buffett approach, perhaps an investment club could serve as a way
of spreading expert knowledge on particular companies among people in the
group. Of course there is no guarantee that someone who claims to be an
expert on Company ! really is an expert, but this might be a reasonably way
of figuring out which stocks to pick, when you're not satisfied with boring
but sensible index funds.

For those who haven't come across it, I recommend Microsoft Investor as a
fine way to keep track of investments. Unfortunately, while expanding its
features, Microsoft are about to start charging $9.95 per month for it.

You may believe, based on "gut" that the markets aren't efficient, but
the statistics don't bear this out. In particular, attempts at
objective metrics like those used in so-called "Value Investing" turn
out not to work very well.

Of course, the question of what "sufficient education" means is rather
hard to quantify. I've seen many smart people fail miserably in the
markets, or decieve themselves into thinking they were outperforming
the market higher than statistical chaance would permit.

Futures aren't in fact more dangerous than other markets. The reason
they are perceived as dangerous is because they permit so much
leverage. However, there is no real difference between buying an S&P
500 future and buying the S&P 500 as a basket, or between buying wheat
futures and buying wheat. The temptation, however, is to use the
leverage to acquire a position that is too large for you.

BTW, some of the richest men I know became rich in futures trading. On
the other hand, they have lots of expertise and intelligence, and they
are a rare breed. I'd never try it and I don't recommend it.

You do realize, though, that just random chance would lead to this
distribution, correct?

What you are advocating is "active investing", the notion that you can
do much better than the market by just putting a fairly modest amount
of time in. I don't really believe that strongly any more. It is
demonstrably possible that you can do better than the market -- but it
isn't easy. Remember, if it was, everyone would do it. The markets
*are* fairly efficient.

Well, "slow and steady wins the race". Better to get a nice steady 15%
a year than zero.

I see you haven't been following the research.

In fact, a large random portfolio isn't especially stupid. It tracks
the market average well. Most people can't afford sufficient
diversification to get a large random portfolio -- you need a lot of
different stocks to make one track the market properly -- and you are
likely to do as well far more easily with an index fund, but there is
little reason to refer to a large random portfolio as "stupid", and
there is little reason to believe an active mutual fund to be "safer".

This is the question: is your performance truly out of line with the
markets? Absolute returns aren't very interesting -- returns relative
to market, and the statistical likelyhood of getting there by
accident, are far more interesting.

Also, remember -- higher return often is a sign of higher risk.

I'll point out that the second richest man in the U.S., Warren

40 or 50 shares is still too small -- you pay extra commission for odd
lots, and round lots are always multiples of 100 shares except for
oddball stocks like Berkshire Hathaway which trades at $30,000 a share.

True enough, but it isn't trivial. *That* you save and invest steadily
is far more important than *if*.

I don't want to sound like a naysayer -- there is nothing wrong with
picking your own stocks. However, it isn't the way most people are
going to become rich, and it is *real work*. If you are better at some
other profession, investment is not the road to getting rich
quick. Indeed -- there ARE no roads to getting rich "quick" that work
reliably.

The thing I keep hearing is that the stock market's performance over the
last 10 years or so has been unusually good compared to historical
averages.  The implication is that stocks would be expected to underperform
over the next decade, either returning to their average growth rates
or possibly even falling lower to compensate for the recent spurt.  If
this is right, then the stock market, particularly the index averages,
may not be the place to be, unless your time horizon is very far out
(20-40 years).

Is this about the U.S. or the world?  If about the U.S., it might be a
good time to invest abroad.  

Its worth pointing out that if the value of your future wages is tied
to the U.S., because of your knowledge and contacts in the U.S., and
if U.S. wages correlate with U.S. stock returns, as they seem to, then
diversification would argue for putting more of your money abroad,
perhaps to the point of holding no U.S. investments.  

See:  Baxter & Jermann, "The international diversification puzzle is
worse than you think", American Economic Review, March '97, p. 170.

Of course if you're betting instead of investing, then you may prefer
to bet on things you know best.

As far as anyone can tell, the stock market averages move in a random walk.
So they don't alternate up and down decades (as you suggest) nor are they
going to keep going up because of 'momentum' (as the zillions of people
currently putting their life savings into mutual funds seem to believe).

Technically speaking, the values of the S&P500 (or any other broad market
average) move in a pattern statistically indistinguishable from a biased
Levy flight (which is a particular type of random walk more vulnerable to
massive sudden ups and downs than the usual Gaussian random walk).  The bias
is, fortunately, upward.  This makes stocks a good investment if you're
willing to not get your money back for fifteen or twenty years.  I just
moved $30,000 from real estate into a mutual fund this morning.  Assuming
nothing too drastic happens, I plan to spend that money sometime in the
second quarter of the twenty-first century.

The long term historical average for the major indices is 10% < return <
11% depending on the index.  The indices are expected to perform very
poorly in 5+/-2 years for a term of 5-10 years.  As I stated previously,
the short-term growth of the indices is due in part to a demographic shift
which is pumping a lot more money into the economy than would normally
occur.  Index funds will probably be good investments for about two years
or so.  After that I would consider investing in non-tracking funds.

Objective metrics don't work well primarily because of market inefficiency.
 When you look at the markets, especially at a fine granularity, there
tends to be a high level of arbitrary action that is doesn't model very
well.  Models do start to make sense when the granularity gets coarser,
however.

How smart you are makes no difference when it comes to investing.  Although
sufficient education is a loose term, it does imply significant knowledge
of relevant subjects.  Being smart won't help you if you don't have enough
information or knowledge to make an informed decision.

You misread the statistical distribution.  The *number* of people in each
category do follow statistical distribution, but that they make as much as
they do is *not* statistical.  I was referring to individuals producing
consistent returns above and beyond the markets year after year.

For an individual to consistently outperform the markets year after year is
not random chance.

You are right.  It isn't that easy.  It takes time and experience to start
producing consistent above market performance.  Very few investors take the
time to really investigate their positions.  The top reasons people invest
in a company are "a friend told them it was a good company to invest
in","the company has 'cool' products", and "they heard the company was in a
hot market".  None of these reasons justify investing in any company, yet
most people invest this way and lose money by it.

Just because so few amateur investors invest properly doesn't mean that
none do, or that it is impossible to learn.

15%?  Not on an index fund.  Realistically, it is more like 10-12%, with
10.x% being the long-term historical range.

Why would you want to track the market average?  The market averages are
not spectacular (and don't let the market boom of the last couple years
fool you).  You would be better off buying into a smaller mutual fund that
doesn't track markets.  There are non-tracking mutual funds that haven't
had a negative return in 75 years, yet the market has historically spent a
significant amount of time in the red.

By "absolutely", I was stating that you are in a position to make a wise
investment.  That is, you would know whether to make an investment at all.
Knowing when not to invest is nearly as big an advantage as knowing when to
invest.

My returns are almost always significantly above the market.  To date I
have returned almost 50% on my stock investments this year.  The risk of my
portfolio is really very average.

For example, my current active (i.e. short-term) portfolio ( I do have
long-term positions, but not many ) is:

WLA - Warner-Lambert Company  ( big pharmaceutical group )
TQNT - Triquint Semiconductor ( gallium-arsenide communications chip design
and fab )
VISX - VISX ( surgical lasers, esp. eye surgery )
SUNW - Sun Microsystems
DEC  - Digital Equipment Corp.

I've held all these stocks ~6 weeks (+/-2) and my return on this portfolio
for the last 6 weeks is 16.2% (after adjusting for costs of trading).

Indices for the same period (rounded to the nearest percent):

S&P 500:  +12%
NASDAQ:   +12%
Dow IA:   +12%

p.s. I wouldn't recommend buying these stocks now.  Most are past their
buying range and some are near their selling point.

That is his method of investment, and he has done well by it.  Give me as

Schwab charges $0.03/share or $29.95, whichever is higher.  You can buy
odd lots at no penalty.  Of course the exception to this is NASDAQ which is
almost always more expensive to trade on.

I am not saying this is a "get rich quick" scheme.  It will still take a
long time to accumulate real wealth, but the returns will be larger and
faster if you take an active interest in it.

Index funds will only remain a good choice for the next couple years and
for the really long term.  Broader funds, especially ones that represent
international markets, would be better choices for the medium-term.  For
mutual funds, I prefer ones that do not track a particular index, but you
have to shop more carefully to get good results.

Not to burst your bubble, but after trading costs, you pretty much tracked
the market indices for the same period.  Also, diversification is important
to reliable growth and lowering risk.

Real estate is categorized under my blunder list.  I was co-owner of two
homes in Colorado, one in a exclusive ski resort, the other in Boulder near
the University.  The houses were purchased at a low price.  I did a lot of
renovation on both homes, and enjoyed it immensely.  

The blunder was on the house in the ski resort.  We sold too soon -- just
before prices ski-rocketed.  It was commercially zoned, (my first business
was in this house).  Patience is a virtue in real estate.  My partners had
other priorities, although I wanted to hang on to the property.  Last time I
walked by the house, it was for sale for 16 2/3rd times price we sold it.
Big blunder.

Is it possible that something collects a spread-out

If the medium were "charged" somehow, maybe it could even
amplify the original source?

Thanks for that feedback. Since you and Perry seem to have some

Of course, but if you don't yet have enough money to diversify, the next
best thing is to pick one very safe stock. Given the markets still opening
to Coca Cola, I think it's a very safe bet. I intend to hold the stock for
many years.

>From what I remember of my astronomy course, it is a general principle that
an object which varies over a time scale t can't be much larger than t*c
in size.  Or, putting it the other way, an object which is t*c in size can't
be seen to vary strongly with time scales much less than t.

The reason is that, generally, the radiation will come to us from all over
the object, or at least all over the side of the object facing us.  The
distances to the different parts of the object, assuming it is t*c in size,
will therefore vary by around t*c/2 between the closest and farthest parts
of the object that we see.  We are really dealing with orders of magnitude
here so that is effectively about the same as t*c.

Now, if the object suddenly and uniformly changes its brightness,
we will still see the brightness to change over a period of about t.
First the closest part of the object will brighten, then the farther
parts, and so on.  There will be a difference in time of about t from
when we see the object start to brighten until the brightness change is
complete.

You can imagine geometries where this might not happen; for example, if
the object were plane shaped, and we were face on to it, and the whole
thing changed at once, then it could change suddenly in brightness even
though the plane was larger than t*c.  However this requires unusual
geometry, and in that case there should be a range of objects with
varying time scales but otherwise similar behavior (where the geometry
happens to be more typical), and I don't think that is the case with GRBs.

I'm not sure how Carl Feynmann got those incredible numbers about the
energy density within the GRB.  Presumably you look at its (huge) distance
from us, look at the energy we saw, assume that it was radiating that
much energy in all directions, and get a whole lot of energy.  Then the
whole event takes a few seconds, so it has to have all originated in a
small volume, and things get pretty hard to explain.

One thing I was thinking was that the radiation could perhaps be going
out in a tight beam.  GRB's would actually be much more common than we
see, but most of them miss us.  However you would still have extremely
high energy densities unless the beam is super tight.  Also the fact
that something was visible for hours or days afterwards doesn't sound
right for a tight-beam phenomenon.

 I can spare 50 bucks if everyone else spares 50 bucks .
Let's see... how many people are on this list ?
Last time I checked it was around 350, but that was a few months ago .
Who can be trusted with $17,500 ?

      I have found creatine very effective without bothering with the
"loading phase".  After 30+ years of letting myself go to pot after
participating in High School/College sports, I have begun exercising at
a gym with aerobic and weight lifting machines.

    The rate at which I have been building muscle and increasing
strength has be pretty surprising, especially considering I have been
pretty lackadaisical exercising only 2-4 days a week for only an hour or
less.  I certainly did not respond this rapidly to exercise when I was
physically in my prime. 30+ years ago.

    Maybe I should mention that I also take a GH releaser formula and
DHEA as well as the usual  array of nutrients, melatonin, DMAE, etc.

    Since my organization's name was taken in vain by Erik Moeller
below, I feel I must weigh in......  The big Ameican media is controlled
by police state methods, mainly intimidation by the CIA and FBI when the
chips are down.  See Ian Goddard's coverage of such activities in the
TWA case and the recent back down of the San Jose Mercury News regarding
the CIA-Contra-Crack connection.

    But Erik, America is not a "free enterprise" society.  It is State
Capitalism with the most powerful capitalists controlling the
regulations and taxes to their advantage.  Fortunately, we don't have
State Socialism where an Elite not only controls the commanding heights
of the economy, but stills independent economic activity on all levels.
Of course, there are plenty of stinking State Socialists like Hilary and
Bill who would like to bring the State into every little aspect of our
daily lives.

    Good grief!  How can you consider thorough going socialism better
than State Capitalism?  At least State Capitalism would leave the people
alone to fend for themselves!  State Socialists won't even allow that!

    Government is the enemy regardless of whether it is the instrument
of big capital or a stinking socialist elite.  America needs vastly more
free enterprise, not less!

    You are aware, I assume, that "the people" controlling a government,
any government is a myth.  Democracy is a myth by which an elite obtains
the consent of the governed.  That is why Kings instituted Parliaments
in the first place!

	WAX,
We must agree with you.  Most of those on this list do have an
"open-questioning mind", like most of the Mystics we have known.  We have
also found what we refer to as the "New-Age Space-Cadets" trying to pass
themselves off as Mystics, but they are generally tolerated at best,
however we usually try to keep a certain distance as they have a tendency
to bring unwarranted scorn about those who embrace Mysticism.
	Many Mystics believe that the human race is evolving, rather rapidly
lately, towards what Extros call transhuman.  They also embrace all that
man does as being "natural" as we come from and are part of nature.  We
have yet to find a good Luddite amongst them. :-)
	We are reading the last of the Mars trilogy "Blue Mars" by Kim Stanley
Robinson.  He obviously favours the Swiss model of Democracy to some
extent.  Have you, or anyone on this list, read these books?  If so, what
do you think about some of the ideas he puts forth as regards
terra-forming, politics...self-government,  and future colonization?
	Is his science sound?  We do not have enough background to know if he is
just making this stuff up or if he actually knows what he is talking
(writing) about.  He seems to have a wealth of information which he shares
in the books though.

I'm really disappointed at the number of -- yes, I'll say it -- fools
floating about on the extropians mailing list these days.

Its remotely possible that eyelashes are held in by tiny insects --
but unless someone can get me an article from a peer reviewed journal
that says so, I'm afraid I'm going to have spectacular amounts of
trouble believing it.

Beyond the insects, though, we've had a vast rush of fuzzy thinking
here lately -- perpetual motion machines, people informing us of what
a socialist paradise Cuba is, etc.

This is not the extropians list of yore where one could expect the
weakest speculation seen on the list to be of the nature "is beta
really a good predictor of market returns" or "how good is the
evidence for the life extension properties of chromium
picolinate". Its turned into a list where we have a group of people
who seem to be able to think well and clearly, and this other group
that has come from lord knows where, and wants to regale us with
information on how eating meat and potatoes will make your digestive
system seize up. (Understand, I'm a vegan, but...)

I have no trouble with free speech. I do, however, suggest that this
is not an appropriate forum for such discussions.

You take a five month return as being the least bit significant? Take
ten or fifteen random small portfolios and one of them is going to do
better than 15% in five months. Five month returns aren't even worth
mentioning.

I highly recommend that people read Victor Neiderhoffer's
autobiography "The Education of a Speculator". Victor is one of the
richest men I know. He got that way by futures trading. As he notes in
his book, his performance is enough standard deviations away from the
norm that it is spectacularly unlikely given the size of the
population that he could have gotten where he has by chance.

Victor is amazingly savage about all sorts of things -- he uses
statistics as a vicious weapon. I think his conclusion is more or less
the same as my far less informed opinion -- that smart, hard working
people can earn more than the market, but that the vast majority of
opinion about the market is spectacularly foolish, and that it isn't
easy to earn above average returns. His lancing of most investment
"advisors" is amazingly good reading.

Now, James makes fun of earning the "mere" 10% or 12% or whatever that
an index fund will get you. Well, I'd say that there is nothing wrong
with earning less than the maximum you possibly could. The real key is
to save and invest with a reasonable degree of confidence. Earning 50%
a year is nice if you can manage it, but there is nothing wrong --
nothing wrong -- with earning a "mere" 12%. 12% will turn even a
modest savings rate into a spectacularly comfortable retirement. I see
no reason for embarassment at such things.

I also see no embarassment in a decision like Max made to buy Coca
Cola. If it gets him a nice return over the long run, thats fine. If
it doesn't do that spectacularly, thats fine too. THAT Max is
investing is almost more important than in what -- provided we aren't
talking about really stupid investments like savings bonds.

I am not for all new ideas, no matter how lame.  I'm for good ideas,
new or old.

This group is open to new ideas, but will judge an idea source on its
track record.  I forget who said: "Its all well and good to have an
open mind, but don't let your brains fall out."

Aside from the trust issue, there are legal issues with doing this as well.
 The SEC gets annoyed when people invest money for groups using their
individual accounts.  You normally have to set up a group account which
involves extra paperwork and other hassles.

Except that I got an 86% return last year and 113% the year before.
My returns so far this year are slightly higher than I expected, but still
more or less in line with my usual return rate.  You are right, there is no
significance in 5 months worth of performance.  But I have been trading a
lot longer than 5 months.

I don't "make fun" of 10-12% returns.  For most people it is adequate,
especially if you don't want the hassle of watching your investments.
However, I don't agree with investing in index funds to get that 10-12%,
for reasons already stated.

There never was any embarassment in buying Coca Cola.  It is a proven
performer and a very safe investment for the long term.


I am not saying that active investing is for everyone.  It costs time and
promotes headaches.  But if you are willing to take the time and put forth
the effort, the returns can be substantially and consistently higher.

The Extropy Institute. I guess that would be a good investment.

     Thanks Natasha for your comment about Michael Ventura.  I've never met 
     the man.  Do you know what he meant about "the belly of the beast"?  
     Does the quote I mentioned seem to connect to the person you met or is 
     there incongruity there.  I'm very big on a person being the truth 
     s/he speaks.  Not always easy in error-prone humanity.  But my motto 
     is when you screw up, you atone and realign yourself to your creed.
     
     Brian, I'm familiar with Drexler's work and have not taken on 
     Nanosystems yet but read the much lighter, lay-friendly "Engines of 
     Creation".  I am optimistic that his dreams will be realized in our 
     lifetime!
     
     Regards

     Greetings,
     
     There seems to be an abundance of interest in and information provided 
     about how to invest in the market economy.  I've yet to thoroughly 
     peruse some of the ideas and perspectives since the thread has 
     dominated recent digests I receive (although the idea of investing in 
     a company like Coca-cola, simply because of its yet untapped 
     markets--presumably in developing nations--seems disconnected from the 
     consequences both to health and environment that result from its mass 
     consumption).  
     
     Why do I keep equating this type of capitalist-get-ahead preoccupation 
     with pure narcissism?  Could someone assist me in understanding how 
     post-human potentialities tie in with reasoning that doesn't seem to 
     link conscious choice with one's personal mission statement?  Perhaps 
     I'm in the wrong realm.  I was under the impression that extropian 
     principles had a more broad-sweeping implication, that they pushed the 
     envelope of sociological, physiological, psychological paradigms.  
     That benevolence would be a natural result of evolved thinking.  I 
     keep hoping to find it in the dozen or so digests I've received.  But 
     it I'm coming to the conclusion that it's "Ultra-Me", with a 
     proclivity towards the accumulation of material "stuff" in the current 
     consumer-based, opportunity-scrounging market economy.  Is that the 
     game we are forced to play for the time being?  Are we biding time, 
     collecting sufficient current-value resources?  Is extropian-ism a 
     methodical infiltration of the current motif? (Come to think of it, 
     are there any cultural changes that aren't?).
     
     As I re-read this, part of me is concerned about its candor.  I 
     apologize for any perceived haughtiness from this critical feedback 
     but it's only in an effort to understand and to contribute to the 
     definition, creed and itinerary of the post-human agenda.  Your 
     patience is requested.  If you feel your guard going up on any of 
     these issues, look at that more closely before instinctively clenching 
     your virtual fist okay?  I will not engage in any online spats for the 
     sake of "being right".  I want to be shown the road map of how you get 
     there from here on this route with this method of transporation, if 
     you'll indulge the metaphor.  
     
     Fundamentally, what is the division of energy for an extropian between 
     "business as usual" and "inventing a future that is heretofore 
     unrecognizable"?  As of late in this discussion, the scales are tipped 
     into the category of the former and my interest is beginning to wane.  
     I'll stay on the digest for a while yet to see what may come of this.
     
     Regards,
     
     
     Rick Knight

Yup.  A typical burst is 10^50 ergs if the source is 3000 megaparsecs away
and radiating equally in all directions.  The intensity here is 10^-7
ergs/cm^2.  If it was light instead of gamma rays, it would be as bright as
a 10 watt bulb two miles away, i.e. clearly visible to a dark-adapted eye.

Tight-beam vs omnidirectional is hard to decide obsrvationally.  As far as I
know, we can't tell yet.

If they do originate with stuff plowing into the interstellar medium at
>.9995 c, since we only see the radiation from the stuff that's aimed right
at us, there could perfectly well be a shell of stuff expanding in all
directions, and sending a burst in all directions, and it would look to us
like a tight-beam phenomenon.  In this case, the visible effect hours or
days afterward would be the fireball produced by the stuff after it had
decellerated to a moderate .99 c (say).

It *should* send a shiver down your spine.  Okay, that's not creepy enough,
get this: gamma rays at the density of lead are as opaque to gamma rays as
lead is.  In other words, if you could pile up such a ball of gammas, they
wouldn't be able to get out!  Only the ones at the surface would be able to
escape, then the ones beneath them, etc.  The time it would take for all the
radiation to dribble out would be longer than the duration of a gamma ray
burst.  So it impossible to get gamma rays out of an object as small as a
burster in times as fast as a burster.

How to solve this problem?  Well, if whathever makes the burst is moving
towards us at close to the speed of light, it will be running just behind
the light that we see it with, so we will see things on it happening faster
than they actually occur.  It turns out that it is possible to get the
energy release of a burster if the source is moving toward us at 0.9995 c or
faster.  Moreover, it turns out that pretty much anything moving at that
speed through the interstellar medium will make a gamma ray burst when it
plows into interstellar hydrogen atoms.  The plowing process takes many
hours before the projectile slows down, but we see it compressed into a few
seconds because the projectile is traveling only a smidgen behind the gamma
rays it produces.  So *something* is throwing around chunks of stuff at
unheard-of speeds, by mechanisms unknown.  

If the chunks are not moving directly toward us, we wouldn't see them nearly
as easily because almost all the radiation is emitted in the forward
direction.

Actually, a conversion efficiency of 0.1% of the mass would be entirely
sufficient.  Remember that a 3000 km ball of lead is only the mass of a
largish planet.  Convert Neptune into pure energy and you'd have a pretty
good gamma ray burst.  Since stars are thousands of times more massive than
planets, a conversion efficiency of 10^-3 is plenty.

10^50 ergs at 3000 megaparsecs.  It's a big envelope.

>If a hole eats a pulsar in one fell gulp, how much energy is released

10^53 ergs.  Most of the energy in that case goes into neutrinos and gravity
waves, but there might be enough left over to make a burst (by mechanisms
unknown, ha ha!)

>And why does my every darn sentence seem to end with a question

Well, nobody understands these things.  At least now that we know they come
from cosmic distances, we can throw out *half* of the theories that people
have come up with.  A few years, there were 100 theories and less than 100
known bursts.  Now there are 1000 bursts and only about two dozen theories.

Doesn't work.  The intensity-vs-time curves of observed bursts are very
variable, and often start fast and end slow, while evaporating primordial
black holes all look the same, and start slow and end fast. 

I know so much about this because I just read an article on the topic in a
nifty book called "Unsolved Problems in Astrophysics".  The book was written
nine months ago, so it's only slightly obsolete.  I think astrophysics is
running on Internet time nowadays.

I came across two books today: a recent one (1997): "Head Mounted Display
-- designing for the user", James E. Melzer & Kirk Moffit, McGraw Hill,
ISBN 0-07-041819-5. 

It is expensive, but has one intriguing, albeit brief, chapter in it: 
"Brain-Actuated Control (BAC) & HMDs". Accurate, and in-depth. Almost
bought it. Anyone interested in fringe GUIs should check it out. 


The other one (from 1991, or so) is to remain anonymous, as I haven't
written up the title. It was about the role molecular modelling in
investigation of cellular signalling, neurotransmitters/receptor
interaction included. I was thinking ab initio upoading when leafing
through it, but designing symbiontes from scratch is about as adequate in
its scope. 

Talking about simulating cell development, and operation in a computer run
is pretty ridiculous, nowadays. However, from HUGO data & wet context we
can progress very far, if we use stringent simulation validation by the
underlying simulation layer, all the way up the overlapping systems
ladder. (I think Nippon has a project with one of its many focuses on it
now started. Nippon likes to spend lots of money on dumb projects, but I
think this one is a good investment on their part). 

Even given our delicately prying experimental techiques, ab wet initio
might provide us with crucial information unavailable from experimental
data alone. We should definitely look into it. Imo.

It looks to me like nanotech would be a bad investment at the present time
(unless you use the term very broadly to include biotech and the like).
I don't even know what companies you would count as a nanotech investment.
But supposing you could find a startup somewhere that was claiming to
do R&D towards Drexlerian nanotech, with a payoff just a few years out,
this would be a very questionable investment.

The Idea Future (now called Foresight Exchange) market prediction of when
nano-scale robot arms and circuitry will come into being is around the year
2025 or so.  So maybe in 20 years it will be a good investment, but not now.

John Walker of Autodesk, a successful CAD company, got interested in
nanotech and other Drexlerian ideas back in the 1980's.  The company lost
a bundle on Xanadu, the Drexler-influenced hypertext publishing project.
(See Ed Regis' "Nano" for more on Drexler & Xanadu.)  Eventually they
had to retrench and focus on their core business instead of these blue
sky ideas.

Nanotech is a good example of an area where Extropians are vulnerable to
being seduced by sexy sounding technology.  We have to remain skeptical and
look at these ideas critically.  Nanotech has a lot of potential but it's
not just around the corner.

Simple.  Because many ideas are stupid.  We all admire imaginitive
speculation, but when all those marvellous ideas have been thrown
into the soup, the next task is to sort out those that might stand
some chance of being useful, and discard the others without remorse.
That's how progess is made: evolution by mutation and /selection/.

For those who are still skeptical, this from Entomology 133 at U.C. Riverside.
Beware of believing a story entirely false because it has a fantastic
headline.  I practice with National Enquirer, which actually often has quite
mundane stories behind its outrageous cover, occasionally.

Kennita

follicle mite, Demodex folliculorum (Simon) (Demodicidae)

Demodicids are mites that live in the sebaceous pores and hair
follicles, usually on the nose, forehead, cheek, and chin. However,
they may inhabit follicles, with or without hair, anywhere on the
body. When "blackheads" are squeezed out of the skin and
examined under the microscope, demodicids are sometimes found,
but there is apparently no evidence that the mites cause the
blackheads. Demodicids have a curious body form the long, striate
abdomen giving them a somewhat wormlike appearance (figure
323). Their legs are mere stumps. They have been found on as many
as 97% and 100% of adults examined in different surveys. Children
and adolescents are seldom infested. Among adults, those with oily
skin or who use cosmetics such as lubricating creams extravagantly
and fail to cleanse the skin properly are the ones particularly subject
to infestation (Ayres and Anderson, 1932; Ayres, 1963; Ayres and
Mihan, 1967; Morgan and Coston, 1964; Coston, 1967). Demodex
folliculorum infests hair follicles and D. brevis Akbulatova infests
sebaceous glands (Desch and Nutting, 1972). Both may be present
on the same individual, but D. folliculorum is the species that has
received the most attention.

Description and Habits. The mite is less than 0.4 mm long, and
usually escapes notice. Its developmental period is about 14.5 days
(Coston, 1967). Inflammation and secondary infection often result
when a large number of mites congregate in a single follicle. A
Demodex type of acne rosacea or "rosacea-like demodicidosis"
affecting the medial portion of the face is believed to result from
excessive numbers of follicle mites; it disappears rapidly following
the topical application of a suitable antiparasitic medication (Ayres,
1963; Ayres and Mihan, 1967; Morgan and Coston, 1964).

Bacteria have been located on the bodies of D. folliculorum,
suggesting the potential of this mite as a mechanical transmitter of
disease germs (English et al., 1970).

The follicle mite can cause an inflammatory condition of the eyelids
called demodex blepharitis. Many mites can be found clinging to or
migrating about on extracted eyelashes. As many as 25 mites have
been seen clinging near the root end of a single eyelash, "packed
together like sardines" (Coston, 1967). The infested eyelashes may
be soggy or waterlogged, and sometimes can be pulled out with
virtually no resistance (English,1971).

The phrase refers to his interest in digging deep into dark issues and
residing there while observing that society.  He has a keen insight into
life from this angle, as if he were, possibiliy, a cinematographer
documenting life from the "inside" of Hades.  Not all his writing is dark,
however.  I have enjoyed his pieces, from many perspectives.  As he enjoyes
quality jazz, humor, and the lifestyle of West Hollywood; it permeates his
writing.

I suppose he, like most people, has contraditions in his makeup.  And, a

Well, if you have an object that is emitting a jet of radiation from one
or both of its poles, or say, a pulsar with a rotating beam. THe object
explodes or implodes for some reason. Say a neutron star hits another
neutron star. At least one of these neutron stars is just below the
threshold to be a black hole. When they hit, the combined mass tips over
the limit to become a singularity, and they implode in a huge gush of
radiation. THere are bound to be some wild warping and tearing of
spacetime as these two rotating bodies merge. Additionally, a neutron
star is not pure neutronium. It usually has a decently thick crust of
material, typically denser than iron, as such elements have a negative
fusion energy balance. A huge rush of radiation from the implosion would
instantly fission, fuse, and possibly totally annihilate a large portion
of the crust material, creating even more radiation, while the remainder
would expand in a hugely flourescent cloud which will form a nebula,
slowly dimming over time as it expands.

In that case they are unusually unimaginative. We already have
transgenic cows that produce human growth hormone (or something
similar, my memory is foggy right now), and adding genes for drugs or
other useful stuff to bees ought to be even simpler. I'm not sure
what alternative food products you are thinking of, but I definitely
think bees could be used for producing a lot of stuff.

I wonder what kind of scavengers might work in a apartment to clean
it up?  Cockroaches and ants seem to be obvious choices, but are
there others?

What an interesting idea.  You would, however, have to find a way to 
protect your hives from these massive epidemics that bees seem to be 
prey to.  Last year most honey-producing hives in the Southeast and 
Mid-Atlantic were wiped out by some virulent disease.  Honey sold 
in the local farmers' markets is now brought in from points north
until the local beekeepers can restore their hives.

Sin,

The original claim was "I heard from someone that little bugs keep our
eyelashes in. And when our eyelashes fall out its because the bugs die."
The NOVA reference Mr. Quinn provided did not mention this phenomenon;
the above text seems to contradict it.  

Mr. Quinn's statement that "Its true. The human body is more than just
human cells---it a symbiosis with several other species in benign
interactions like these." is not entirely to the point.  That lots of
beasties live on us is not only true, it is rather old news as far as I
am concerned.  That mites keep our eyelashes in has had no evidence
presented in its favor, and was the idea which caused much
righteous furor.

You'd presumably have to convince other bee keepers that your bees weren't
going to breed with other bees and spread those particular engineered genes
around. Its a lot simpler keeping all your transgenic cows in the one
paddock. Just think of the hassles people have had with African bees.

*BBZZZZTTTT!!!*  Thank you for playing.


Were you there? I was. 


The bundle was only about 4 million. Nothing like the bundle spent on, for instance, the PenPoint OS. Which shipped. three versions. And died at the hands of players like AT&T and massive market indifference. I was close at hand for that, too.


The only really blue-sky part of Xanadu was cultural, not technological.

This is distinct from "handwaving". Xanadu did have that--but Silicon Valley has no shortage of either... or hadn't you noticed?


The retrenching of AutoDesk was done after John Walker left the company. John still thinks that xanalogical hypertext publishing has value--see his Web site for clues. 


ACAD is now taking a beating in their "core business". 


And the Web has between 2 and 4 terabytes of storage (according to a few estimates), and it still doesn't even have bidirectional links, for crying out loud--but "blue-sky" tech like the massively-parallel Inktome indexing engine keeps people dumb and happy. 


The Xanies had more than one blind spot. But comparing enfilades to nanotech is like comparing a new motor oil additive to controlled cost-effective matter-antimatter power.


MMB, 

who really ought to write a book about this stuff 

just to spit in the eye of the self-appointed historians of Xanadu.

I only discovered Extropy about a year ago.  The reason I consider myself
'Extro' is because my personal beliefs (which I developed early in life) are
very Extro.  The one thing about Extro and transhuman belief I have noticed,
is that it's naturally accouring, it does not have to be forced.  I would
even say, from my personal experience, that it is the 'natural' state.  Most
Extro and transhumanist beliefs revolve around survival and evolution.  The
two most natural things we do.

I have heard many people say that our evolution should be away from 'animal
behaviour', that we should rise above our natural instincts.  But evolution
itself is a natural instinct, and what is life extention if not survival
(very animalistic)!  

These Mystics you talk of sound more Extro than a lot of self-confessed
Extro's.  Hey, maybe I can call my self a Mystic now :)

        That is something I intended to point out a few days ago.  I can't
possibly agree that extropy is a belief that is adopted.  I think that it is
a part of a person that is usually unacknowledged due to the multitudes of
learned behaviour and conditioning.  Many "belief-systems" are based upon
trends and the self-satisfying feeling that the belief is socially
acceptable.  I wouldn't say that this applies to extropy.  People *are*
extropians...they, for the most part, don't just adopt futuristic and
progressive beliefs for the hell of it.  That is why many on this list are
militant against threads regarding eyelash bugs: it seems to be insulting to
us, be it intended or no.  You would be hard-pressed to find the same ideas
from your average mystic.

How can rational people expect to make good investments in a irrational
economy ?  Saying investing in nanotechnology is a good idea is like saying
you should invest in computers.  But which company ?  The company with the
best idea's and the most Extro views will not be the most successful.

If you want to make good investments you have got to get your head 'round all
those crazy ideals of (apparently) normal people!  The best technology will
win out in the end, and over long periods of time 'Extro' ideals will spread.
 However, this tells you nothing of what company to invest in.

Even if you understand the technology, do you understand the market !?

It always suprises me how unimaginative many people are.  Unfortunately,
there are a lot of people out there who, not only refuse to *believe* in new
technologies (Nanotechnology being their favorite disbelief), but don't even
relise life exists beyond their own homes.  Even more unfortunately, I seem
to be related to all of them!

Jelly, Peanut Butter (aided by worms).  Maybe assembling microelectronics
(ants could be good for this).  It may even be possible to create a
'computer-ecology'.  Birds tell you when you have mail, Infomation grows on
tree's and Rabbits act as know-bots (at this point you probably understand
why many people think the idea is 'crazy').  Certainly takes ubiquitous
computing to a strange new level.

Have you ever seen the french movie "City of Lost Children".  They have a
flea, trained to be an assasin.  There is already research into
'remote-control' cockroaches that can (theoritcally) be used for spying, etc.
 Experiments into using dolphins as weapons have been going for a long time.

I only thought of this after reading your response, but if extropian beliefs
are naturally occuring - People must be natural optimists and only learn to
be pessimists.  What a nice thought!  If only we could teach people to
unlearn their behaviour and conditioning.

Another 'nice thought' is that over time things tend to reform to their
natural states.

Ding ding ding!  Give that man a gold-plated cigar!  You have just described

All these physical effects and more will occur when two neutron stars glom
into each other and form a black hole.  It's sufficiently hard to figure out
what happens that there is no concensus how we get from the neutron stars to
the gamma rays.  There's obviously plenty of energy there to make all the
gamma rays, but understanding what happens requires simultaneous analysis of
black holes, nuclear reactions at temperatures far above experiment,
turbulence beyond current theoretical understanding, magnetic fields and
shock waves far stronger than those in any other astrophysical object, and
the very real possibility that new laws of physics come into play.  What fun!

You're saying we are freaks, locally enrichened dropout deposits,
originated by a Darwinian fluke. Can't agree more, having seen the same
phenomenon on sci.cryonics/CryoNet, where it is even more pronounced. Bad
thing this seems to correlate (anecdotal evidence) with a cranky attitude,
inability to cooperate (which is not exactly instrumental). If true, one
should be aware of this, if only to give one a mental kick in the ass.

If you watch the actually NOVA episode, they do say that the eyelash do

And, then there is the extropic element of refined emotions which, when
implemented, relieve the kick in the ass tendency.  By way of learned
self-esteem,  
while provoking one to access situations, that knee-jerk crankiness becomes
sculpted into a acquired wisdom.

So describe virtual erotica? Interactive role playing? What form would
it take? I have the contacts to set up any site that looks like a
profitmaker.

If it were done right, it would be worth ALOT of money. An
acquaintance makes $3000-$5000 per day from one website selling
amateur pictures. WWW.PERSIANKITTY.COM, the Yahoo of the adult sites,
makes in excess of $80,000 per month in ad revenue only.

By the way, I have lurked on this list for many months, this is my
first post.

IMHO it was not a great case, but a funny and interesting case. I
recommend the book, but it does not provide that much evidence for
the "universal theory"; it mainly uses the same kind of convincing
handwaving (if more cyberdelic) as is used to support other
personality models (Ericsson, Freud, Jung and other personality
psychologists). It is easy to tie together everything, the hard part
is showing that the ties actually mean something. 

I have found support of many of his observations both in my own
experience and in established psychological results; "what the
thinker thinks the prover proves" is widely recognized in cognitive
science, the anal character of territorialism is quite noticeable
(although this could be a WTTTTPP effect) and I have found plenty of
evidence for the snafu-principle of hierarchical organisations. I'm
somewhat more sceptical of the "higher circuits"; I partially buy the
concept of the fifth which I have experienced myself, but the others
need better delineations and support (and one should remember that
this system is just one possible map of the human mind).

The difference is that the benefits are less well defined.

> How can rational people expect to make good investments in
> an irrational economy?

Good question, and my personal approach is to invest in those
people--and a corporation is only as good as the people who
control it--who exhibit the most rational behavior, because it is
the rational minds of people that will overcome many of the evils
of the present system.

I invest in companies that produce quality products, that do not
do much business with the government or lobby for legislation,
that look to the next century instead of the next quarter, etc.
Since almost no company isn't without a few faults, one can
approximate this by investing in the market broadly /minus/ those
companies who commit the most heinous offenses: regulated
monopolies like utilities, military contractors, the government
itself of course (don't buy treasuries), industries that rely on
subsidies like recyclers, and industries with big lobbies.

That one's easy. You don't understand the market, you create the market.
Thus the best you can do is to invest in your own company. Don't ride the
wave. Take control, change the rules. It's hard work, it takes time, but
it's far more rewarding.

Speaking of investments. I've been surfing for information on offshore
investments and company formation, and found some meterial. I would like
to know if someone on this list has more personal ideas to share?

A question on a specific area: With the growth in the third world (where I
live...), what do you all think of stocks associated with "feminine higiene
products", specifically Tampax and similar products. Would this be an area
we could get into the right stage of the growth cycle? Also the increased
use of paper/disposable diapers might open up an opportunity, no?

I wrote Friday that I thought it would be a bad idea to invest in a startup

hypothetical.  However today I was browsing http://www.foresight.org, and
I learned that exactly such a company started up last month!

Zyvex, at http://www.zyvex.com/, is a Texas company whose mission is to
develop the first assembler.  They don't have a very clear timeline to when
they will achieve it, although I saw "5+ years" mentioned.

They aren't asking for funding on the page, but if anyone wants to ignore
my advice I'm sure you could contact the company and find out if there would
be any opportunities to participate in future funding rounds.

How about offspring? It may be that the children of alphas though fewer
in number, produce more children or have less infant mortality.

A few years ago there was a male student at UC Berkeley who attended
classes in the nude. He was eventually persuaded to put on some shorts,
not on legal grounds but on the grounds that seats he had sat in were no
longer sanitary.

As an attendee of various neopagan events which are clothing optional I
have to say that the novelty wears out very quickly. The usual reasons
for clothing - protection and self expression will continue to
apply.....

Privately, as an owner of a hot tub, it is easy to get people to disrobe
- just offer them something worthwhile, like the warm water...

Actually, Jin von Ehr made an announcement last October
at a Foresight meeting, and asked us to keep quiet for awhile.
It was a thrilling thing to hear.
What is new is an increased funding level. They intend to 
generate more publicity later this summer.

They seem to be taking stock of possible routes and interim products.

This may be, perhaps an IPO sometime, although it is
privately held at this time.

Binary neutron stars also exist in the Milky Way, perhaps as many as two

 Three such systems are tentatively identified.

I'm interested in human/machine interface technologies for the 
disabled.  One category of input devices is based on tracking eye 
movements (point of gaze).  This allows "people who cannot use their 
hands to "push buttons" with their eyes, like a visual mouse."

See THE EYEGAZE SYSTEM at http://www.lctinc.com/doc/optic.htm.

This is an interesting product, but it's a few years old, and the 
system is pricey. 

With recent advances in computing power and the new all digital 
1394 (Firewire) interface, significant cost reductions could be 
achieved, resulting in a less expensive and more accurate system 
affordable enough for mainstream use.  

It's interesting to me is that most of the design work has 
already been done.  Perhaps existing products could be licensed 
and adapted for OEM use?
 
See http://www.firewire.org/aboutta/products/sony.html.

It's interesting how many companies in the medical device industries 
a quite content selling their products at a very high price, since 
the insurance carriers pick up the bills.

Consumer PC technologies are driven prices down, but many of these 
companies are reluctant to incorporate these less expensive 
technologies into their products because it would decrease their 
profits.

One possible GENERAL strategy would be to examine the whole industry 
of medical electronics.  Then, instrument by instrument, create 
competing designs based on the latest microprocessors, PCs, & DSPs.

I imagine that many developing nations would appreciate having 
alternatives when shopping for the hardware for new hospitals.

Subject: A Fire Upon the Deep ending
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

THIS HAS SPOILERS FOR VERNOR VINGE'S NOVEL "A FIRE UPON THE DEEP".

I was pleased to see Max mention a few weeks ago that Vernor Vinge is
working on a book tentatively titled "A Deepness in the Sky".  I assume
this is related to "A Fire Upon the Deep", which is one of my favorite
SF novels.

In re-reading AFUTD though I find that the parts I liked best were the
high tech space adventures, the descriptions of future technology,
and the usenet-style galactic newsgroup postings.  I didn't really
care for the parts about the dog packs and their medieval plotting.
So it will be interesting to see what direction he goes with the new book.

One thing I didn't like about the ending to AFUTD is that it seemed so
destructive.  Readers will recall that the Countermeasure, activated by
the "godshatter" within Pham Nuwen, has altered the boundaries of the
zones of thought, pushing the Slow Zone up into what used to be the
Transcend.  This effectivelly killed the Blight since it could not
live within such conditions.

However, this also will wreak terrible destruction on the other
civilizations in that part of the galaxy, which have become dependent on
FTL communication and transportation, and possibly other technologies
that won't work in the Slow Zone.  As Vinge has a character say,
"In some ways the Revenge was a worse thing than the Blight itself."
Truly this is burning down the village in order to save it.

When I read the book the first time I had the impression that the
extension of the Slow Zone occured throughout the galaxy.  Sandor at
the Zoo, a tough and smart newsgroup poster, had speculated that the
previous incarnation of the Blight and its subsequent destruction marked
the beginning of recorded history.  This would presumably have been a
galaxy wide event, otherwise the unaffected regions would no doubt have
passed down some legends about such a dramatic occurance.

Actually Vinge leaves the magnitude of the Zone changes somewhat ambiguous.
Ravna's instruments indicate that Tines World, at the former bottom of the
Beyond, is now 1,000 to 30,000 ly deep within the Slow Zone.  The Beyond
was about 5,000 ly deep, so this would be consistent with the Slow Zone
extending far into the Transcend.

The last item in the book is a news posting from the "Society for
Rational Investigation" saying that they are getting no response from
sites to spinward.  Apparently they are right on the edge of the extended
Slow Zone.  They are also getting no response from sites in the Transcend
above the affected region, confirming that the Slow Zone does in fact
extend high enough to engulf the Powers up there.

So, the Slow Zone extends high, but how wide is the affected region?  I did
a bit of detective work to get some information.  The Society for Rational
Investigation is mentioned a couple of times earlier, and its location is
given.  Unfortunately two different numbers are used in my edition.  In
chapter 18 it is described as "Probably a single system in Middle Beyond,
5700 light-years antispinward of Sjandra Kei."  In chapter 40 the same
description is used, except the distance is 7500 ly antispinward.  So it
is around 5700-7500 ly antispinward of Sjandra Kei.  Sjandra Kei is itself
about 1500 ly spinward of Tines World, putting SRI about 4000-6000 ly
antispinward of them.

If we assume that the Zone disturbance is roughly symmetrical around Tines
World, then this suggests that the affected region is about 10,000 ly wide,
extending maybe 10,000 ly out, to include all of the inhabited part of the
Transcend above Tines World, and hopefully including all the area which
had been grabbed by the Blight.

I tried to get some information about how wide the Blight's region was.
A few High Beyond civilizations are described as under its control.
One way to judge how far these are away is by looking at the language
translation paths.  They all end up as Triskweline, apparently a widely
used language in that part of the galaxy.

Arbitration Arts is the first High Beyond civilization conquered.
Their messages are translated as Firetongue->Cloudmark->Triskweline.
However the first two are High Beyond trade languages apparently capable
of carrying high level protocol packets, something like an advanced
version of Java applets.  The Blight uses these to subvert Arbitration
Arts, and after that nobody uses the High Beyond languages any more,
they stick to the Middle Beyond ones.  So basically this civilization is
going directly to Triskweline, suggesting it is close by.  Similarly,
Sandor Arbitration Intelligence at the Zoo is another powerful High
Beyond "military corporation" which gets taken over by the Blight.
Their messages are directly in Triskweline, with no translation, again
suggesting that they are located roughly "above" Tines World.

All this is consistent with the Blight's range still being relatively
limited (on the galactic scale) at the time that the Countermeasure
was activated, so that even though the Zone disturbance was relatively
localized, it is reasonable to assume that all of the Blight was in
fact engulfed.  That's good.  There is so much death and destruction in
the novel that it would be a real tragedy if it had failed to accomplish
its purpose.

The remaining puzzle then is why the destruction of the Blight this time
is seemingly less harmful to the galaxy as a whole than the previous
incarnation.  Throughout the novel there is no hint that anyone remembers
any earlier instance of the Blight.  My guess is that in fact the previous
time the Blight was activated, its destruction required a far more
powerful defense.  Perhaps it spread much faster before a Countermeasure
could be found and activated.  After all, it was a near enough thing
this time.  Yet by Sandor's speculations, the Countermeasure would have
been widely distributed throughout the galaxy to be ready if and when
the Blight is activated again.  So even if this particular instance had
been destroyed, assuming the Low Beyond remains relatively free from the
Blight's control (perhaps something like Vichy France), someone might
eventually stumble on the Countermeasure and find out how to activate it,
or perhaps something the Blight would do would eventually trigger it.

We might assume that the activation of the Countermeasure in the novel
was finely tuned by the godshatter so that it would do no more damage
than was necessary.  Since the Blight was being destroyed relatively
early in its spread, only a limited shift of the Zonal boundaries would
be enough to eradicate it.

What this theory suggests then is that at some point in the past, the
Slow Zone was extended into the Transcend on a nearly galaxy-wide basis
in order to destroy a Blight which had conquered the galaxy, controlled
the Upper Beyond absolutely, and through agents had a great deal of
control over the rest of the Beyond.  The Countermeasure was activated,
the Zonal boundaries extended, and ever since then they have been receding
until they are at the size observed "today".

One problem with this is that the Zones are said to be shrinking at
710 m/s.  This is about 2000 ly per billion years.  So if the Slow Zone
was pushed out beyond the Transcend, it would need to shrink more like
10,000 ly to be back to where it is today, requiring 5 billion years.
But this is much longer than their history seems to go back.  Possibly the
surge is more temporary, shrinking back at a much faster rate initially,
then slowing down as the Zones approach their "natural" states.  In that
case the previous incarnation of the Blight might have happened only a
billion or two years ago.

Hope you enjoy this bit of speculation -

Subject: FREE Money Virus

There is a computer virus that is being sent across the Internet. 
If you receive an e-mail message with the subject line "Free Money,"
DO NOT read the message. DELETE it immediately, UNPLUG your computer, 
then BURN IT to ASHES in a government-approved toxic waste disposal 
INCINERATOR.

Once a computer is infected, it will be TOO LATE. Your computer will 
begin to emit a vile ODOR. Then it will secrete a foul, milky DISCHARGE. 
Verily, it shall SCREECH with the tortured, monitor-shattering
SCREAM of 1,000 hell-scorched souls, drawing unwanted attention to 
your cubicle from co-workers and supervisors alike. After violently 
ripping itself from the wall, your computer will punch through 
your office window as it STREAKS into the night, HOWLING like a 
BANSHEE. Once free, it will spend the rest of its days SODOMIZING 
household PETS and MOCKING the POPE.

Some filthy, disgusting miscreant... some no-good, low-down, good-for- 
nothing DIRTY SNAKE, in twisted pursuit of his own sadistic dreams, 
is sending this virus across the Net via an e-mail entitled "Free 
Money." What is so terrifying about this virus is that you do not 
even to have to open the e-mail for it to activate. In fact, you do 
not even need to RECEIVE the e-mail. You do not even need to OWN a 
COMPUTER. "Free Money" can infect even minor HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES.

How it does this with straight ASCII code is, frankly, a matter of 
some debate... but BELIEVE YOU US, if this weren't a SERIOUS 
situation, we wouldn't be discussing it in ALL CAPS.

So for the LOVE OF GOD, forward this e-mail to all those you claim 
to care about, all those you purport to love. Don't do it later! 
Do it NOW! Now! Now! NOW! NOW! NOW!


----------------------------------------------

NOAH AND THE GOVERNMENT.

And the Lord spoke to Noah and said:  "In six months I'm going to make it
rain until the whole earth is covered with water and all the evil people
are
destroyed.  But I want to save a few good people, and two of every kind of
living thing on the planet.  I am ordering you to build Me an Ark."
 
And in a flash of lightning he delivered the specifications for an Ark.
"OK,"
said Noah, trembling in fear and fumbling with the blueprints.
 
"Six months, and it starts to rain," thundered the Lord.  "You'd better
have
my Ark completed, or learn how to swim for a very long time."
 
And six months passed.  The skies began to cloud up and rain began to fall.
 
The Lord saw that Noah was sitting in his front yard, weeping.  And there
was
no Ark.  "Noah," shouted the Lord, "where is my Ark?"  A lightning  bolt
crashed into the ground next to Noah.
 
"Lord, please forgive me!" begged Noah.  "I did my best.  But there were
big
problems.  First I had to get a building permit for the Ark construction
project, and your plans didn't meet code.  So I had to hire an engineer to
redraw the plans.  Then I got into a big fight over whether or not the Ark
needed a fire sprinkler system.  My neighbors objected, claiming I was
violating zoning by building the Ark in my front yard, so I had to get a
variance from the city planning commission.
 
Then I had a big problem getting enough wood for the Ark because there was
a
ban on cutting trees to save the Spotted Owl.  I had to convince U.S. Fish
and Wildlife that I  needed the wood to save the owls.  But they wouldn't
let
me catch any owls.  So no owls. Then the carpenters formed a union and went
out on strike.  I had to negotiate a settlement with the National Labor
Relations Board before anyone would pick up a saw or a hammer.  Now we 
have
16 carpenters going on the boat, and still no owls.
 
Then I started  gathering up animals, and got sued by an animal rights
group.
 They objected to me taking only two of each kind.  Just when I got the
suit
dismissed, EPA notified me that I couldn't complete the Ark without filing
an
environmental impact statement on your proposed flood.  They didn't take
kindly to the idea that they had no jurisdiction over the conduct of a
Supreme Being.  Then the Army Corps of Engineers wanted a map of the
proposed
new flood plain.  I sent them a globe.
 
Right now I'm still trying to resolve a complaint from the Equal Employment
 Opportunity Commission over how many Croatians I'm supposed to hire, the
IRS
has seized all my assets claiming I'm trying to avoid paying taxes by
leaving
the country, and I just got a notice from the state about owing some kind
of
use tax.  I really don't think I can finish your Ark for at least another
five years," Noah wailed.
 
The sky began to clear.  The sun began to shine.  A rainbow arched across
the
sky.  Noah looked up and smiled.  "You mean you're not going to destroy the
earth?" Noah asked, hopefully.
 
"No," said the Lord sadly, "Government already has."

Didn't the Zones contract around Tines World just before the

in Transcend?

One thing we do know (from "The Blabber") is that Ravna is destined
to return to the Beyond, somehow.

Yes, that's always an exellent innovation strategy. If think more
or less any technology that helps a disabled person will help the
not-so-disabled person as well. (We're all disabled if we have
good enough imagination.) It's an fairly easy strategy as well, just
take a look at the existing medical niche market, then rework
the product into something that is cheap to produce and everyone
can use.

My original question was more like: If you already have the product
and the market worked out, where and how do you setup your offshore
business to achive maximum freedom and filthy richness? (ie personal
opinions)

Yes.  In particular the essential amino acid Lysine is deficient
in plant proteins.  Lysine can prevent glyco-sylation in ageing
and (IIRC) is important for strong muscles and immune function.

In talking with vegans I am always surprised that so frequently
they are unaware of this possible deficiency.  If the vegan
diet is restricted (perhaps to lose weight) lysine deficiency
is almost inevitable.  Does anyone know of any (relatively rich)
plant sources for lysine ?

 This basic idea makes sense, but it is important to base your belief
that it's a safe bet on something other than what other investors are
currently thinking, or you will generally end up buying fads. Personal
knowledge of the quality of a company's product/service/technology is
usually the right kind of approach to picking safe long-term investments.
 Your attitude towards Coca Cola sounds more like something you have
picked up from popular investment ideas rather than independent analysis.
 It may be very safe to bet that Coca Cola's earnings will continue
to grow around 18%/year, but at a price/earnings ratio of 47 I would
say that the market has already discounted 8-10 years of this kind of
growth. Most earnings forecasts more than 5 years into the future are
worthless.

 I'm unsure about the environmental effects of Coke, but anyone who
had read much Extropian writings about health would avoid drinking 
drinking high calorie, low vitamin foods such as regular Coke (the
health effects of diet Coke are less clear).

 I don't know why. I'd say Max's investment in Coca-cola is based on a
prediction of consumer demand for Coke that is unrelated to Max's
opinion of whether Coke is a good drink, and reflects a good deal of
respect for the judgements of Coke drinkers whose values probably differ
from Max's value. I'd say this is very far from narcissism. Maybe you
meant greed instead?

 If you expect Extropian investments to be motivated by altruism, you
don't understand Extropianism very well.

 There is no way to avoid making a bet when investing. All you can do is
choose between low risk and high risk bets.
 Buying an index today is a bet that todays index prices aren't inflated
by abnormal popularity of index investing. I could come up with other
bets involved with index investing, but that is probably the riskiest today.
 It is important to avoid making bets where the person you are betting against
has more info than you. If you see a company whose price looks low enough
that it's obviously a good buy, stop and think about why people are selling.
If you can't find a good reason (i.e. they bought at a better price and are
deciding it's time to diversify), assume they have knowledge of problems at
the company that you haven't found yet.

 This advice is very much true for investing in financial markets
as well. Many investors fail to distinguish between the entertainment
value they get from betting on an interesting company and the wealth
they are likely to get from investing wisely. That usually interfers
with their ability to make money.

 This concern should be taken seriously. I'd guess an S&P index fund
will underperform broader indexes by 0.5 to 1 percentage point over
the next decade.

Well, you want to set up someplace that has no income tax/capital gains
tax, but still has zero or very low tariffs for exporting to the US
market. There are several Carribean nations that fill this requirement,
like St. Kitts. Being signatory members of the Carribean Basin
Initiative, a free/almost free trade pact developed in the Reagan
administration after the Grenada conflict, many carribean island nations
have special trade priviledges under this. They are also now pressing to
become members of NAFTA.

ALso, I recommend doing your banking in a country like the Seyschelles,
an archipelago nation in the Indian Ocean. Depositing at least $2
million in a Seychellian bank makes one eligible for diplomatic status
as well as citizenship in the Seychelles. This gets you diplomatic
immunity when traveling or living in any other nation with normal
relations with the Seychelles.

In the history of "the Blabber", we see that AFUTD is in our own future
history, and even in AFUTD, we read that either Sjandra Kei, or the
planet its founding fathers came from was settled directly from Earth.
In "the Blabber", the attraction of the Blabber's world to those in the
Transcend was that it had been settled only a hundred years or more
previous by people directly from earth, only since they had been riding
a subluminous "slowboat" they had been traveling for some 35,000 years
in cold sleep at relativistic speeds, which is why they could
realistically pull off a reproduction of a 20th century Michigan port
city for the transcendant tourists.

Yes, but that region was already at the bottom of the transcend, so that
just prior to reaching the Tines world, Ravna and her pursuers hit breif
pockets of slow zone, wherever the gravity gradient was too steep.

We don't however, know when she does in relation to AFUTD. In the
Blabber, doesn't the ansible reply that the Tines interstellar empire
(that they supposedly would build AFTER AFUTD) was a thousand or more
years dead, and that the Revenge was blamed on them as an even worse
blight than The Blight.

It sounds like you are making assumptions. I chose Coca Cola because I am
reasonably familiar with the management and the major changes they made
several years ago, and because I have discussed the company with those who
know much about it and have been convinced that it has long-term growth
still ahead of it.

The same (only more so) would have been true if I had bought Microsoft,
which I certainly would have done if its stock hadn't been at an all-time
high (though still a good value). I know more about Microsoft, how it's run
and its markets, than I know about any other company. With almost any other
company, your comment would be correct -- I know too little about
practically any other company to base an investment decision on it (rather
than simply a gamble). Apart from two or three companies, my knowledge is
such that I would buy a broad index fund rather than individual company
stocks. (If I could afford it, I might make an exception for Berkshire
Hathaway, but then that would be like buying several companies....)

I am perfectly willing to tailor my investments according to my values.
Environmental health is one of those, but I don't see any environmental
problems caused by Coke (anymore than result from any form of production in
our pre-nano, only partially market-based system). As for health, which of
course is a major value to me -- especially my own -- I drink Diet Coke
sometimes, and don't believe it's harming me. Drinking a large quantity
might be bad because of the phosphoric acid (informed feedback is welcome
here), but I don't drink much. Sugary Coke shouldn't be bad for someone if
they drink it *occasionally*. That choice is up to each individual. I do
not see it as my duty to refrain from investing in Coke because some people
choose to drink five cans of sugary Coke per day.

Here's what I meant.  Imagine that everyone in the world had the same
investment portfolio, with the same relative fraction of their wealth
in each investment made anywhere.  Rich people would have more shares
of this portfolio, but otherwise everyone is the same.  In this
situation, I would say no one is making a bet, though everyone does
suffer risk regarding the performance of the world economy as a whole.

For anyone whose portfolio differs from this average portfolio, one or
more other people must hold the negative of this difference in their
portfolio.  I say two sides are making a bet; whatever one side gains
the other side loses.  Each side also now risks that the other side
has better information.

Some bets are good for insurance reasons; different people may have
different risk tolerances or different state-dependent preferences for
wealth.  Some bets are also good because they are on what people will
choose to do, and we can prefer to give people incentives to do the
right thing.  But beyond this, one side in a bet is making a mistake.

Since actual index funds are not exactly the average world investment,
they are bets regarding the difference.  But as you put together
enough indexes and approach the average, your total portfolio
approaches not making a bet.

No we don't.  Even the "The Blabber" is in the same universe "Ravna"
could easily be a descendant of the original population with the same
name.  The name of the founding mother might well be popular.  And at
any rate, I've generally figured that the short story was a prototype
for the universe, and shouldn't be shoehorned in.  I've tried, and it
doesn't fit very well.

More like _Ringworld Engineers_; a small fraction die to save the whole.
But the whole is so big the death of the fraction beggars the
imagination.  Unchecked the Blight might well have spread around the
galaxy to consume the whole High Beyond and Low Transcend (since it
seemed fairly good at killing off Powers) and who knows what after that.

Perhaps.  My take on the book, and the Skroderider legends, has been
that the natural state of the universe corresponds to what I'll call the
High Transcend, and that the entire system of the Zones is an artifact,
partly to deal with the Blight, and partly to make sure that budding
civlizations were protected in the future.  Beyond and Slow Zone as
nurseries.  This exaplains why the Blight was so good at murdering
Powers -- its previous incarnation had been in the High Transcend, so
while the current one wasn't running at full capacity it had access to
algorithms and whatnot that the Low Powers didn't, in much the same way
that skrodes couldn't be designed, tinkered with, or understood, by
Beyond intelligences.

I had the impression, from one brief mention of Andromeda(?) that the
Zonal pattern was in other galaxies as well, which would help the belief

Myself and a few others have been looking at offshore company formation for
a while now.  What type of company are you thinking of starting?  Lesser
developed nations will often waive tariffs and give large tax breaks to
high-tech companies that want to operate in their country.  I have stacks
of papers from the State Department as well as a couple overseas
governments regarding the issue of overseas company formation.  You don't
realize how easy it is to start a company in the U.S. until you try and do
it in another country.

I am hoping to get an overseas venture going within a couple years.

I think an obvious one is the software industry. The offshore company
can buy copyrights or sublicense rights and get the royalty payments.

Have you taken a look at the offshore service companies? Some offer
you an offshore starup in two days. I don't know how serious some
of them are, but if they do what they say it might be worth the money.

Thats nice (just have to get filthy rich first). I've seen some countries
offering citizenship for a $50000 government bond investment. For

An excellent example of this was posted to this list a few weeks
ago:


SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 29, 1997--Nanogen Inc. Tuesday
announced that it has been awarded a U.S. patent covering key areas
of its Automated Programmable Electronic Matrix (APEX) Technology.

U.S. Patent No. 5,605,662, titled ``Active Programmable 
Electronic Devices for Molecular Biological Analysis and
Diagnostics,''is the third U.S. patent issued to the company within
the past 10 months.
          
``This patent provides Nanogen with significant proprietary 
protection on our electronic microchip array technology,'' said 
Howard C. Birndorf, chairman and chief executive officer of
Nanogen.

 The patent, which expires on Feb. 25, 2017, was issued to 
co-inventors Michael J. Heller, Ph.D., chief technical officer and
a co-founder of Nanogen, and Eugene Tu, research scientist.  Patent
applications on this invention have also been filed
internationally. All rights to the patents have been assigned to
Nanogen.
          
``Our invention encompasses self-addressable microelectronic 
devices which can actively carry out and control multiplex
reactions in microscopic formats,'' said Heller.
          
``We are actively developing a series of products embodying this 
technology which will have applicability in a variety of areas, 
including the early detection and diagnosis of disease, genetic 
screening, molecular oncology, blood typing and screening, and 
biological research, as well as a number of other potential 
applications,'' added Tu.

 Nanogen is a privately held company focused on the development of 
a broad-based diagnostic platform, which combines molecular
genetics, microelectronics, lasers and nanotechnology.  The company
currently employs 60 people at its corporate headquarters in San
Diego.

I agree that any investment should be subjected to the cold harsh
light of good capitalism, but we should use our own expertise and
knowledge base to recognize "nuggets in the gravel."

The original assertion was not that hair folicles may be infested with

I'd like to make sure people understand there is a reasonable line to

          I consider going to the Extro3 conference, but living in 
          London there is quite a bit of journey for me to get to 
          California. It would therefore be nice if there were some 
          other interesting symposium in America at about the same 
          time (say plus minus two weeks) that one could cover on the 
          same trip. For me, it would presumably be conferences in 
          analytic philsophy, neuroscience, or some other 
          transhumanist-related gathering. Does anybody have any

          Here is a curious fact: Eunuchs live on average 13.5 years

          extension technique available to date, at least for half of 
          us...
          
          Does anybody know whether this effect is wholly due to the 
          reduced levels of activity and stress in eunuchs, or is 
          there also a more direct influence from the modified hormone 
          balance that is not behaviourally mediated. If there is, 
          might this effect be somehow reproduced without the adverse 
          effects of castration?
          
          
          On a different note, I have just launched a new web site

     I could treat this statement as a "what's so" or as a personal 
     judgment but I'll opt for the former, reminding you that in my 
     original post, I was *asking* for understanding so, if the quote was a 
     censure, it was redundant.  
     
     I would expect no human concern to be completely altruistic.  We've 
     still got the survivalist trigger somewhere in our brain that keeps 
     narcissism at the forefront of our consciousness.  However, if 
     humanity were in a life raft adrift at sea, I'd hope that an Extropian 
     would be the person most adept at navigating, protecting from the 
     elements, and rationing the food and water.  S/he would be the leader 
     that would better assure the survival of the group because of a 
     natural tendency toward leadership, optimism and use of resources.  
     
     And yes, I think it's quite opportunistic to invest in something that 
     makes money for you and is not benefiting and could be harmful to 
     society.  I've drank gallons of it over my life probably, it goes 
     great with pizza.  Now, I consider it a treat.  But many people guzzle 
     it like water.  After the smoke has cleared and our society has agreed 
     upon the scourge of smoking and it becomes the habit of only the 
     weakest and feeble-minded, we will move our focus to the next and 
     probably more important level in collective health consciousness: junk 
     food.  There is a tie between what we eat as a culture and how we 
     behave.  Garbage in, garbage out.
     
     Right now, the soft drink companies (as well as the tobacco) companies 
     are establishing international markets with people who are delighted 
     to have their products but are totally oblivious to the consequences, 
     health wise and environment wise as well (can you imagine all of China 
     with Coke with dispensed ice in plastic/paper cups?)
     
     So, no, altruism need not be the primary goal of an Extropian way of 
     thinking but it certainly should be pressing on the minds of those 
     that are claiming a post human destiny and it should show up in their 
     lifestyle.  You don't evolve just one part of your existence, you 
     evolve the whole thing: mind, body and spirit.  If Extropians have no 
     concern of the latter, it's an incomplete and imbalanced philosophy 
     and I should continue my search for a more full-spectrumed approach to 
     conscious, biological and social evolution.

Dear Webmaster,

NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT!

Hi, my name is Mike Mathiesen.  I wrote the book, "Marketing on the Internet", so please believe what I'm going to tell you.  You may be making money from your website, but you could be making TEN TIMES as much if you join my network-marketing opportunity I'm going to tell you about here.

1st, I DISCOVERED THIS SECRET after years of ONLINE research.  You have to ask yourself, "What is it that people coming to your website want and need more than anything else?"  The answer I discovered is: they want BETTER, MORE RELIABLE Internet Access and they want to EARN MONTHLY ROYALTIES by referring their friends, because they know that the Internet going to be in EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN THE WORLD. 

That's why I started Internet Access for Webmasters like you.  You can make more money than you dreamed possible, simply by putting up a link from your WebSite to ours.  When they switch their Internet Provider to us, we PAY YOU a handsome royalty forever.  You, in fact, have a chance to earn tens of thousands of dollars simply because you're a website owner.  And later, as you get to know me, you'll find that I have dozens more ways for you to make EVEN BIGGER rewards.  

We're the largest Internet Access Provider who also usess NETWORK-MARKETING as their main marketing plan.  Just get a few people per month from your website and they'll in turn get a few of their friends, and so on, until you have thousands in your downline.  It's already happening to many of us in the company.  We launched just a couple months ago, and already have over 2,000 members.

I asked Vinge about this a few years ago, and he confirmed that it had been
his intention that the zones were artificial, created by something that is
to the Powers as the Powers are to us.  He added that there is nothing in
the book that depends on this assumption-- it was just one of those

Siggraph 97, the ACM conference on Computer Graphics, takes place the

     Aspartame was discovered in l965 by Searle chemist, Jim
     Schlatter.  He was developing this drug for another use and after
     accidentally licking his finger found that aspartame was sweet.  Today
     aspartame is consumed by more than 100 million people in the United
     States.  This chemical (aspartame) has been approved by the Food and 
     Drug Administration (FDA) who said that an individual can safely 
     consume 97 packets of aspartame every day.  Aspartame is in many 
     products including some that children use such as diet soda, light 
     yogurt, Flintstone Vitamins, baked goods, puddings, and Winterfresh 
     gum.  It has been known to cause headaches, nausea, vision problems, 
     seizures and cancer in its users.  
     
     The ingredients in aspartame are aspartic acid, phenylalanine, and 
     methyl alcohol.  Methyl alcohol is a chemical that breaks down in high
     temperatures and turns into formaldehyde and DKP (diketopiperazine), 
     two chemicals known to cause problems in the nervous system.  
     Aspartame's life is 262 days at 77 degrees Fahrenheit, or 25 degrees 
     Celsius.  The FDA gets more complaints about aspartame than any other 
     food or drink.  The symptoms of aspartame are a lot like the symptoms 
     of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.  Ever since aspartame 
     was approved in l985, there has been an increase in brain tumors.  
     There is no direct proof that aspartame caused the brain tumors, but 
     there is enough reason to suspect that, and the television show, "60 
     Minutes" recently did a report linking the increase in brain cancer to 
     aspartame use.  
     
     The FDA reviewed Searle's studies of this artificial sweetener in 
     which rats were fed aspartame daily with their meals for one year.  
     There were 12 brain tumors in the 320 rats that were fed aspartame and 
     no brain tumors in the 120 rats that were not fed aspartame.
     
     There was also a study done at the University of Wisconsin on rhesus
     monkeys.  they were fed aspartame daily.  After  day 200 of a one year
     study the monkeys developed epileptic seizures.  After the study 
     ended,the aspartame was discontinued and the monkeys were fully 
     watched for 60 days.  The monkeys had no more seizures.
     
     The aspartame contained in diet soda stored over time can break down 
     into formaldehyde and DKP, two very dangerous poisons.  Taste tests 
     revealed a noticeable difference among tasters.  The higher the heat 
     of storage, the
     worse the taste.
     
     Diet soda stored for ten weeks loses flavor.  Aspartame in that soda
     breaks down into two products, formaldehyde and DKP.  The warmer the
     temperature, the greater the loss of aspartame and the greater the
     increase in DKP.
     
     Temperature creates two effects.  First, the higher the temperature of
     storage, the higher the level of DKP in the soda.  Second, room
     temperature seems to create the highest levels of formaldehyde in 
     soda. At very high temperatures, the formaldehyde breaks down.  
     However, even stored in a refrigerator at cold temperature, the 
     aspartame breaks down into formaldehyde. 
     
     After diet soda containing aspartame is purchased it should not be 
     stored in the heat or under any condition for a long  period of time.  
     
     
     Max continues:
     
     "Sugary Coke shouldn't be bad for someone if they drink it 
     *occasionally*. That choice is up to each individual. I do not see it 
     as my duty to refrain from investing in Coke because some people
     choose to drink five cans of sugary Coke per day."
     
     Response:
     
     As I indicated in an earlier post, I probably spent half of my life 
     mindlessly guzzling and munching on sugar water and partially 
     hydrogenated empty calorie "food".  I'm a lot more in moderation now 
     that I have a mindful attenuation to my body but I'd no sooner invest 
     in Coke, McDonalds or Frito Lay than I would in Phillip Morris, whose 
     products were made available to and shorted the lives of millions of 
     information-deprived and less educated people both here and abroad.  
     
     Yes, humans make their own decisions as I am profoundly aware with the 
     loss of both my parents this year to lung-related illness due to 
     smoking.  But some humans are less capable of others of making sound 
     decisions and that factor must be considered before one shrugs off 
     consequences.  It is no different than one attaining more profound 
     awareness wherein they take on Extropian characteristics.  Some may be 
     instinctively that way, others must be patiently coached.  
     
     If someone drinks their way to obesity or diabetes, the subtle 
     rippling effect of that dis-ease manifests in the community, in the 
     culture. Might not the extropian aim be not so much altruistic as 
     quintessentially noble?

This idea is mentioned in the book as a speculation by the characters,
and Pham Nuwen says something of the sort as the Zonal surge is activated
by Countermeasure.  "It was designed by something beyond the Powers.
Maybe there are Cloud People, maybe this is signalling them.  Or maybe
what it's done is like an insect bite, something that will cause a much
greater reaction....  Oh, the ghost of Old One is amused.  Seeing beyond
the Powers was almost worth dying for."

As far as the Zones being there to protect other races from the Powers,
I have a couple of problems with the idea.  First, one suggestion is that
the primary purpose is to protect hypothetical intelligent gas clouds
in the galactic core (the "Cloud People" in Nuwen's statement above).
No explanation is given for why anyone would believe in the existence of
these intelligent clouds.  Presumably no probes, automated or manned,
could penetrate to the core and return.  Also, how could such clouds
exist when all other forms of intelligence, machine or organic, are
suppressed by the Unthinking Depths?  (Of course this gets into the
implausibility of Zones putting a cap on intelligence or technology,
which as far as I'm concerned is just the one impossibility we have to
swallow to enjoy the story.)

If the purpose of the Zones is instead to limit the Powers to the
Transcend and leave most of the galaxy to lesser races, it seems
like overkill.  Most of the interesting stuff goes on in the Beyond.
The Slow Zone, which encompasses much of the galaxy where thinking can
occur, allows only a limited standard of living to its inhabitants.

If I were setting it up, I'd let the Beyond go all the way down to
the core.  The Slow Zone seems like protection enough for any gas
clouds.  Unimpressive "empires" like the Qeng Ho, with their ramscoops
and generation ships, offer little enough threat.  And the deep Beyond
should be relatively safe from the depradations of the Powers, while
still allowing convenient interstellar travel and communication.

Oh, well.  Someday I'll have a galaxy of my own to experiment with.  Then
you'll see it done right...

I understand what you are saying, although Siggraph puts on a pretty good
exhibition of electronic art.  I've attended a number of the conferences,
and I really enjoy viewing the latest digital imaging which gives an added

This is a real effect, but let's put the blame where it belongs: on
government regulation, not private insurance.  I have worked in the
medical insurance business and have family who still does.  Nothing
would please them more than to be able to give incentives to medical
device makers to reduce their costs; but so long as "Medicare will
pay X", they have no clout.

A private insurance company would have every reason to embrace,
even subsidize, research on cheaper devices and methods, and would
likely require their use by its subscribers.  The reason they
don't is that industry standards are set by Medicare and other
regulatory agencies with no financial incentive to be efficient.
The government operates under the myth that there is such a thing
as "enough" health care or "sufficient" care, and takes it upon
itself to define that concept, which is completely at odds with
rational economics. 

On top of that there is the government interference in the form
of patent law, which grants monopolies by fiat to manufacturers
of devices that might otherwise have to compete in the free
market withother craftsmen.

In a free society, health care would be no different from any
other technology product, and the market would drive its prices
down and its quality up just as it does so well for less regulated
markets like computers.

I think its got a parliament and a president for life or some such. They
seem to be rather benign and low key. I haven't heard about anything
negative politically happening there in decades... The cool thing is
that once you spend a minimum time there, like 6 months, you're
resident, and can spend the majority of your time thereafter elsewhere.
This is about as close as you can get to legally recognised individual
sovreignty without getting your house burned down by the FBI.

The most natural topology for MD and lattice inspired runs is a
lattice/grid. The development has swung full circle: after the demise of
the venerable British transputer we now have diverse SuperDSPs with links,
noticeable numerical performance and lots of on-die core. 

Consider the Analog Devices SHARC: a $100 chip in large quantities. It is
a 40 MIPS/120 MFLOPS, 1-4 MBIT on-die dual-ported SRAM 6 high-speed links
DSP. COAST SRAM modules have dropped down in price sufficiently that a
node can easily feature few MByte SRAM with 12-15 ns latency. TI's new
SuperDSP offers 1.2-1.6 GOPS performance, and 1 MBit core on-die, though
the first family member does not feature any high-speed links. 

A 64-node superDSP cluster, assuming $200/node would fit in a mini tower
cabinet, and offer a _dedicated_ performance rivalling that of many
supercomputers for just 13 k$; make it 15 k$ for a Linux box to do I/O and
visualization. In case of a SHARC 64-node cluster we'd get 7 GFLOPS, a TI
would peak at 70 BOPS (!), making the latter's lack of an FPU negligeable
(one can do plenty of scientific things with scaled integers).  This
numerical performance is a lot for 15 k$ -- and it's available for a
single user, for months if this needs be. 

This stuff won't run UNIX, but there are now several DSP OSses around, 
and message-passing code should be easy enough to isolate to make porting 
to other platforms easy. You see, I am obviously very excited about this.

Now a question: is anyone already doing modeling on such beasties? If no,
is anyone going to? Is anyone aware of cheap multi-DSP cards for ISA/PCI
bus, coming with documentation and a compiler? I will search on the web,
however I'd like to first sample experiences of people who already worked 
with above boards. 

Please answer, I will summarize to the lists.

Hi there
Lots of talk about index funds.
The S&P 500 will crash through the floor in a nano-replicator world.
Other than land, rare art work etc, what will hold relative value and
probably skyrocket?
I suggest platinum.
Page 433 of Nanosystems says that Platinum(Palladium is even harder to 
buy) group metals will be used as catalysts in mechanochemical processes.
1 kilo of Pt will process 10^10 kg but that is at 10^4 cycles/sec, mature 
 nano might operate at 10^6 or faster.
There are only 3.3 million oz mined each yr, 2.7 mil from South Africa.

(Don't buy the South African platinum mining ADRs, they will bail on
them in a nano-world, national wealth at stake, diamonds worthless,
gold useless - if you are an extropian who owns gold coins instead
of platinum, dump em.)

NYMEX platinum contracts are relatively illiquid.
TOKOM contracts in Japan are more liquid, however, they may block 
delivery to foreigners, again for national interests.
I suggest Canadian Maple Leaf or Australian Koala coins. Possibly 1-10 oz
wafers, check the premium.
Email me if you want to know where to buy them.
Even if an nano-replicator needs only 1/100 of an oz, (I don't know
how much is needed, it might take an oz or more), no one will sell it to 
you.
I can foresee a nano-world where transactions are paid for by
platinum coated diamondoid cards.

I know Eugene, Anders and others will say:
There is a cubic kilometer of platinum in the asteroid belt(wild guess).

But it is there, not here. And who owns that, btw? Is it the first one to
attach a probe to an asteroid owns it? What are the laws? Is it companies 
or nations or individuals who can claim asteroid ownership?
Or are the asteroids the property of all Terran citizens, pro-rata?
Experts, please.

Wars could easily erupt as South Africa and Russia completely forbid
platinum or palladium sales. Invading nano mining probes could scoop
the metal out of the mines, then full-scale nano war erupts plus maybe 
nukes.

The S&P500 or Russell 5000 will probably average 12% (dividends 
reinvested) over the next 24 yrs. That will give you $16 for each $1
invested, ignoring taxes.
It is now 2021. You can buy a nano food replicator, the design may
be free if you trade some platinum. Stick a Coke in, disassemble,
reassemble, Coke is free. Coke stock value near zero.
Analyze the Dow stocks. Who is going to eat at Mcdonalds for $10
(3% inflation) when you can eat filet mignon, lobster etc for free? Stock 
price near zero.
(Some Big Mac diehards, who, of course, will stick the food in their
replicators)

Restaurants will charge for service, ambience etc.

Boeing will be very worried about maglev, above and below ground.
Price of planes manufactured from diamondoid, etc, should crash. Stock 
way down.

You can do the rest yourself.

Wealthy Extropians buy a couple ozs, it won't break you, and you can
thank me later.
Eugene and other currently financially deprived extropians like me, 1 oz
should be ok for now.

I think many extropians would agree with me that an altruistic way of
behaving can be based on ultimately selfish (i.e. seeking to maximize
personal utility) motivations (c.f. the results of the Iterated
Prisoner's Dilemma), at least under some circumstances.

It is interesting to speculate that believing in altruism is an
evolved trait (most likely memetic rather than genetic) to simplify
our thinking about how to act. I wonder what kind of simplifications
we can evolve above/based on it?

        Indeed.  When people claim to be altruists or push the values of
altruism I am immediately suspicious.  The first thing I question is their
reasoning for unencumbered benevolence...nine times out of ten, they will be
doing it to make themselves look better.  Same with charity, same with
sacrifice.  People tend to find solace in doing what is "socially
acceptable" like giving money to the poor or donating blood.  Often the
reasons aren't because they sincerely want the poor man to have a coffee, or
to add to the diminishing blood bank, but to glorify themselves for what
they are doing.  They try to make themselves heroes of a sort.

The March 3 1997 issue of Fortune carried a survey (based on 13,000
responses) of the Most Admired Companies. This was broken down into eight
attributes of reputation. One of the categories: Community and
Environmental Responsibility. Guess who ranked number 1? Coca-Cola.

[Aside to Peter McCluskey: Coke also ranked no.1 in the category Value as a
Long-Term Investment. This information had nothing to do with my choice,
which I made before seeing that result, but adds to my confidence in my
analysis of the company's prospects.]

Somehow this does not convince me at all. TV shows frequently produce
reports that aim at ratings more than truth.
     
Regarding the studies you mention, I appreciate your information, but must
point out that it shows nothing. You omitted information essential to any
rational assessment of the studies. Practically any substance will induce
tumors or other problems in sufficient doses. You said nothing about the
doses or whether the animals respond to aspartame in the same way as
humans. This would certainly not be the first time that claims of health
problems have been based on bad science. Remember the Alar scare?

I do not claim that you're wrong about aspartame. Just that you have not
given adequate reason to accept your claims.

I do not choose to be paternalistic to that degree. People need to learn to
make responsible choices. I will not avoid investments because some people
will abuse the product of the company. My choices here reflect a spectrum
and I cannot draw a sharp line: there are companies and industries that I
will not invest in because the product is, according to my assessment, just
too easily abused. I will not invest in a tobacco company, even though I
grant that smoking two or three cigarettes per day probably does you no
harm. While my mother for many years smoked exactly one cigaretter per day
(two on Christmas Day and her birthday) I know that few people restrain
themselves. I prefer to seek profit from investments that do not have such
negative health effects (especially since I loathe cigarrette smoke and
give some credence to studies showing the effects of secondhand smoke).

On the issue of values, I will also note that my investment priorities will
vary depending on my circumstances. When I am wealthy, I may be even more
strict about refusing to invest in companies that have less extropic
effects than I'd like. I will be willing to take a lower return in order to
invest in the most extropic companies. However, the less my wealth, the
more flexible (within limits noted above) I  will be in order to get a
higher return. A very high priority for me is to secure my financial
position. I consider this a highly extropic thing to do.

Although I disagree with your critique of my investment choice, I
appreciate your raising the issue. I agree completely that investment
decisions should reflect our values. However, my assessment of the facts,
and probably also my values, differ from yours.

Onward!

I need tips on unsubscribing temporarily.  I am going on vacation.  Can
someone give me this Listserv's address and the command for leaving.

Thanks,

 I see your point now, and it is a reasonable goal for the average
investor, but index funds as they exist today aren't trying to track
an average person's investments. They're trying to track the average
stock and/or bond portfolio. It isn't as easy for the average person
to emulate an average investment in a home.

Too bad there isn't a pressure gradient between Germany and Sweden,

The question whether one should or should not invest in nano
startups has recently come up. Since I lack any information on
specific startups (I would be very thankful if any insider could
reveal some details on any of them, as there seem to be at least
two {{I haven't managed to visit their web site yet}}) and have
no financial expertise whatsoever, nor yet significant means to
invest, I'd like to offer some tentative thoughts on the status
quo, and a possible future developments in molecular
manufacturing (whether vanilla or maracuja) instead.

First of all I'd like to point out the fact that Drexler's brand
of molecular manufacturing is not an absolute prerequisite for a
transhumanist future, though it would certainly come more than
handy. (Expect me to dance through streets, while drinking
expensive liquour, throwing (for no particular reason, allow to
me to introduce the charming neologism "bazooka barfing",
relatively recently invented on the infamous pigdog list)
confetti and hollering "Vivat Drexler!" at the top of my voice
the day a rigorous study will show that nanoagent
autoreplication by means of mechanosynthesis (aka machine-phase
chemistry) is indeed feasible <a long, hard knock on wood>). The
only really big minus to this is apparent impossibility of
gradual, nondiscontinuous uploading, or nanoresurrection
(verbatim re-incarnation) of corpsicles, nee cryosuspended
patients. Personally, I think believing into nanoresurrection in
the flesh to be quite silly, since both overestimating
operational constraints drextech is subject to, and furthermore
assuming an profoundly anthropocentric view of the future. The
desuspended ones might be in for quite a shock, far beyond of
what Alcor's mildly futuristic O'Neill space colonies featuring
brochure has to offer.

The discussions on this and several other lists had led to the
following alternative future scenarios so far (please point out
these I failed to mention):

1) The >Web, a near-future noosphere matrix which leads
   to a technological Singularity, or even Transcension
   (surely, these two have earned their CAPS initials)
   by technologies unimaginable to us-current. This is
   the most conservative route, since involving merely
   enhanced cooperation of human and nonhuman agents
   and intelligence augmentation by means of delegation
   of duties (bureaucracy++) to extracorporal gadgets and
   agentry, operated by radical GUIs (HMDs, speech and
   optical input, Brain-Actuated Control (BAC) and trivial
   neuro emplants for virtual motorics).

2) Creation and inexpensive duplication of infoprocessing
   systems of human equivalent or better, resulting in a
   progressive enhanced design runaway. Brittle, inference
   engine - typed AI has shown to be useful enough to be
   commercially feasible, yet is falling remarkably far of
   these goals. GA-driven connectionist paradigm, and a
   dedicated nonalgorithmic hardware (EHW) seem to make
   up a much more explosive brew. The >H ALife Golem rears
   its multidimensional, fractally rendered posthumanist head.

3) Space-located (macroscopic) autoreplicators (initially
   designed and deployed for extraterrestrial industry
   purposes) subjected to darwinian fitness pressure will
   evolve into artificial life forms, deep space and high
   luminance/hard vacuum being their natural habitat, letting
   their meek engineered origins far behind (even forgetting us,
   though future machines should be able of being sentimental).

The points 2) and 3) are best termed the "Mind Children"
scenario.

The turmoils accompanying above possible phase transitions might
be considerable, involving even destruction of all life on earth
(uneasily, one ponders diverse Great Filters, GRBs, and
whatnots), whether as the result of a military conflict, or the
equivalent of industrial or research accidents. (You see,
obviously my European origins demand their toll, requiring at
least a single dark apocalyptic stone in the otherwise uniformly
gaudy whirl of the transhumanist mosaic).

Probabilistically, the participants of this list are unlikely to
effect measurable impacts upon these future developments. Even
worse, I still think careful mentation, idea gestation and
long-winded, good-humoured mutual bickering on diverse mailing
lists and (goodheavensforbid) usenet newsgroups are essentially
incompatible with accomplishing any of these things we so like
to talk about. (We the cheerleaders, not the sweating crew out
in the field. I'd be delighted to be proven wrong, though.
Anyway, even spectator status has got its intrinsic benefits).

Apart from having a good time, and a faint chance of actually
contributing to the global transhumanist memefection conspiracy
(tee-hee), my strictly personal life heuristic is thus to
maneuvre oneself into a position of surviving the transition
imminent (it'd better), possibly even profiting by it. Somehow I
surmise am not alone in this ;)

But back to nano (though this is by now sure facultative, being
a rant (as if nobody already noticed)). Prior to Drexler, I
guess even before R. Feynman's famed table talk "There is plenty
of room at the bottom" (funny, remember SciAm's faux pas of
using "Cargo Cult Science", Feynman's term for pseudoscientfic
gobbledygook in their more than slightly dimwit Drexler
critique, a course they by now have retracted, due to one single
NASA Ames publication) there was already much mentation about
methods for building artificial molecular-scale objects. I seem
to recall reading several papers from start to mid-80's during
my high school time. I also remember leafing through an
assistant professor's (who has spent some of his time in St.
Anford) "Nanosystems" preprint, which we at that time both found
quite ridiculous. After having bought "Nanosystems" and reread
it severeal times I now tend it to be much less laughable (this
probably being attributed to me being out of the academy for
sufficient time to lose all remaining scientific perspective
traces).

Drexler's "Nanosystems" is a pretty unpalatable piece of
literature even for an interdisciplinary reader. Constructive
engineering approach applied to molecular-scaled machines of
complexity far transcending anything the art of molecular
synthesis may ever accomplish and what computational chemists
may ever hope to model is a hard thing to swallow.

We are in a curious position today: the inexpensive computing
power currently available to us has far outstripped our
capability to do useful things with them. Quite obviously we
haven't been able to keep up with the way our tools have grown.
Our tools are not sufficiently autonomous and smart yet to aid
us in their use. The year this changes will make us stumble a
yet another major step up to the Singularity.

The average chemist uses his computer to write papers, do his
mail, and to process spectra. Period. The awareness for the
gargantuan potential slumbering in computational chemistry seems
simply to be nonexistant in most faculties. I remeber once
shaking my head incredulously at the reactions of the
(grey-haired) academic staff at my old alma mater, when a vacant
professor slot had to be filled, several years ago. A guy with a
very good reputation (at least I have heard of him) came up,
made a firework display of sophisticated concepts (GA synthetic
route planning, combinatorial chemistry, modeling, and whatnot)
and even made a whopping hands-on demo on an SGI workstation
hooked to a beamer (he brought the machine, the beamer was
hitherto regarded as just a piece of expensive furniture). I
mean this guy was really hot, he was actually doing things I
merely used to dream about at the time.

What happened? The profs stood up to fire their verbal torpedoes
at him (to sink him, they thought). Instead, they demonstrated
their very profound ignorance. They had only understood about
10% of his lecture, and were even clueless about the future
potential of those 10%. This was conservativism running rampant,
an aged alphas' throng joined last stand. I still get upset when
I think of that day.

Outside the academy, the demand for computational chemistry
comes from basically two fields: material science, and pharma.
As antisense and receptor docking medicaments have arrived in
the arsenal of modern iatro, and pharma is a big growt business,
since the age histogram of industrialized countries is getting
progressively skewed towards higher age.

There are several companies writing computer chemistry codes,
both quantum and classical level. Since handling this software
is not trivial, and assumes quite a background in classical
chemistry, I'd think consulting in such regions could bring in
quite a wad of cash. As now supercomputer-class machines made
from off-shelf consumer components (Beowulf and SHARC-based
desktop supercomputers {{I have found out there are several of
them, but the companies making them apparently expect customers
to pay a lot for added value -- btw newest SHARC with 1 MBit
on-die core, six links 120 MFlops peak, about 80 MFlops
sustainable sells for $55 in OEM quantities, and
indepedant benchmarks of TI's TMX320C6201 seem to indicate it
really to be almost one order of magnitude better than
SHARCs, though I still find its lack of links quite appaling}})
are available, a nano startup could use proprietary code,
running on in-house brewed hardware, whether Beowulf- or DSP
box flavoured, and thus skim off a larger percentile of the
cream.

Any startup setting out to build Drexler's assemblers as their
primarily, and sole goal is going to be broke surprisingly soon.

But if this company starts doing business in normal modeling
consulting, slowly building up competence and resources to
embark on bootstrap projects towards molecular manufacturing,
this company might be a quite good investment. (The best
investment would be obviously to start up just such a company).

I think you left out my favorite now shock area: biotechnology. It is
already making a lot of headway, and while people in general are
horrified by distractions like Dolly and genetically engineered soya
the field rushes on in Mach 3. Hugo is producing discoveries like a
fleet of Voyager probes (ever noticed how pre-Voyager pictures of the
solar system now look quaintly antique?), people are making cells do
fascinating tricks (grow in patterns, produce tissues and substances
we want etc) and we are getting better and better at understanding
the "logic" of life. Guess where I would bet nanotech and other >H
goodies will appear? Even if they doesn't it is an useful field, and
probably worth looking into, although so far the huge profits
predicted has not panned out. It reminds me of the debate books about
the information society I read as a child in the 70's; many of them
got a lot of things *right*, but since not much happened in the 80's
people forgot about it until it suddenly knocked down their doors. 
Biotechnology may do the same.

It is also a quite hot area to invest in. My guess is to look for
tools for *knowledge management*, we are getting better at
information management but we need more knowledge tools.

Not as imminent IMHo as your 1) and 2) (or my biotech), since it
supposes a working space industry. Right now the sky is looking
brighter, but  I doubt we will see a space boom anytime soon. Too
bad, I want to be off this rock ASAP.

Yes, this is important. It is safer to be useful and productive than
merely supporting. And learning to become very flexible is always a
good way to improve survival.

Very true. In some sense HCI is one of the most important fields for
our future evolution. Judging from its current state (metaphors vs.
direct manipulation, 2D and 3D GUIs) we need some more geniuses here
(hmm, I wonder if there is some signal substance that can be used to
attract geniuses to a field? Spread it, and they come flying).

The baby boomers will soon be demanding life extension.

Subject: w00f: PGP approved for export

=09=09PGP crypto approved for
                export=20
                By Tim Clark and Alex Lash
                May 28, 1997, 7 p.m. PT=20

                The U.S. government has granted an encryption
                export license to one of the biggest thorns in its
                side.=20

                Pretty Good Privacy says it has won approval to
                export strong encryption technology overseas. The
                license allows PGP to export technology up to 128
                bits; the government's regular licenses only allow up
                to 56 bits. To date, the government has approved
                only 128-bit encryption exports for technology that
                protects financial transactions, but PGP technology
                can encrypt any kind of digital communication.=20

                PGP's founder, cryptographer Phil Zimmermann,
                became something of a cause celebre when he
                posted his PGP software on the Net in defiance of
                laws prohibiting international distribution of
                encryption technology. Zimmermann came close to
                going to jail before the government dropped its
                case.=20

                The company said tonight that more than half of
                Fortune 100 companies use its email software.=20

                PGP still has another old foe to worry about.
                Encryption software giant RSA Data Security
                earlier this month filed a patent infringement lawsuit
                against PGP.=20

                The suit alleged that PGP is unlawfully using RSA
                technology licensed to Lemcom before its merger
                with PGP in 1996. PGP officials say RSA's claims
                are without merit.=20

Some companies have pre-existing corporations that can be purchased.
They create companies in havens like Nevis or Belize, complete with
business bank accounts, and then sell them to people. It theoretically
is possible to "set up" a company in 24 hours by buying one of these.

I view participating in this list as a hobby.  My first priority is raising
my kids.  My second priority is being nice to my wife.  My third priority is
using artificial intelligence to (voluntarily) separate people from their
money, which then flows to my corporate masters.  Making the world more
transhuman is somewhere around twelfth priority, just below keeping the yard
nice.

I suspect my job, though not directly aimed at making people more godlike,
has a greater positive effect on the future of humanity than all my posting
to this list.  At least I'm making machines a little smarter and the economy
a little more efficient.

I've been doing alot of reading on offshore entities lately. St.
Kitts/Nevis is an excellent choice, especially if anonymity is the
goal. Nevis corporations can be run by a Managing Director with all
shares of ownership being Bearer Shares. Your name shows up nowhere.

An offshore structure would probably include several countries,
leveraging each for their unique tax benefits. My personal goal is to
live on the Island of Anguilla. No income tax, low cost of living, and
a true paradise, year round.

Belize is another. I believe you can get Belizean citizenship (albeit
no diplomatic status) for a much smaller fee. $50,000US comes to mind.

This is a subject I've been wanting to bring up here for some time.
The concept of PT or Perpetual Traveler is very Extropian to me. In
essence, you are never in one country long enough to be under it's
jurisdiction. This doesnt mean skulking from country to country every
week, but essentially it involves a way to structure your life so that
you have complete freedom to do what you please with your money.
That's a terrible description, but you get the essence.

Which brings me to an aside. Why do we need, as Extropians who embrace
Intelligent Technology, a physical presence anywhere today? You can
bank by Web (http://www.sfnb.com, 100% online, highly recommended),
email by web (As you can see by my temporary rocketmail.com account)
and even get Fax and Voicemail on the Web. http://www.jfax.com is a
service that for about $30/mo you get two phone numbers in a city of
your choice (There's 22, ranging from New York and L.A., to Amsterdam,
London, Paris, and Vancouver. Frankfurt, Miami, Washington, Hong Kong,
Tel Aviv, Beirut, Bombay are on their way) These numbers accept fax
and voicemail, which are then made availible on the Web. I can (and
do) shop on the web, (www.amazon.com, www.isn.com, www.cdnow.com, ad
nauseum, ad infinitum).

So all I need, anywhere in the world, is a web browser. I've read (and
sent) email standing in the middle of Circuit City playing on a demo
WebTV through rocketmail or hotmail. The new WIRED magazine talks of
Cyber Cafe's in Beijing, where you can web for about $2/hr US.

With a proper structure of offshore companies and trusts, I can run
most of my life from anywhere in the world.

Leadership is not Altruism. Helping others is not Altruism. Charity is
not Altruism. Altruism is self-sacrifice. Altruism would be if an
Extropian were to stay on that sinking ship, to make room for humanity
on that life raft. At the extreme, It is pressure to "Do the right
thing for the good of society." Saving the world isnt any good to me
if I'm not around to see it. Read "Atlas Shrugged". That's Altruism
taken to the extreme.

Is coke bad? surely. Is diet coke bad? I feel so. Although I wont open
the "Aspartame is bad" Jihad here. Does that make Coca-Cola a bad
investment? I dont think so. Where does Social Responsibility become
Altruism? Would I invest in "We sell crack to kids, Inc."? No way.
R.J. Reynolds? Nope. Anheuser-Busch? Questionable, but maybe. From
there it gets cloudy. How about McDonalds? They sell fat-laden burgers
that are bad for you. Lamborghini? Their cars invite fast, unsafe
driving. Mead? They cut down lots of trees to make paper. Maybelline?
Animal testing. Viacom? They own MTV which plays Ganster Rap which is
bad for kids. Wal-Mart? They sell firearms, and the aforementioned
Coke, and beer, and cigarettes.

I wish you well in your search. I reject the concept of Spirit, if it
was offered with a Religious or "Soul" or Karma definition. If, on the
other hand, you use my definition of 'Spirit' which is the inherent
inalienable power of a human being to choose and plot their own
destiny, to make conscious and informed choices to seek out happiness,
then I am more comfortable. Can I imagine China with coke in paper
cups? Easier than I can tolerate a China being told, "We wont sell you
this, we know what's good for you." You say altruism need not be a
goal of extropianism. We must have different definitions. My
definition, and I'd wager the definition used by most extropians, is
the one offered up by Ayn Rand. Altruism is self-sacrifice. Altruism
is bad. Charity? Social-conscious? perhaps. My comments above speak to
this.

The farthest I can distill the concept down, at least my
interpretation of Extropianism and it's views on Objectivist
philosophy, is that Man is his own end, and his own justification. I
cannot and will not define myself against some altruistic, sociopathic
ideal to which I cannot obtain.

It's so funny: while most humans are against cloning their physical bodies,
they find nothing wrong - and even encourage - cloning of their ideas,
value system, mindsets, etc., such as religious teachings, standardized
textbooks and languages, political consensus-building, or computers.
Even the arguments against biological cloning are not aimed against
repetition, they are trying to preserve the status quo.  I am sure
the protesters against cloning would equally oppose artificial genetic
variations of any kind, even though their effect would be opposite to
cloning.
  It is exactly these people who make me feel that I live in a land
of cloned mundanes; they have reasonably varied body shapes, but
frightingly similar collections of off-the-shelf motivations and
interests.
  If I ever decide to raise one more child, I think I'd rather raise
a clone of myself.  I would know him in advance much better than any
other child, and would be able to provide him with support, environment,
education and personal opportunities that I dreamed about so much when I
was young but never received - thus assuring, by the way, that he would
grow up much more different from me than the conservative people's
children are [intended to be] from their parents.   Maybe, that's why
they wouldn't let me do it?
 
  There are, of course, "natural clones" - the twins.  I do not know
what part of the population have genetically identical twins, and I bet
neither do most of the people who don't want to see the same situations
created intentionally.  "Whatever that number is, it is the ideal number,
don't increase it, don't change anything, my cloned mind can't handle
change, just leave things the way they are!"

I think idea gestation (as opposed to contemplating thy >H navel)

What strikes me, from my browsing on the PT subject, is that it
is so easy. You don't even need a starting capital, only you're able
to be more or less flexible with where and how you get your income.
Opening an offshore bank account doesn't seem more difficult than
doing it at your local bank. (It's sad that, at least here in Sweden,
tax-crime is regarded as one of the most serious crime you can
commit, in fact much worse that murder).

>With a proper structure of offshore companies and trusts, I can run

I think you're right when emphasizing on *structure* and not money.
For example, if you take the money you spend on an apartment and
your office (and add the none-tax bonus), you'll probably get a decent
hotel room where you can sleep and work.

>Which brings me to an aside. Why do we need, as Extropians who embrace

The family still is and will continue to be important. But still,
its not an obstacle for the PT. Event if you travel a lot, you'll

Thanks for kicking ass. I just came from http://www.foresight.org 
(finally being able to telnet to pine & http at the same time). What I saw 
there left me very very impressed. Seeing is believing, but there not 
simply pretty pictures there. I am now more determined than ever to pick up

Yeah, right. Very true. Exposure to this list helps to recalibrate one in

Exactly. It seems to me to be the ultimate freedom. If you can work
remotely, doing consulting, programming, freelance writing, etc., you
can BE anywhere. And you dont have to TRAVEL. Check out Vince Cate,
http://www.offshore.com.ai/vince, who lives in Anguilla, a true
tropical paradise, and rents a nice home for $500 a month, and pays
zero income tax. (check out the view from his house at
www.offshore.com.ai/vince/view.jpg , that's St. Martin/Maarten in the
distance. I pay $500/mo in Cincinnati, Ohio and have a lovely view of
the parking lot.)

There was a story some time back on Americans who had moved to the
Czech Republic and were doing telecommuting work. While not a tax
haven, the guy I read about rented a 2800 square foot loft for like
$50/mo US.

Also, I dont see this as Tax "evasion". If you try to hide money from
the US government, you're stupid. They'll catch you. True PT is REAL
tax free living, you arent avoiding taxes, because you dont owe any.

As a US citizen, if I spend no more than 21 days in the country in a
given tax year, the first $70,000 of my income is tax free. I can also
deduct any housing costs from my offshore income before I figure out
my taxable income. All the while maintaining US citizenship and full
rights. On a well laid out PT structure, it would be easy to live VERY
well on $70,000US.

Definitely. People think that it is expensive to live in the
Caribbean, because they only think of the posh resorts. Vince lives in
paradise for $500/mo. Cable & Wireless does provide Internet
connectivity off the Island, and there has been modern digital
switched phone service to the whole island for quite some time.

The structure is the key. Both for anonymity and tax abatement. The
structure I envision involves a network of companies in several places
about the world. Every country has it's inherent benefits. Banking is
good in Belize, Income tax is gone in Anguilla, Cayman, and the like.
There's a portion of Switzerland, 50 square miles or so, that is
legally owned by Italy. It's fairly easy, albeit a bit pricey, to set
up companies there under Italian law with all rights of Swiss
companies, but without the strict foreign ownership laws and control
reporting. You also gain free entry and travel to switzerland,
lichtenstein, and Italy.

I've been pondering this very subject VERY hard for the past several
weeks. At the risk of using a cliche, I've come to realize that Wealth
doesnt equal money. You only need enough to support the lifestyle you
want. If you do what you want, live where you want, and feel 'Free',
then you are wealthy. Dont get me wrong, I'd love to be obscenely
rich. But I think I could live as a PT for actually alot less than I
make now.

To quote Bill Shakespeare, "Aye, there's the rub." I have a wife and a
2 year old son. My wife doesnt want to move away from her family. If I
were a single man, I could detach fairly easy.

I have a similar priority view.

Although I'm very interested in a transhuman future and try to orient
myself to take advantage of potential "interesting" developments as
they arise, that isn't what I think about all day long.

I've taken certain concrete steps to try to try to assure my survival
into the future -- I've signed up for cryonics, I try to eat as
healthy a diet as I can, etc. -- and I try to take the probable
direction of the future into account when planning my
actions. However, the fact is, we aren't yet in the final slide into
transhumanity or posthumanity, and for the most part there is very
little to be done about such things on a day to day basis.

Unlike Carl, I have no family, so my family isn't a priority. My #1
priority is remaining healthy and conscious into the indefinate
future, but I've already taken all steps I think can be reasonably
taken in that regard. My #2 priority, which consumes most of my tiem,
is assuring I have sufficient resources at my disposal to do whatever
I feel might need doing in the future. Somewhere way down the list --
far below the point where you can even assign numbers -- comes
"participate in the extropian movement".

Were a massive breakthrough in nanotech to occur next week, I suspect
that my priorities would remain the same, although my means of
achieving them might shift.

I think this is as it should be. As an objectivist (but not a high
church objectivist by any means!) I feel my top priority is caring for
me and those things important to me, and given that I have no
offspring to pay attention to, and no life partner, that pretty much
just leaves me. Caring for myself implies assuring my survival, short
term and long term, and trying to (on a slightly higher level) plan
ahead to make sure I have the resources needed to achieve things I want.

Perhaps sometime I'll discover there is some way I could save the
world, but if its worth saving, its worth saving only if I personally
need it saved, or if a profit is to be earned in the process of saving
it.

What, then, does Extropianism mean for me?

Well, it provides me with an augmented world view and a community of
friends. This has had concrete dividends -- I actually took the step
of signing up for cryonics after becoming surrounded by other
cryonicists, for example. I've gained some perspective and some
entertainment out of the community, and I'm happy about that. So long
as it continues to pay off a bit in this way, I'll continue reading.

I think this is a healthy view. Just because we interact with each
other and share grandiose dreams we are not getting closer to
implementing them. What we do here is more like sharing memes, ideas
and visions that we can use in real life. This list isn't the place
where the first steps to transhumanity will be taken, they will be
taken (or rather, have been taken a long while ago) in the soil of
the physical world - but we might be guided by what we learn here.

Personally I hope to play a role in bringing about many of these
visions by applying my intellect to certain research areas (such as
the neuroscience of memory), my skills of communications to convince
more people that transhumanism is a good (or at least acceptable) 
idea and by practically trying to implement a transhuman life for
myself.

Of course, if anybody has any practical idea for a worldwide
transhumanist conspiracy, I might be interested. :-)

I watched Star Trek: First Contact yesterday, and enjoyed it (despite
the holes in the logic and technobabble - after all, it is Star
Trek). The mood of the film was if not transhumanist at least
humanist; one idea that was repeatedly stressed was the drive to
better oneself - even the Borg claimed they were doing it. While the
real story was about the fight against the Borg, the other plot
(making sure the first warp ship was launched at the right time to
bring about first contact) was fairly well presented and used every
trick in the book to evoke enthusiasm in a sf lover like me.

Anyway, as you might guess I cheered for the Borg during the film :-) 
And being a logical kind of person I was somewhat irritated by how
they were treated since they are actually something rather unique: a
truly alien kind of alien in a popular sf universe. 

Their problem is that they are almost too good enemies: if the Borg
didn't make obvious mistakes and move slowly so they can easily be
hit (together with saying "Resistance is futile" this forms the
dreaded Dalek Syndrome) they would be practically invincible, which
of course wouldn't go down well with the audience.

This also explains the Borg Queen: imagine that the Collective just
spoke through the nearest borg instead of through a seductive lady
with slight alien queen tendencies; it would simply be too impersonal
and nasty for most viewers to handle, even if it is more logical.

Post hoc rationalizations are quite popular among trekkies, so here
are some of transhumanist relevance:

The idea of a Borg Queen was never explored fully. She explained her
function as "I bring order into chaos". If we see the Collective as a
MIMD supermind, this can actually make sense: ordinary borgs acts as
normal processors, but the Queen acts as a higher order processor
managing information flow and resolving conflicts. She doesn't rule,
rather arbitrate; groups of borgs might develop plans and evaluate
them, she makes a decision when there is a tie between different
subsets. The movie appeared slightly inconsistent about her
uniqueness; on one hand the main characters appeared to believe her
to be unique, but she also laughed at the idea of her having been
destroyed together with the Borg ship where Picard first encountered
as "You humans think so three-dimensionally!". One possible
explanation is that every Borg ship simply has one queen, they are
instances (clones?) of an original queen and can be replaced if
needed. True object re-use. 

The Borg Collective represents an extreme evolutionary strategy, that
of turning all non-self into self. Note that they doesn't seem to
change themselves much by assimilating others, which either suggests
that they just overwrite originality with their standard template, or
that the Collective is so large that adding another civilization
doesn't change it much. If the Borg was a bit nicer about it and used
guile, it could probably assimilate more effectively (but that would
make them too subtle villains to be interesting in the series). 

Assimilation of others is an evolutionarily stable strategy: a small
subgroup of mutant borgs that doesn't assimilate others will be
assimilated themselves. So this might be one possible future track in
the Convergence Hypothesis described by Nicholas Boström: once a
substantial part of a civilization becomes borg-like, it will
assimilate the rest and a Collective will result.

The Borg are essentially a parasitic form of intelligence, using
other intelligent life to provide raw materials, individuals and
ideas. Their actual physical manifestation doesn't really matter, it
is their basic memes and abilities that define them. Hans Moravec
suggested in Mind Children that we should look out for "civilization
parasites" among messages sent across interstellar space; there might
be memes out there that use intelligent life to spread in more or
less nasty ways. Turning them into Borgs is just one possibility
(this is what the Blight did in AFUTD). In fact, they might be
weapons: Linda Nagata suggests one such ultra-subtle weapon in
_Deception Well_.

An interesting question is if symbiotic forms of intelligence can
exist. If there are enough "hosts", symbiotic intelligences might
integrate themselves into the system and become indispensable. Just
think of the tribbles of Star Trek, or the possibility of us humans
becoming symbionts with our AI systems in order to survive the
Singularity.

Polluted water can cause brain damage that leads to a life of crime,
researcher claims

Copyright =A9 1997 Reuter Information Service=20

LONDON (May 29, 1997 00:49 a.m. EDT) - New Scientist magazine reported 
Thursday that polluted water can cause brain damage that turns ordinary 
people into violent criminals.

It quoted a U.S. researcher who said he had made a careful analysis showing
that toxic metals in drinking water were linked to crime rates.

Roger Masters of Dartmouth College in New Hampshire compared crime figures
from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with information on
industrial discharges of lead and manganese from the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA).

He found a definite link between pollution figures and levels of murder,
assault and robbery. Counties with the highest pollution levels had crime
rates triple the national average.

"The presence of pollution is as big a factor as poverty," Masters told New
Scientist.

Masters has written about his findings in a book, Environmental Toxicology,
to be published later this year. He says there is a physical basis for the
phenomenon.

Experiments have shown lead can inhibit the action of glial cells, which
help clean up unwanted chemicals in the brain. Other tests have shown
manganese can interfere with levels of the neurotransmitters serotonin and
dopamine -- chemical messengers linked with mood and behavior.

"It's the breakdown of the inhibition mechanism that's the key to violent
behavior," Masters said.

"This quite likely has something in it," Ken Pease, director of the Applied
Criminology Research Unit at the University of Huddersfiled, told New=
 Scientist.

"But I think the approach badly needs individual data to nail it down."

Data: pollution, poverty, and crime are found in the same areas.

Old idea: poverty caused crime.
Discovery: pollution is there too.
New idea: pollution causes crime.
Missing: what causes the poverty?
Possible extension: the crime!  Or the brain damage from the pollution.

Extension of old idea: poverty causes crime.  Poverty also "causes"
pollution, in that the rich make sure pollution says away from them, so
it ends up being dumped on the poor.  (Not because anyone hates the
poor, but because no one cares.)  So crime and pollution are correlated,
but separately traceable to pre-existing poverty.

Proposal for observational discrimination: compare pollution and crime
rates of American inner cities to Eastern bloc cities.  South-central LA
to downtown Prague.  My hypothesis is that one will find more pollution
in Prague but less crime (obviously to be serious you'd compare many
cities, or the average of each set.)  My general prediction is that
if typical pollution does increase crime it is at best a high-order[1]
effect, and should not distract from the lower-order effects such as
poverty and lack of education.

[1] I'm using low-order to mean significant, high-order insignificant,
from the terminology of infinite series where you hope the first term is
dominant and that later terms slink off to zero.  Is that the meaning
people think of, or do people, or lay people, assumie "high-order" means
more important than "low-order"?

The Borg saga has taken a new twist with the season finale of the 
Star Trek Voyager series, in which the Borg encounter a species with 
extremely dense DNA that overwhelms their attempts at assimilation.  
The Voyager crew is faced with making their way through Borg space 
and try to cut a deal with the Borg after they develop what they 
think is a method of fighting the biological hordes utilizing Borg 
technology.  There is an excellent explanation of Borg assimilation 
technique, as well.

Of course, we won't find out what happens for several months, but it 
is interesting to see a storyline developed between two possible 
modes of projected evolution.

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

An interesting point of view. If one were to take the supposed view of
aliens as they see Federation humans, then exaggerrate and amplify the
worst culltural characteristics, you would get the Borg. In a similar
fashion, as I pointed out several years ago, the Ferrenghi are similarly
distorted visions of Americans to many foreigners. If you look up the
word Ferreghi in, I beleive an Arab dictionary, one will find a term
that loosly means a dirty money grubbing infidel westerner.

The fact that Masters is at Dartmouth says it all to me. I live 4 miles
from campus ( I grew up here). Dartmouth is a liberal arts college, i.e.
its so called "scientific" studies are typically published for the
purpose of rubber stamping a previously agreed upon politically correct
leftist liberal opinion, lobbying position, or public policy of a
liberal government body. The official position of the faculty is that
objective science is an artifact of bigoted northern european male
culture. These people are so stupid that a professor of toxicology
poisoned herself with mercury and didn't even know about it until she
was in the emergency ward recovering from a two week long coma.

Yeah. I happen to know Hans Thulin (sp?), a Swede who was the first
Swedish real estate billionaire. Seems the Swedish IRS came up with a
tax bill that was 110% of his income and assets, so he skipped the
country with a couple of suitcases of dough and offshore bank accounts.
He moved to Seattle where he bought out the West Coast Hotel Chain and
grew it from less than 15 hotels up to over 50 in a span of less than 5
years. Eventually, the INS was ordered to extradite him back to Sweden
to face his "crimes", but he found out about the order early and caught
a flight elsewhere. The last time I talked to him was when he called a
freind of mine and I from his yatch off Argentina, 2 years ago. He now
hardly ever goes within national waters. He sends a launch with crew
ashore to provision and ferry fuel when needed.

Its interesting that the story implied that this new species are
ferocious fighters who live by an extremely Darwinian credo: "And the
weak shall perish." This would explain why their military technologies
have reached such a high level that they can take on and wipe out a Borg
Armada of 15 cubes with ease. That they originate from a thin stream of
space that is awash in "gravi-temporal disturbances" would imply the
possibility that they are an extremely advanced species from the far
future (which would explain the dense DNA, which would resist rediation
better than ours does) possibly near the opemga point. Their extreme
level of evolvement, and DNA radiation resistance together point to
this. 

Working with the Borg serves a useful strategic interest, not only of
the Voyager, but of the Federation. The Borg are apparently the only
thing impeding this new species advancement into Federation space. If
you help the Borg fight the new species, they will 1) be less likely to
flee into Federation space, and 2)be more occupied with fighting the new
species than in fleeing, thus slowing the Borg expansion into Federation
space.

Another possibility is that this conflict is what caused the Borg to
become borganized. This may have happened as a desperate response to
this overwhelming threat. What they do to other species is seen in the
collective as of utmost importance as it is supporting the "defense
effort" against this alien species.

Good grief, Erik, could you perhaps apply a little bit of judgement to 
what you forward?  Before the 43-line article, you treated us to 35 lines 
of header -- which might (I suppose) be useful to someone looking for ways 
to intercept or forge your mail, but added nothing to the value of the 
article (and indeed, at the end of that 35 lines we find that the article

It's not a technological problem. You can get >200 MHz laptops with
enough memory to do almost anything you would with a desktop
computer. Internet is usually not a problem, 56K modem or perhaps
ISDN will get you far enough. As a mobile knowledge worker, you
don't need any reference books, most of the information is on the
Internet or on CD-roms.

Mobile working is also getting less and less a social problem, as
communication is getting better and better. Teamwork will always
require a fair amount of communication between the players, but
physical distance is no longer an obstable for that. You still have
to meet people face to face, but being mobile will be an advantage,
not a disadvantage.

I can't think of any jobs that I would like to do that I couldn't do
anywhere. (I admit working on the factory floor for some big
software company is not on my list.) To me, the only difference
and the only reason to go mobile is to become truly Transnational
and Transcultural.

Bad thing with them, you can work just a few hours in untethered mode. 
Admittedly, this is rarely required. I'd still like a solar augmented fuel
cell, for religion reasons. Roaming is getting better, but one'd still
need Iridium to be a "go-anywhere" technomad. Iridium is going to be
expensive, though, I wonder about what Teledesic's rates might be (nudge, 
nudge).

I am really looking forward to wearables, with really adequate headup,
large storage and sophisticated GUIs. Using cellphones has become socially
acceptable very rapidly, I wonder however how long it takes until people
with headsets, heavy hipbelts and black monocles, with a micro CCD
embedded, while babbling to invisible presences, won't raise eyebrows
anymore. I think Linux to be an excellent platform (most of the MIT
wearables used it), albeit speech input was pretty nonexistant half a year
ago. As PC hardware has the embedded microcontroller market now pervaded,
cheap low-juice hardware should be quite easy to get. Any proprietary
distributed embedded solution would be superiour, but clearly noviable due
to nonexistant software base. I am still waiting for any major outfit
having the guts to challenge the PC cul de sac, by build a consumer maspar
DSP box. This sure'd be a reason for throwing a major party.

Those who are signed up with a CSP are going to need an automatic
emergency pager anyway, so'd they'd be using biotelemetry, and a
cellmodem, already. Consider this a CFI (call for ideas) for just such a
pager; which can be incrementally morphed into a wearable. I know Hara Ra
is interested in building just a gadget, prior to that we the local Kraut
cryos had also plans which were progressed pretty far, but which died due
to insufficient funding. I'd still like this to result in a viable design,
whether commercial, or in the public domain.

True. I am going to scan and OCR the bulk of my library in the course of
next years, though.  Some of the relevant stuff isn't on the net yet, and
some never will. 
 
ciao,
'gene

P.S. I'm reading up on some peculiar crackpot topics just now. I have now
firmly identified Bohm as the originator of the quantum mind conspiracy. 
I have found early Kauffman in "Kinetic Logic -- A Boolean Approach to the
Analysis of Complex Regulatory Systems", a 1977 Lecture Notes in
Biomathematics Proceedings in Brussels. "Vision, Instuction and Action" 
by David Chapman is a great read on how far brittle AI is going to get us
(this is an expert system playing an arcade game. It uses vision, but it
does not ANN nor GA). The "Art of Molecular Dynamics" by D.C. Rapaport is
a good in-depth introduction for those interested in modeling nanotech. I
am reading an ancient Russian book on design of spacecraft, the book on
mail from Marshall T. Rose's Internet trilogy. I also came across early De
Garis, his LIZZY (GA evolving neural control) sounds very cool. As an
uploader, I am worried about suspected CA-like computation properties of
microtubulin, though this has fair chance of being bogus, having been
published in the infamous "Rethinking Neural Networks: Quantum Fields and
Biological Data".

	I was thinking parallel universe.  It would avoid a lot of paradoxes of
time travel.  Both violate the laws of physic so either one is a valid
choice.  They could be from an older parallel universe.  
	The "gravi-temporal disturbances" could be there way of practicing
intergalactic travel.  I seem to remember an episode of TNG were a crew
member was made super smart by an alien probe.  He then proceeded to warp
space-time, which caused gravitational distortions, to bring the ship
instantly to the center of the galaxy to meet the senders of the probe
(harmless, if non-corporeal, researchers).

I was wondering, is every single alien and alien ship going to be
destroyed?  If even one was left the borg could assimilate it and they
would be unstoppable.  Of course, the fact that the borg could not develop
nanite warfare and a Federation computer (the holographic doctor) could
shows a certain lack of ability to improvise.

Also, in a previous voyager episode they documented (in a fashion) the
evolution of the borg.  A borg ship became dysfunctional and the crew fled
to a planet below.  They lost their connectivity and started to fight
because they were species trained to hate each other.  One group (a
commune) wanted to reestablish the collective because it would mean peace. 
They used coercive tactics to do so and succeeded.  They did not proceed to
try and assimilate anyone but no one else was a threat.  The original
commune thought that they were not only assuring their own existence but
that they were also improving the condition of everyone on the planet. 
This mentality could easily be extended to all life forms.  

I, like Anders, think the borg are a very interesting alien.  I also think
they are a  great evolutionary step forward.  It may be that each and every
individual in the collective thinks they are still an individual but with
access to a great deal of resources and not residing in any one place. 
Therefore, the individual would be just as inclined to sacrifice himself as
anyone else.  Of course, an individual with access to these resources might
find himself gradually scrapping every part of him that was him before
assimilation because it is no longer useful.  Bring on the borgs!

 Of course. The reasons you initially gave for buying Coke were
indistinguishable from those of a typical investor, so the simplest
hypothesis that explained your reasons was that you were following the crowd.

 This reasoning is better.

 It's a mistake to avoid a stock because it's at an all-time high.
This seems to be one of the circumstances the average investor is most
likely to underestimate a company. I suspect that this results from something
like a belief in the labor theory of value - if there was a consensus
that a company's fair value was in a certain range, then there seems to
be a clear presumption that it ought to be continue in that range.

 This should reduce your confidence, as it indicates that there is little
room for mainstream investors to improve their opinion of Coke.
 Remember that unless your information is better than that of the
people who are selling Coke, you have no reason to think you will
outperform them.

 I am a lot more cautious than you are about assuming that consumers
who evaluate products differently than I do are ignorant. I don't want
other people deciding what's best for me as a consumer, and I expect
other people to not want me trying to make their decisions for them.

 Trying to fight trash by moving investment dollars out of companies
whose environmental effects are as ordinary as Coke's is one of the
least cost-effective strategies around, as you are fighting a very
broad profit motive. If a company clearly stands out for doing things
that neither I nor the people affected by those actions approve of,
I will avoid them, but I don't expect this to accomplish much unless
it is targetted against actions that offend a large fraction of the
population.
 A more effective strategy for environmentalism is to channel people's
selfishness in the right direction, by improving legal systems so that
the costs of environmental harm are born by people who have control
over those costs. For example, taxpayer financed trash collection should
be replaced by a system in which people who want their trash removed pay
something related to the costs of disposing of that trash.

 Of course I should try to evolve all aspects of my existence. I see
no reason why altruism is the right direction to evolve towards.

 I see no reason to expect any one philosophy to be complete.

A slightly outlandish thought just came to me: why not using the Extro 3
convention as an opportunity to exchange PGP keys in a nonvirtual meet?
(Face2face contacts being still the most reliable form of communication).
(Mental note for the future: meetings in the flesh are obligatory, but
certainly tedious, proper bandwidth and appropriate infrastructure at a
central location provided, organized future virtual meetings (avatar,
audio, and possibly video feed, area for document (text, gfx, VRML,
whatever) presentation) in a VR environment appear both implementable and
worthwhile. An "Invisible College", and a "Ye Olde Black Sun Lounge and
Pool Club" might both provide a motivation focus, a means of socializing
and might generate unfathomable future spinoffs (enhanced GUIs, &c &c). I
am tight on time currently, but I sure would like to work on this
nonprofit, starting sometime next year. Linux/Java seem the most obvious
implementation platforms. Please offer your comments. 

I cannot really rationalize why particularly crypto (hey, just because you
are paranoid it doesn't mean they are not really after you), but the PGP
key swap party might possibly be of 1) future administrative use for the
list 2) install a more or less secure bootstrap channel for unspecified
future bricabrac transfer 3) current strong crypto ban possibly impending,
be a non-negligeable libertarian attitude display 4) substitute this point
for your favourite neoludd nightmare. 

It would seem to be a good thing if the Extropy Institute (EI) would
generate and distribute among participant sone key for secure all->EI
link. See no much use for the reverse direction, but still see no harm in
doing this also. 

As I am really clueless about crypto, knowlegeable persons please step
forth and comment.

The subjective life of borganisms is a fascinating field to speculate
on. The "classic" view is of course that there is just one big
consciousness, the Collective. But it might be possible that each
unit is an individual, able to think for itself but still a part of
the Collective. Note that these two possibilities form a continuum: 
on one hand fully independent individuals and on the other hand a
single distributed mind, with mixtures in between. As the bandwidth
between their minds increase, they become more and more a single unit
(the Collective is simply the metaindividual which forms). There is
no reason to think all units of a borganism needs to be identical,
instead it might be useful to have many different kinds (both
physically and mentally).

It is not certain the optimal state is total unity, that might cause
undue waste of bandwidth. If bandwidth is limited there is no point
in broadcasting all mental activity, so keeping some of it internal
is reasonable. The topology of the network is also important, since
it might cause differentiation: a group of units somewhat isolated
from the Collective would form a small borganism relatively loosely
connected with the Collective, and if the units were stringed out we
would get a "linear mind" (like the tine sentries in AFUTD).

This might be a reason for the borgs standing in their niches as seen
in Star Trek: when not on duty, they take advantage of the high
bandwidth of the intranet of the borg ship to truly become one, while
as mobile workers they are less integrated (this may post hoc explain
their inefficiency).

As I mentioned earlier, the typical borg emotionlessness and
callousness can be explained by their form of thinking: a borganism
can have intense emotions, but they are not displayed since it is
unnecessary (why smile when everybody else in the Collective also is
amused? ), and to a borganism individuals are just as uninteresting
as single cells; although I could imagine a friendly borganism which
for one reason or another took interest in their lives; however, to
the borganism the easiest way of communication would be to assimilate
a few individuals - that way it would also get a lot more information
about the individuals - but there is little need to make the
assimilation permanent. 

Note that even individual units of a borganism doesn't need to fear
death; it would probably be a trivial matter to do regular backups of
their minds (like the Culture warships do in Iain Bank's
_Excession_), and if they are simply copies of each other there is no
reason to worry about the end of individual existence.

This notion that the Borg are uncreative doesn't wash with me.  All those
people standing around, their minds all hooked up, forming the Collective...
What are they thinking *about*?  Surely such a mind could see the strategic
necessity of advancing technology.

This also raises the question, how did the Borg acquire the technology they
have?  Generally speaking, in a competition, the higher technology will
win, especially when you are talking about phasers and shields and warp
drives.  So the Borg should be unable to defeat an enemy with higher
technology than themselves.  The only reason they are a threat to the
Federation is because they have better technology.

This means that they should not have been able to assimilate a race which
possessed their current technology if all they had was Federation-style
phasers or something weaker.  Their ships would not have constituted a
threat to such a race.

I conclude that the Borg evolved as individuals (or at least in a state
where they could make technological progress) until they reached their
present level, *then* they formed the Collective as we see it, which has
stagnated technologically for some reason.

Of course, we all recognize that the Star Trek universe is a spectacularly
unlikely future, with their incredibly slow rate of technological
progress, lack of exploitation of nanotech, extremely limited medical
technology, under-utilization of AI despite its clear effectiveness, etc.

Their extremely fast rate of adaption might be because millions of
borgs are developing countermeasures in the background. Or perhaps
they are lost in "Infinite Fun Space" as the Minds in _Excession_
call it?

But suppose you let a few units and scout ships get attacked, and
then the rest of the Collective can safely learn from the attack and
figure out how to replicate it? As long as they doesn't encounter a
vastly superior foe they can sacrifice a few units and learn a lot
from it.

An interesting organism that I have speculated on is one that takes up the
entire universe.  If the speed of light was a barrier for such a creature
its thought processes would be interesting indeed.  Perhaps this is what is
meant by "linear mind" but I have yet to read AFUTD.

As previously mentioned, there is the possibility that the Borg became a
collective as a desperate effort to combat these aliens, that they have
been fighting this species on a stalemate basis for many hundreds of
years. Possibly they merely started out as a multi-race, multiworld
alliance much like the Federation, possibly given more to technological
augmentation than the hyper-liberal, hyper-humanist utopic Federation.
The outward expansion of the Borg into Federation space is merely the
Borg seeking out new sources of recruits and resources with which to
combat this alien incursion.

I imagine thoughts and sub-minds on different scales; after all, even our 
brains contain very independent subsystems. So one might imagine 
hierarchies of hinds where small, fast and less intelligent minds unite 
to form larger, slower and more powerful minds which in turn form 
metaminds (a bit like the planetary, stellar, galactic and universal 
minds of Stapledon's _Star Maker_). I wonder if self-organized 
criticality could apply to their sizes?

Not really, but it is an interesting idea. A (slight) spoiler for AFUTD:
the canine pack-minds in the book communicate using ultrasound, and if the
bodies of an individual get stringed out its thoughts are similarly
"linearized", they become slow and somewhat dull but the two ends of the
line can communicate fairly quickly. This is used for perimeter sentries; 
an attack is immediately relayed along the perimeter. There are mentions
of other ways they can influence their thinking through pack geometry.

	In place of "order", how about "authority"?

	When we first recognized our sovereignty we were bringing in a net of $8K
per month and living on $100 per month.  We lived in a 2m x 3m travel
trailer which we parked on the street, moving it every two or three days. 
We were a member of the YMCA for $100 per year, so we had full use of all
their facilities, including toilets, showers, pools, weight rooms, etc.  We
had food, clothes and shelter and we were free!  What more does one want? 
Well, a computer for one thing. :-)  After about four years of that we
created a small, private park where visitors could also feel free.  But we
really had a chance to see how little one needs of "things", and once one
is free from the urge to fill their lives with "things" they are really
free, free to make their own choices without all the shadow voices in the
head giving their opinion to sway their decision.  And you don't have to
worry about someone ripping-off your "things". :-)  Never locked doors,
never suffered a theft.

	And there there are many ways to accomplish that.  The main thing is, what
is it that holds one back?             
	What is of greater value than recognizing one's sovereignty?
	What's got a hold on you, Baby? :-)

Hi!

The best way for mankind to evolve is with unselfish actions. I share
Richard Dawkins' opinion that the individual is the most important but
for each individual to better prosper and achieve pleasure, cooperation
is the best path and selfishness is the worst. It's like a Prisoner's
Dilemma, the best choice is cooperation and defection will bring ruin to
us all. This is not altruism, it is logical reasoning with the objective
of determining what is better for my personal existance.

Agree, the infinite is our goal.

"to channel people's selfishness in the right direction", I love that
sentence. It can be applied to other areas besides Environmentalism.

Uggh! The Borg maybe interesting, but they certainly don't fit into my
Extropian future. They seem alot more like old-fashioned communists dressed
up with techno bondage gear than any great leap forward into
anarcho-capitalism.

I think that you should clarify your above statement to include 
matters of tactics and strategy.  Our own human war experiences 
contain many examples of low-tech strategies disabling 
higher-technology forces, including the use of civil disobedience in 
South America, the disabling of Nazi installations by the Resistance, 
and the American experience in Vietnam.  Technology in and of itself 
produces no effect in isolation from effective strategies tailored to 
the specific arena.  But that is if you choose to engage in the first 
place--the highest state of war involves the neutralizion of an 
enemy in advance of meeting them in combat.

It surprises me that no one had brought this point up before.  The
Borg, I would think, can be viewed as the ultimate criminals.  They
steal not only physical objects, but the bodies of sentients and
sentient minds as well.

They don't peacefully assimilate anything, they show up and they
destroy whatever defenses you have and finally absorb you, willing or
no, into their mental collective.

For something I'm writing, I'd like to be sure that I have the latest on
the age of the oldest person (according to validated records). I don't have
a current Guiness Book of Records and, to my surprise, I couldn't find it
with a quick AltaVista search.

As far as I know, the current record is 121 years and some months. Can
anyone tell me if this has been beaten?

Thanks,

Max

Max, 

For a list of the oldest people on the planet taken from the Guinness Book
of Records see:

http://avsunxsvr.aeiveos.com/longevity/longrec.html

This was found using HotBot-

http://www.hotbot.com/

The woman I mentioned before is listed here. She is Brazilian and her
name is Maria Do Carmo. Her claim is listed as unverified. Maybe she has
found proof since 1993 (the date of the Guinness book) and that was what
the TV program was about.

I heard on TV a couple of days ago that a woman has proof that she is
126 years old. She was from South America, possibly Brazil. Sorry I
can't tell you any more - I didn't see the full story. Maybe someone else
saw the whole feature (?)

BTW HotBot is a much more powerful search engine than Alta Vista.
