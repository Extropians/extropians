Since the List has now moved to its new server (being managed by ExI's new
List Administrator David McFadzean) and posts are now appearing on the
archive, it seems a good time to post the Extropian Principles. Many newer
subscribers may never have read them. They explain which attitudes those
calling themselves "Extropians" hold in common to various degrees, and so
explain the range of topics discussed on this list.

THE EXTROPIAN PRINCIPLES
V. 2.6
(Jan 1996)
=A91996 Max More, Ph.D.
President, Extropy Institute


EXTROPY =97 A measure of intelligence, information, energy, vitality,
experience, diversity, opportunity, and growth.
EXTROPIANISM =97 The philosophy that seeks to increase extropy.

Extropianism is a transhumanist philosophy: Like humanism, transhumanism
values reason and humanity and sees no grounds for belief in unknowable,
supernatural forces externally controlling our destiny, but goes further in
urging us to push beyond the merely human stage of evolution. As physicist
Freeman Dyson has said: "Humanity looks to me like a magnificent beginning
but not the final word." Religions traditionally have provided a sense of
meaning and purpose in life, but have also suppressed intelligence and
stifled progress. The Extropian philosophy provides an inspiring and
uplifting meaning and direction to our lives, while remaining flexible and
firmly founded in science, reason, and the boundless search for improvement.

1. Boundless Expansion =97 Seeking more intelligence, wisdom, and
effectiveness, an unlimited lifespan, and the removal of political,
cultural, biological, and psychological limits to self-actualization and
self-realization. Perpetually overcoming constraints on our progress and
possibilities. Expanding into the universe and advancing without end.

2. Self-Transformation =97 Affirming continual moral, intellectual, and
physical self-improvement, through reason and critical thinking, personal
responsibility, and experimentation. Seeking biological and neurological
augmentation.

3. Dynamic Optimism =97 Fueling dynamic action with positive expectations.
Adopting a rational, action-based optimism, shunning both blind faith and
stagnant pessimism.

4. Intelligent Technology =97 Applying science and technology creatively to
transcend "natural" limits imposed by our biological heritage, culture, and
environment.

5. Spontaneous Order  =97 Supporting decentralized, voluntaristic social
coordination processes. Fostering tolerance, diversity, long-term thinking,
personal responsibility, and individual liberty.

These principles are developed below. Deeper treatments can be found in
various issues of EXTROPY: The Journal of Transhumanist Thought =97
Spontaneous Order in #7, Dynamic Optimism in #8, and Self-Transformation in=
 #10.


1. BOUNDLESS EXPANSION

Extropians recognize the unique place of our species, and our opportunity to
advance nature=92s evolution to new peaks. Beginning as mindless matter,=
 parts
of nature developed in a slow evolutionary ascendence, leading to
progressively more powerful brains. Chemical reactions generated tropistic
behavior, which was superseded by instinctual and Skinnerian
stimulus-response behavior, and then by conscious learning and
experimentation. With the advent of the conceptual awareness of humankind,
the rate of advancement sharply accelerated as intelligence, technology, and
the scientific method were applied to our condition. We seek to sustain and
quicken this evolutionary process of expanding extropy, transcending
biological and psychological limits into posthumanity.

In aspiring to posthumanity, we reject natural and traditional limitations
on our possibilities. We champion the rational use of science and technology
to eradicate constraints on lifespan, intelligence, personal vitality,
freedom, and experience. We recognize the absurdity of meekly accepting
"natural" limits to our lifespans. The future will bring a graduation from
Earth =97 the cradle of human and transhuman intelligence =97 and the
inhabitation of the cosmos.

Resource limits are not immutable. Extropians affirm a rational,
market-mediated environmentalism aimed at sustaining and enhancing the
conditions for our flourishing. We oppose apocalyptic environmentalism which
hallucinates catastrophe, issues a stream of irresponsible doomsday
predictions, and attempts to strangle our continued evolution. Intelligent
management of resources and environment will be fostered by the Extropian
goal of vastly extended lifespan. The market price system encourages
conservation, substitution, and innovation, preventing any need for a brake
on growth and progress. Migration into space will immensely enlarge the
energy and resources accessible to our civilization. Extended lifespans will
foster wisdom and foresight, while restraining recklessness and profligacy.
=09
No mysteries are sacrosanct, no limits unquestionable; the unknown will
yield to the ingenious mind. We seek to understand the universe and to
master reality up to and beyond any currently foreseeable limits.


2. SELF-TRANSFORMATION

Extropians affirm reason, critical inquiry, intellectual independence, and
honesty. We reject blind faith and the passive, comfortable thinking that
leads to dogma, mysticism, and conformity. Our commitment to positive
self-transformation requires us to critically analyze our current beliefs,
behaviors, and strategies. Extropians therefore feel proud by readily
learning from error rather than by professing infallibility. We prefer
analytical thought to fuzzy but comfortable delusion, empiricism to
mysticism, and independent evaluation to conformity. We affirm a philosophy
of life but distance ourselves from religious dogma because of its blind
faith, debasement of human worth, and systematic irrationality.

We seek to become better than we are, while affirming our current worth.
Perpetual self-improvement =97 physical, intellectual, psychological, and
ethical =97 requires us to continually re-examine our lives. Self-esteem in
the present cannot mean self-satisfaction, since a probing mind can always
envisage a superior self in the future. Extropians are committed to
deepening their wisdom, honing their rationality, and augmenting their
physical and intellectual capabilities. We choose challenge over comfort,
innovation over emulation, transformation over torpor.
=09
Extropians are neophiles and experimentalists who track new research for
more efficient means of achieving goals and who are willing to explore novel
technologies of self-transformation. In our quest to advance to a posthuman
stage, we rely on our own judgment, seek our own path, and reject both blind
conformity and mindless rebellion. Extropians frequently diverge from the
mainstream because they refuse to be chained by any dogma, whether
religious, political, or intellectual. Extropians choose their values and
behavior reflectively, standing firm when required but responding flexibly
to new conditions.
=09
Personal responsibility and autonomy go hand-in-hand with
self-experimentation. Extropians take responsibility for the consequences of
their choices, refusing to blame others for the results of their own free
actions. Experimentation and self-transformation require risks; we wish to
be free to evaluate potential risks and benefits for ourselves, applying our
own judgment, and assuming responsibility for the outcome. We seek neither
to rule others nor to be ruled. We vigorously resist those who use the
institutionalized coercion of the State to impose their judgments of the
safety and effectiveness of various means of self-experimentation. Personal
responsibility and self-determination are incompatible with authoritarian
centralized control, which stifles the choices and spontaneous ordering of
autonomous persons.
=09
Coercion, whether for the purported "good of the whole" or for the
paternalistic protection of the individual, is unacceptable to us.
Compulsion breeds ignorance and weakens the connection between personal
choice and personal outcome, thereby destroying personal responsibility.
Extropians are rational individualists, living by their own judgment, making
reflective, informed choices, profiting from both success and shortcoming.
=09
As neophiles, Extropians study advanced, emerging, and future technologies
for their self-transformative potential. We support biomedical research to
understand and control the aging process. We examine any plausible means of
conquering death, including interim measures like biostasis, and long-term
possibilities such as migration of personality from biological bodies into
superior embodiments ("uploading").
=09
We practice and plan for biological and neurological augmentation through
means such as neurochemical enhancers, computers and electronic networks,
General Semantics, fuzzy logic, and other guides to effective thinking,
meditation and visualization techniques, accelerated learning strategies,
applied cognitive psychology, and soon neural-computer integration.
Shrugging off the limits imposed on us by our natural heritage, we apply the
evolutionary gift of our rational, empirical intelligence, aiming to surpass
the confines of our humanity.


3. DYNAMIC OPTIMISM

Extropians espouse a positive, dynamic, empowering attitude. Seeing no
rational support for belief in a non-physical "afterlife", we seek to
realize our ideals in this world. Rather than enduring an unfulfilling life
sustained by a desperate longing for an illusory heaven, we direct our
energies enthusiastically into moving toward our ever-evolving vision.

Living vigorously, effectively, and joyfully, requires dismissing gloom,
defeatism, and ingrained cultural negativism. Problems =97 technical,=
 social,
psychological, ecological =97 are to be acknowledged but not allowed to
dominate our thinking and our direction. We respond to gloom and defeatism
by exploring and exploiting new possibilities. Extropians hold an optimistic
view of the future, foreseeing potent antidotes to many ancient human
ailments, requiring only that we take charge and create that future. Dynamic
optimism disallows passively waiting and wishing for tomorrow; it propels us
exuberantly into immediate activity, confidently confronting today=92s
challenges while generating more potent solutions for our future.
=09
We question limits others take for granted. Observing accelerating
scientific and technical learning, ascending standards of living, and
evolving social and moral practices, we project continuing progress. Today
there are more researchers studying aging, medicine, computers,
biotechnology, nanotechnology, and other enabling disciplines than in all of
history. Technological and social development continue to accelerate
leading, in the eyes of some of us, to a Singularity =97 a time in the=
 future
when everything will be so radically different from today, and changing so
fast, that we cannot accurately foresee life beyond that horizon. Extropians
strive to maintain the pace of progress by encouraging support for crucial
research, and pioneering the implementation of its results.
=09
Adopting dynamic optimism means focusing on possibilities and opportunities,
being alert to solutions and potentialities. It means refusing to whine
about what cannot be avoided, learning from mistakes rather than dwelling on
them in a victimizing, punishing manner. Dynamic optimism requires us to
take the initiative, to jump up and plough into our difficulties, our
actions declaring that we can achieve our goals, rather than sitting back
and submerging ourselves in defeatist thinking.
=09
Our actions and words radiate dynamic optimism, inspiring others to excel.
We are responsible for taking the initiative in spreading this invigorating
optimism; sustaining and strengthening our own dynamism is more easily
achieved in a mutally reinforcing environment. We stimulate optimism in
others by communicating our Extropian ideas and by living our ideals.
=09
Dynamic optimism and passive faith are incompatible. Faith in a better
future is confidence that an external force, whether God, State, or
extraterrestrials, will solve our problems. Faith, or the Pollyanna/Dr.
Pangloss variety of optimism, breeds passivity by promising progress as a
gift bestowed on us by superior forces. But, in return for the gift, faith
requires a fixed belief in and supplication to external forces, thereby
creating dogmatic beliefs and irrationally rigid behavior. Dynamic optimism
fosters initiative and intelligence, assuring us that we are capable of
improving life through our own efforts. Opportunities and possibilities are
everywhere, calling to us to seize them and to build upon them. Attaining
our goals requires only that we believe in ourselves, work diligently, and
be willing to revise our strategies.
=09
Where others see difficulties, we see challenges. Where others give up, we
move forward. Where others say enough is enough, we say: Forward! Upward!
Outward! We espouse personal, social, and technological evolution into ever
higher forms. Extropians see too far and change too rapidly to feel future
shock. Let us advance the wave of evolutionary progress.


4. INTELLIGENT TECHNOLOGY

Extropians affirm the necessity and desirability of science and technology.
We use practical methods to advance our goals of expanded intelligence,
superior physical abilities, self-constitution, and immortality, rather than
joining the well-trodden path of comfortable self-delusion, mysticism, and
credulity. We regard science and technology as indispensable means to the
evolution and achievement of our most noble values, ideals, and visions. We
seek to foster these disciplined forms of intelligence, and to direct them
toward eradicating the barriers to our extropian objectives, radically
transforming both the internal and external conditions of existence.
=09
Technology is a natural extension and expression of human intellect and
will, of creativity, curiosity, and imagination. We foresee and encourage
the development of ever more flexible, smart, responsive technology. We will
co-evolve with the products of our minds, integrating with them, finally
merging with our intelligent technology in a posthuman synthesis, amplifying
our abilities and extending our freedom.
=09
Profound technological innovation excites rather than frightens us. We
welcome change, expanding our horizons, exploring new territory boldly and
inventively. We favor careful and cautious development of powerful
technologies, but will neither stifle evolutionary advancement nor cringe
before the unfamiliar. Regarding timidity and stagnation as unworthy of us,
we choose to stride valiantly into the future. Extropians therefore favor
surging ahead =97 delighting in future shock =97 rather than ignobly=
 stagnating
or reverting to primitivism. Intelligent use of biotechnology,
nanotechnology, space and other technologies, in conjunction with a free
market system, can remove resource constraints and discharge environmental
pressures.
=09
We see the coming years and decades as a time of enormous changes, changes
that we can use to vastly expand our opportunities and abilities,
transforming our lives for the better. This technological transformation
will be accelerated by genetic engineering, life extending biosciences,
intelligence intensifiers, smarter interfaces to swifter computers,
neural-computer integration, virtual reality, enormous and interconnected
databases, swift electronic communications, artificial intelligence,
neuroscience, neural networks, artificial life, off-planet migration, and
nanotechnology.


5. SPONTANEOUS ORDER

Extropians emphasize self-generating, organic, spontaneous orders over
centrally planned, imposed orders. Both types of order have their place, but
the under-appreciated spontaneous variety are crucial for our social
interactions. Spontaneous orders have properties that make them especially
conducive to Extropian goals and values; we see spontaneously ordering
processes in many contexts, including biological evolution, the
self-regulation of ecosystems, artificial life studies, memetics (the study
of replicating information patterns), agoric open systems (market-like
allocation of computational resources), brain function and neurocomputation.
=09
The principle of spontaneous order is embodied in the free market system =97=
 a
system that does not yet exist in a pure form. We are evolving away from
tribalism, feudalism, authoritarianism, and democracy towards a polycentric
system of distributed power shared among autonomous agents, their plans
coordinated by the economic network. The free market allows complex
institutions to develop, encourages innovation, rewards individual
initiative, cultivates personal responsibility, fosters diversity, and
decentralizes power. Market economies spur the technological and social
progress essential to the Extropian philosophy. We have no use for the
technocratic idea of central control by self-proclaimed experts. No group of
experts can understand and control the endless complexity of an economy and
society. Expert knowledge is best harnessed and transmitted through the
superbly efficient mediation of the free market=92s price signals =97=
 signals
that embody more information than any person or organization could ever=
 gather.
=09
Sustained progress and effective, rational decision-making require the
diverse sources of information and differing perspectives that evolve in
spontaneous orders. Centralized command of behavior constrains exploration,
diversity, and dissenting opinion. Respecting spontaneous order means
supporting voluntaristic, autonomy-maximizing institutions as opposed to
rigidly hierarchical, authoritarian groupings with their bureaucratic
structure, suppression of innovation and dissent, and smothering of
individual incentives. Our understanding of spontaneous orders grounds our
opposition to self-proclaimed and involuntarily imposed "authorities", and
makes us skeptical of political solutions, unquestioning obedience to
leaders, and inflexible hierarchies.
=09
Making effective use of a spontaneously ordering social system requires a
degree of tolerance and self-restraint, allowing others to pursue their
lives as they choose, just as we wish to be free to go our own way. Mutual
progress and fulfillment will result from a cooperative and benevolent
attitude towards all those who respect our rights. Tolerating diversity and
disagreement requires us to maintain control of the impulses built into the
human organism, and to uphold demanding standards of rational personal
behavior. Extropians are guided in their actions by studying the fields of
strategy, decision theory, game theory, and ethology. These reveal to us the
benefits of cooperation, and encourage the long-term thinking appropriate to
persons seeking an unlimited lifespan.


CONCLUSION

These are principles not only of belief but of action. We become transhuman
only when we have fully integrated these values into our lives, when we have
consciously transformed ourselves ready for the future, rising above
outmoded human beliefs and behaviors. When technology allows us to
reconstitute ourselves physiologically, genetically, and neurologically, we
who have become transhuman will be primed to transform ourselves into
posthumans =97 persons of unprecedented physical, intellectual, and
psychological capacity, self-programming, potentially immortal, unlimited
individuals.
=09
As posthumans we will both embody extropy and generate more =97 more
intelligence, information, energy, vitality, experience, diversity,
opportunity, and growth. The Extropian Principles serve as a codification of
values helpful in guiding us into the future. These Principles continue to
evolve and cannot replace independent thinking by the individual.

I have long been curious to what extent people here actually do hold
Max's attitudes in common, and whether there are other simpler
predictors of who will call themselves "Extropians".  I've posted
before about my surveys of personality types and birth order
predictors.  My intuition is that what we mainly have in common is
technical understanding and a genuine excitement and willingness to
think carefully about the near and distant future.

It would be possible to construct a survey of Extropians and some
control sample of non-Extropians, with questions about agree/disagree
with Max's attitudes, about personality type, and about the other
predictors I mentioned, and then do some statistics to see which of
these are the best predictors.

I'm very interested in finding out more about the kinds of people who think
of themselves as extropians or Extropians, and about what kinds of people
are most open to these ideas. It seems that, according to one fairly crude
measure, many are INTP or ENTP, but that doesn't really tell us much. Also,
I worry about looking for simple criteria because I'd rather find ways of
*broadening* the appeal of extropian ideas to a wider range of personality
types, rather than only seeking those who already think in similar ways.
(Obviously there are limits to this; certain personality traits strongly
militate against openness to extropian ideas and attitudes, such as deep
fear and loathing of change.)

Birth order seems to be a terribly blunt instrument. I will divide the
population into only a very few categories, and so seems incapable of
telling us anything useful in terms of discovering proto-extropians, even if
it turns out that we are all third-born or whatever. And I seriously doubt
there is much of a pattern there anyway. Nor do I think technical
understanding will distinguish proto-extropians from others well, though it
will often be a factor that contributes to extropian sympathies.

We have different goals here.  I want to find out what we have in
common.  If it turns out that most of us (including me) aren't really
attracted to one of your "extropian ideas", then I'm not interested in
trying to broaden the appeal of that idea.

I don't think we can really hope to find much more than "factors that
contribute" at this stage.

Max More begins The Extropian Principles as follows:

> experience, diversity, opportunity, and growth.

Measure?  in what units?  Does this definition really say anything?  

> EXTROPIANISM -- The philosophy that seeks to increase extropy.

Assume you can measure all these things; why are we supposed to want 
to increase them?  I can understand increasing intelligence, vitality, and 
opportunity, but some of the others are problematic.  Why should we 
seek to increase experience per se, no matter what kind of experience 
it is?  Do you really want to increase diversity?  Does this mean you 
oppose the homogenization of cultures?  I suppose "energy" refers to 
energy available for use in the economy, and "growth" refers to 
economic growth.  Do you want to increase these, no matter what?  
Why is this axiomatic?  

Consider the expression "The philosophy that seeks to... "  

Does this mean that your metaphysics, your ontology, your logic, your 
philosophy of mind, your ethics, and your aesthetics will be determined 
by the need to increase the eight quantities that must be increased?  

Marx said "The point is not to understand the world, but to change it."  
This puts the cart before the horse.  The correct procedure is as follows:  
First one uses philosophy to ascertain the nature of the world; *then* 
one decides what should or should not be done.

Extropianism is certainly an interesting philosophy, and I sympathize
strongly with most aspects of it -- this is why I subscribed to
the mailing list.

But I don't get the conceptual connection of Libertarianism with
futuristic technology, complexity theory & spontaneous organization.

After all, is the State itself not a "spontaneous organization? --
a self-organized structure.  The State was not exactly set in place
from the outside, now was it -- it EMERGED, just like thought patterns
in a neural network, just like hexagonal rolls in a Benard cell,
etc. etc.

My belief is that while current government structures are in many ways
too restrictive, libertarianism would ALSO lead to an overly restrictive
system.  Free markets don't seem to stay "free" -- they seem to drift
into attractors consisting of MONOPOLIES or OLIGOPOLIES.  Look at the
software market, which is a free market, but is dominated by MicroSoft
to everyone's detriment.  What is needed is some kind of "institutionalization
of experimentation" -- some kind of overall structure to prevent the
spontaneous emergence of repressive governmental and corporate structures.
IN my opinion.  But this is a personal opinion which I do not claim to
have derived from scientific principles, mind you...

I think the question of the optimal social structure is an interesting
one, which is probably explorable by computer simulations along the 
lines of the commercial SimCity program.  I don't think that it is wise
to link one political persuasion (libertarianism) with hi technology
and freedom, to the exclusion of others.  Hasn't complexity science
taught us that things are not this simple??

That doesn't work either.  Even if we knew what is true, there isn't
any defensible way to infer from that what should be done.  To make
such an inference, one would have to have a reasonable inference rule
of the form "if X is true, then you should do Y"; I don't know of any
such inference rules that are universally accepted.  Suggestions are
welcome.  In the absence of such suggestions, Max's approach of
advocating doing things seems as good as anything.

However, I agree with you that he should not purport to measure things
without having a procedure that generates a number.  IMO he's really
peddling a value system; the religious right has "family values", and
we have analogous but different "extropian values", except Max calls
the extropian values "principles".

I look at this being a by-product of monetary system. Money originally
was what I'd call an "enabling technology". It filled a purpose,
namely enabling a freer flow of products and services. It has had a
down-side effect, namely that most things are now done for the sake of
making money. This is not particularly an efficient way to go about
doing things, and I would argue results in a lot of wasted time,
effort, and money. Problems may get solved, but if the solution was
such a good idea, why couldn't it have been achieved without money as
motivation?

I've been doing some writing recently on planned economies. The Soviet
Union was a good example of a planned economy gone wrong. Is a planned
economy workable at all? I'm not entirely convinced it isn't. I think
the major problem with the Soviet economy was that the control was too
fine grained. It's too complicated to try to design a system where
every aspect of the flow of money is controlled. The patterns are too
complex, there are too many interactions, and the act of controlling
those flows changes the flows themselves.

The economic system "in the West" could have been designed, but only
at a high level:

* Assume that a system of trade currently exists (e.g., barter)

* Create a token (physical) which represents some amount of work or
  product

* Have people accept the token as valid (this is the hard part
  initially)

* People can put a value (based in tokens) on any product or
  service they produce.

>From here, I would claim you could predict monopolies, slave labour,
misers, paid employment (as opposed to entrepreneurs), investment,
etc. It wouldn't predict interest per se, though if you got as far as
banks, you might come up with it.

In my "ideal planned economy", I would have several goals:

* guaranteed food and shelter (some how -- guaranteed doesn't
  necessarily mean that some benevolent government is
  involved. Extended families, as opposed to the more recent idea of
  the nuclear family, promote this sort of "social safety net")

* community-level money systems which augment a more socialist (in the
  true sense of the word) system. The exchange of goods for services,
  services for services, and goods for goods (i.e., barter) is very
  efficient

I think it's fairly obvious that the attitudes of people living in
such a system would be different from these we see today. The main
point I make with this is that the economy we have today has
essentially zero planning associated with it. As a society, we have no
common goals which drive us to do anything. And given the scale of the
economy we share, I don't think that's possible. Generating small
micro-economies where people involved have common goals may be an
"evolutionary stable strategy" (using Dawkins terms) to eventually
replace the existing economy. Communes, cooperatives, small
communities of people with common goals. I would suggest that the main
point is that if you want to achieve something, you need to plan for
achieving those goals, that it won't happen spontaneously *because* of
the complexity involved. In the existing economy we already have
examples of this happening, in the form of corporations, which act as
a micro-economy where the people involved work towards a common goal
(this doesn't say anything of whether those people really care for
what they are producing, and the "common goal" is more often than not
to make money -- try saying something else and get investment!)

I agree that monopolies and oligopolies are not desirable in many cases, 
but I would argue that oligopolies (based on merit, not unfair business 
practices) can sometimes be helpful.  For instance, it would not be 
desirable for software developers to have to write software which 
runs on and supports 50 different operating systems in order to get 
enough customers to make a profit.  Settling on a small number of 
operating systems made by only a few companies (or a single company in 
this case) reduces the amount of overhead required to get software out 
the door.

Agreed.  The overhead of a money based system isn't desirable.  
Unfortunately is seems that this is a necessary tradeoff in order to get 
the flexibility which money provides.

By "Extended families" do you mean the local community or do you simply 
mean blood-relatives that aren't as closely related as those in a nuclear 
family?  If it's the latter, how do you "plan" for an economy which 
encourages blood-relatives to be more willing to share food and shelter 
than they are now.

Barter?  It may be efficient in the sense that the handling of money is 
avoided, but this means that I would have to produce something which is 
wanted or needed by everyone which I want or need anything from.  In many 
fields, specialization is becoming more and more important because of 
the complexity involved in many tasks.  It would difficult to imagine 
how a brain surgeon would be able to trade his/her skills in order to 
buy toothbrushes, lawn mowers, and kitchen appliences.  Would this brain 
surgeon have to operate on the CEO of Sony in order to get a CD player?

It's true that there are many people (including me) who consider their 
career (or future career) to be a reward in and of itself.  It's also 
true that many organizations are able to foster a feeling of pride for 
the things that the organization produces and/or does.  However, there's 
a rather large number of people out there who perform their work simply 
for the "individual goal" of getting money so that they can enhance other 
areas of their lives.  It seems that these people wouldn't be working for 
a common goal.


Getting rid of the rather large overhead of a money-based economy is 
certainly a good goal, but it's important to make sure that the 
flexibility of money isn't given up in the process.  It's important that 
everyone be able to provide goods and services which can be traded for 
ANY other good or service.  Money is the intermediary which currently 
allows us to do this.

If I have misinterpreted your plan for a socialist economy please correct 
me.  I just don't see how the flexibility of money can be achieved without 
some form of intermediary which has no intrinsic value.

as a tool for the individual, not as an erector of social=20

Ben Goertzel:
After all, is the State itself not a "spontaneous organization? --
a self-organized structure.  The State was not exactly set in place
from the outside, now was it -- it EMERGED, just like thought patterns
in a neural network, just like hexagonal rolls in a Benard cell,
etc. etc.

My belief is that while current government structures are in many ways
too restrictive, libertarianism would ALSO lead to an overly restrictive
system.  Free markets don't seem to stay "free" -- they seem to drift
into attractors consisting of MONOPOLIES or OLIGOPOLIES.  Look at the
software market, which is a free market, but is dominated by MicroSoft
to everyone's detriment.  What is needed is some kind of
"institutionalization
of experimentation" -- some kind of overall structure to prevent the
spontaneous emergence of repressive governmental and corporate
structures.
IN my opinion.  But this is a personal opinion which I do not claim to
have derived from scientific principles, mind you...

I think the question of the optimal social structure is an interesting
one, which is probably explorable by computer simulations along the=20
lines of the commercial SimCity program. =20

Kurt Rongey:
To my mind, this all smacks Plato=92s _Republic_.  The point is, I'm

to resist having anybody=92s social structure imposed on me, no matter ho=

well-studied it is.  And another thing: Microsoft is not a monopoly. =20
Repeat.  Microsoft is not a monopoly.  I know, you didn=92t say explicitl=

that it was.  I just like to say that :)

Given, saying that something arises from un-spontaneous order is like
asserting that something in the universe is un-natural.  Perhaps we
should
look at Max=92s definition again, which goes beyond the literal meaning=20
of the 2 words:

Max More:
5. Spontaneous Order  =97 Supporting decentralized, voluntaristic social
coordination processes. Fostering tolerance, diversity, long-term
thinking,
personal responsibility, and individual liberty.

Kurt Rongey:
Once again, I think the aim here is to support the elimination of
barriers=20
to individual choice which arise from centralized, entrenched power=20
structures.  An individual, if aware of his own worth, will resist these
kinds of structures and will gravitate towards those which propose to
let him retain his autonomy.

Ben Goertzel:
I don't think that it is wise
to link one political persuasion (libertarianism) with hi technology
and freedom, to the exclusion of others.  Hasn't complexity science
taught us that things are not this simple??

Kurt Rongey:
I would say that freedom is in fact inextricably linked with political=20

which liberty is limited is the degree to which choices are limited=20
is the degree to which the individual suffers.  The degree to which
the choices of a researcher (vis a vis experimental techniques) is

the limitation and hampering of technological progress.  If there

Lyle, thanks for your feedback. The definitions, principles, and
explanations of Extropianism can always be improved.

>Measure?  in what units?  Does this definition really say anything?

Clearly it says a fair bit. It says, very basically, what extropy is and
thus what it is not. As a brief definition it does not purport to explain
the concept in depth. I have been torn between the virtues of brevity and
informativeness in the definition. When I explain the idea verbally, I
always expand on the definition, qualifying terms and ensuring the audience
understands that it=92s not intended as a techical term (it=92s not meant to=
 be
exactly the opposite of entropy either in a thermodynamic or a information
theoretic sense).

Despite the resulting incomplete precision, the brevity and simplicity of
the definition show their benefits in the typical reactions I've heard from
it. These are generally positive, and most people seem to get a ready grasp
of the basic idea right away.

An earlier definition I used described extropy as "the process of
increasing=85" rather than as a measure. Someone objected to that. I don=92t
recall their grounds, though I presume it was that extropy should be the
thing or collection of things being increased rather than the process=
 itself.

Perhaps "measure" is not the best term to use here. I am not attached to it
and welcome better suggestions. The term "measure" might imply, contrary to
what I want, that extropy is a techical term referring to exactly measurable
physical quantities. While it does refer to a collection of forces and
tendencies, *some* of which are (or in principle might be) exactly
measurable, overall it is not a thing that can be measured scientifically.

How about defining extropy as:

   "The extent of a person=92s or a culture=92s intelligence, information,
vitality, diversity,    opportunity, and personal growth."  [I=92ve recently
shortened the list of items to these.]

I removed "experience" because it=92s just too vague. As you rightly note,=
 why
should we seek to increase experience per se? Of course, that=92s not the
suggestion; it=92s experience of extropic kinds, but that would make the
definition partly circular. The idea behind "experience" was that gaining
more experience (through experimentation and longevity) leads to wisdom,
greater effectiveness, and so on. I dropped "energy" because it can be
subsumed by "vitality". The latter includes longevity and personal energy.

Diversity is a component of extropy that applies to societies. Diversity of
thinking, of approaches, does seem to be healthy for humans and transhumans.
Do I oppose the homogenization of cultures? Depends what you mean. When most
people say "homogenization of cultures" I take them to mean the way you can
find all kinds of ideas, philosophies, religions, political beliefs, ways of
doing things, etc. all within one geographical area, rather than each of
these being tied to its own location. If that=92s what is meant, I don=92t=
 have
a problem with such homogenization. Differing approaches and ideas still
continue, and their mutual criticism is actually likely to be enhanced by
their mutual proximity.

If you are asking if I oppose the flourishing of all cultures except one,
then yes. It=92s not the kind of thing I can really actively oppose, but I
would be disturbed to see this kind of cultural homogenization, unless,
maybe (and unbelievably!) it was the result of the destruction of almost all
cultures due to effective rational criticism.

No, it refers to personal energy primarily, though the increasing
intelligence, information, and related production that extropians seek is
likely to require ever more energy. (Try going to the stars on a small
energy budget.) "Growth" also refers to personal growth. Since that may not
have been clear, I=92ve lengthened the definition by adding the qualifier.
It=92s still shorter than the old definition.

No. Extropianism has never claimed or sought to be a complete philosophy.
It=92s a set of attitudes and values that involve seeking the things listed=
 in
the definition. I believe that the best way to live according to those
values is to recognize reality, rather than imposing our preconceptions on
it. The philosophy of Extropianism seeks to explain the desirability of
these values and to encourage more people to reject indefensible and exitial
(destructive to life) beliefs in favor of extropic attitudes.

Why not?  Why settle for anything less?

I'm not sure "mystical" is the word I would use, but I agree that 
evolution does have a purpose, and his way of expressing it 
is the best I have seen.  I might amend it as follows:  The aim of 
human evolution is to attain a complete vision of the universe, in which 
all causal relations are manifest, down to the roots of causality.

Why is this "domination" (= great success in the market) to everyone's
detriment. I don't agree. I think there's currently a good mix of very tough
competition and standard setting enabled by the Microsoft-Intel alliance on
one side, and the Apple-Motorola alliance on the other. It's unfortunate
that the folks at Apple weren't better business people, as I'd like to keep
the pressure on Microsoft. Fortunately the opening of the Net has created a
huge area that's keeping the competitive pressure on Microsoft.

It's interesting to note that Microsoft just announcing that they are
opening the standard for ActiveX. They want to create an independent group
to set standards and accessibility. The competition from Netscape, Sun and
others led them to this move that will be wonderfully preventive of monopoly
problems. If Microsoft really can do what they want without caring about the
market, they would't bother with this unusual and encouraging move.

Do you really think the software market would function better if the
government decided what products could be made, by whom, and how much they
could be sold for? (After a few years in the govt. agency's committees...)

Upward and Outward!

The claim of spontaneous order is that if things repeatedly reorganize
and compete among themselves, the resulting order is likely to be
"good" in some sense.  States are too long lived; their current
configuration is determined by their initial configuration and
internal politics more than by competition among different states.
For instance, most US citizens haven't considered moving to other
countries, so the US isn't being forced to compete with other
countries to provide a desirable living environment.  (Maybe the US is
providing the best living environment, or maybe it isn't; that's not
my point.  My point here is that most people born and raised in the US
haven't seriously compared it to other alternatives.)

States are like DOS - a stable standard that is there for historical
reasons, not because anybody would choose it now.  After enough time
passes, they'll become less relevant, just as the latest version of
Windows NT can't run all DOS programs and I don't care if Linux can
run all DOS programs.  With advancing communications technology, the
evolution of these organizations speeds up, so the state ages faster.

You could have an intermediary which does have intrinsic value and
therefore isn't so easily inflatable.  Gold coins, shares in mutual
funds, or corn futures might all work.

You seem to have dropped "Onward!" from your .sig in exchange for "Upward 
and Outward!"  Did you decide that "Onward!" was too limited in the 
range of movement that it implied?  *smile*

How about "Onward, Upward and Outward!" instead?  That would cover the three 
standard dimensions that we can move freely in.

The August '96 issue of Wired says that "the US is built on a US$7 
trillion economic engine, only $300 billion of which is in cash."
What will happen when cash is replaced by private cash cards (cards which 
use encryption to allow private transfer of electronic cash which exists 
only as bits on the cash card).  Would these bits still have to mean 
something?  Would the government still have to say how much money exists 
in "cash" even if that cash is only made up of bits?

Here are the important properties of the pieces of green paper we
carry in our wallets that I can think of offhand.  Additions are
welcome; I hope to learn something here.

1. Supply is limited.  Only the government can counterf..., er, print
   more of them in significant quantities in practice, and there are
   political repurcussions that keep them from doing that too freely.
2. They are good for paying taxes and many existing debts and contracts, such
   as mortgages, cable bills, phone bills, etc.
3. They are more-or-less freely exchangeable.
4. They are durable enough that they probably won't become unusable
   while they're in my pocket.

Does money have to have any other properties?  Whether it's green
paper or bits seems unimportant.  Checking account balances have most
of the above properties, except the bank gets to do controlled amounts
of counterfeiting too (the sum of the account balances generally
far exceeds the money the bank has on hand).

The vast majority of money is bits already.  Most people don't have
most of their wealth as green paper; it's in account balances and
equity of various kinds.

During that time, only the "should not be done"s will be accomplished.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

On Thursday I made a pledge that I will give $1000 a year for 10 years to the 
Prometheus Project. The idea behind the project is to start a profit  making 
company and obtain one million dollars a year for 10 years " for the  purpose 
of doing the scientific research necessary to convincingly  demonstrate and 
publish in peer reviewed journals, fully reversible brain cryopreservation". 
We're already up to $209,000 a year for 10 years and have been  looking for 
money for less than a month.   
 
I have always thought that Nanotechnology would be needed for reversible  
brain  cryopreservation, but too many people I respect think otherwise for me  
to ignore the possibility that something much simpler might work. Although  
small by some standards this would be the largest research project ever 
undertaken in this area, the largest by far. The low hanging fruit has not  
been picked yet, so Interesting things will certainly be found, and if the  
goal is actually reached the  world will never be the same. 
 
I can't imagine ever regretting this decision, if it works I'll be rather  
proud of myself for helping, and I might even make some money, gaining  
immortality wouldn't be too bad either. If the goal is not reached at least I  
won't be tormented with the thought that it failed because people like me had  
no interest in it.

ExI also has some melatonin for sale. It's currently $9.50 for a bottle of
60, or $16 for 2 bottles. Add $3.50 any size order. 

However, to compete with VRP, I'm offering a 25% discount to readers of this
list, or 30% if you're an ExI member.

We'll also be excerpting Dr. Ray Sahelian's new book on DHEA in Extropy #17
(production of which is nearing the finishing line).

We also have Dr. Walford's Interactive Diet Planner for $95 = $3 shipping.
I'll offer that for only $85, or $80 for members for a limited time only
(I've always wanted to say that!). This program runs on Windows (3.1 or 95)

Upward and Outward!

This is really David's question to answer, but I believe it is the same
version of Majordomo or close enough not to matter. The address is
extropians-request@extropy.org

This info was in David's welcome message just a few days ago, but it seems
that quite a few people never read it.

David: Perhaps you could post the instructions for joining, leaving, and
changing address, along with a list of Majordomo commands, as Hara Ra suggested.

Not sure this is very on-topic but it struck me as hilarious but sad:

I was watching the 100M women's race. The winner (whose name I forget but
who was on the American team) was interviewed right after her victory. What
did this "fastest woman in the world" have to say? She said:

        "The first person I want to thank is God."

Somebody wake me when we're living in a modern world.

I do have a complete philosophy, or at least a philosophy that aims at
completeness, and Extropianism is a subset of it. I like to refer to the
more complete system as...
Maxism.

I've always resisted the idea that Extropianism should aim to be a total
philosophy. For one thing, it worried me. It's okay for me to have a
complete (but revisable) personal philosophy, but I'm concerned that a total
public philosophy is likely to suffer a hardening of the orthodoxies, as
R.A.W. would say. Maybe that's not necessarily the case, so long as the
philosophy declares itself open to revision. That was clearly *not* the case
with Rand's view of Objectivism. She insisted that either you accepted all
of her statement of Objectivism or none of it. (It was logically derived
from axiomatically certain premises, and apparently she was incapable of
error in her logic or the facts they worked on.) Even if a philosophy
declares itself to be open, I suspect that a total philosophy is more open
to abuse than one that stays limited in scope, like Extropianism. I'd be
very interested to hear other people's views on this.

Secondly, in terms of memetic propagation, if you insist on packing in such
a vast array of attitudes, values, and beliefs into a single philosophical
package, it seems to me that you will limit its appeal (at least to
independent-minded people -- the kind I'm interested in). Extropianism
already limits itself by including a favoring of free markets and
spontaneous order (though it does *not* require anyone to be a hardcore
libertarian to call themselves an Extropian). That's a tradeoff I decided to
make. There can and will be other versions of transhumanism that appeal to
statist-minded people.

I think spontaneous order is an especially tough one for people to grasp.
Any help ExI can give in getting people to understand it will probably be
appreciated by the other organizations and individuals who recognize its
importance to a healthy and vigorous economy and polity.

I agree. Besides, as I noted in my reply to Lyle, Extropianism does not
attempt to be a complete philosophy. The Principles say nothing specifically
about pancritical rationalism. Personally, I think PCR extremely fitting
with the general extropian emphasis on critical thinking, experimentation,
anti-dogmatism, etc. However, someone might just as well have come to
Extropian conclusions on the basis of a different approach, including the
Objectivist axiomatic approach.

I agree and think that as the years go by we will see a growing number who
hold themselves to be Extropian or extropian but who aren't especially
technically knowledgeable. Clearly, since many of our discussions in the
existing forums involve technology, we tend to attract those who are
technically sophisticated, or philosophically sophisticated. I suspect that
there are more extropian types to be found involved with tech, especially
exciting, rapidly advancing tech. Promethean minded people often find these
areas attractive.

I enjoyed and appreciated your comments Kurt.

Subject: Are extropians "BUFFs"?
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

HelLO everyone.

I seem to be a reactivated playing piece.

Just read a day's worth of messages about the meaning of Extropianism.

My feeling is that too many specifiers narrow the specification.
In other words, to broaden the appeal of Extropianism, it might help
to simplify its description.

Right now, the closest thing to a central principle is "extropy," a word
that, well, doesn't make me salute every time I hear it.  I mention it
because Max seems to find it central; maybe if he were to anchor
Extropianism, that would be where.  But I would point to the people who
become lower-case "e" extropians.  My simplification is that we're
"Bottom-Up Fast Futurists," or BUFFs.

Now, I'm stretching these terms to stand for slightly more complicated
ideas.

"Bottom-Up" means we see history as good ideas, technologies, opportunities,
happening locally and spreading.  Notice I packed technophilia and
optimism in there.  Also, interest in libertarianism and spontaneous
order (see my P.S. to Ben below) and memes and such are close by.  Also,
there's a difference from the planning- and statistical-trend- and
grand-vision-driven sorts of futurism.  Another part of being bottom-up
is seeing oneself as part of the process.

"Fast Futurist" means someone who sees big change happening so fast that
the future is personally relevant, as opposed to a place where "future
generations" will live.  We see ourselves in the future.

Allow me to go through the wonderful BEST DO IT SO catechism:

Boundless Expansion -- Uninterest in limits.  See Dynamic Optimism.

Self Transformation -- This is seeing oneself there.  Part of being bottom-
up is seeing oneself as a system, not a given for the world to be built
around.  Also, the Fast Future happens in my lifetime, so I'd better steer.

Dynamic Optimism -- Partly a difference from doomsaying, which looks at
trends, and threats to existing orders.  Bottom-up looks at opportunities.
The difference from smug optimism? maybe just the techie (=materialist?)
orientation, and the fact that things are happening Fast and Bottom-Up
(out of control), and that we're personally going to be involved.

Intelligent Technology -- just another technology, but it undercuts the
centrally-planned-home-for-future-generations-of-humans picture.  And it's
a good example of a Bottom-Up Fast Future right in our faces and under our
fingers.

Spontaneous Order -- A better word for bottom-up, but who wants to be a SOFF?

My extrapolation from personal experience is that extropians are people who
got used to seeing in a BUFF way.  The idea of a "personality type" is
somewhat anti-ST, un-DO.  Rather, the way we were seeing it then
(late 20th) at least, Extropianism seemed like a good idea at the time.

Good things and bad things (including things that reduce freedom)
happen within freedom.  But overall more freedom means more good vs. bad.
Bad things and things that reduce freedom tend to be symbiotic.  For
instance, scratch a monopoly and you'll find it relying on state power.
So, it's bad overall to reduce freedom *just because some bad things--
even unfreedom--happen within it.*

But even if you're not convinced, the Libs and complexity theorists and
other Spontaneous Orderphiles often find each other's ideas sympathetic.

	This brings up a serious question.  Can a person with a scientific
mind set ever have the "certainty" that seems to be required for peak
performance in many fields of endeavor?

	Religious "faith" is the most common approach to the "need" for
certainty.  I am not talking about the "comforting" aspects of "certainty"
and "faith", but the apparent advantages in "programming" behaviour be it
athletics, business, career...stiving of any and all sorts!

I have trouble grasping its centrality myself.  So I might be a good
person for folks to try out their arguments for it, though email
probably isn't the best forum for this type of thing.  Sounds like a
fun conversation though.

Kurt Rongey:
It would seem that the Christian attitude toward goals is that "I'll do
it 
through the grace of God, if it is His will."  What this accomplishes
for 
the aspiring olympic runner is eradication of any need to acknowledge
the
possibility of failure.  "God will be there no matter what happens, and 
all I have to do is work hard and he'll take care of the rest."  This is 
especially true of people operating to fulfill the potential of a
genetic 
(read God-given) "talent",  as one finds with olympic athletes.

This kind of motivational abandon seems on the surface incompatible with
any belief system that restricts itself to reason.  In addition, I think 
that the Extropian mainstream view of "certainty" is not a positive
one.  
All is theoretical, and theories are subject to alteration due to 
differing experimental results.

Do we have to abandon reason in order to abandon uncertainty?  If so,
does
a rational philosophy hamper achievement?

I'm interested to know what techniques people have used to free 
themselves from the thought of failure without "divine assistance," and 
thereby achieved extraordinary goals.  Anybody have any favorite 
techniques?  The faith-in-God one works pretty well.  Too bad there's no 
God.

Basic philosophy.  Actually maybe Max would insist on more than this,
but one good reason I could give for emphasizing SO is that most people
don't get it.  When people look at order they usually look up for te
source -- where's the watchmaker?  It's only since Adam Smith and then
Darwin that we've realized structures can spring up from simpler
origins and thus done away with the need for the Deist God.  So SO
doesn't have to mean we have to do everything in a self-organizing

True, often they don't stay free because  armed men, called "governments", 
put a gun to your head, or threaten to, and force you to make economic 
decisions you would never do of your own free will. The result is that the 
only really free market is the black market, fortunately this seems to be 
taking up a larger and larger share of the economy.

I think it's odd that people worry so much about the bad things that a  
corporation might do someday, but ignore the HUGE evil that countries have 
actually done. Companies may sometimes be rough with their competition and  
be rude to their employees and customers, but then don't put millions of 
people in death camps and then shove them into ovens.

I don't think your worries about monopolies are well founded because the only  
successful cartels in history are the ones that have government support. No  
need to pass laws against monopolies, the market will stop them automatically:
                 

  Your company and mine produce all the steel made in the world. We make a   
  good profit now, but we want more, so we get together and double our prices.   
  Now we each make a huge profit on each ton of steel sold, so we would both   
  like to make lots and lots of steel. However, because the price of steel is   
  now very high demand is down, so part of our sinister plot must be an   
  agreement to limit production. The higher the price gets, the greater is the   
  temptation to secretly cheat on the agreement and produce more steel than   
  was agreed to, and that would kill the cartel.

  There are even more problems for our poor cartel. Now that the price of   
  steel is sky high and the profits are huge, other companies will want to   
  get in on the act and start making steel.  Also, consumers of steel will   
  not want to shell out all that money for that metal and will start looking   
  for replacement materials like wood or plastic or aluminum or composite   
  fiber. 
                 

No need to pass laws to protect the little guy, the market will do that 
automatically too:


  I manufacture 99% of the worlds widgets, you make 1% . I want to drive you   
  out of business, so I figure I'll lower my price until you go broke and then 
  I can jack them up to anything I want. So now you lose money on each widget 
  you sell, the trouble is I do to. I have 99 times as much money as you do,
  but I'm losing it 99 times faster. Even worse, because the price is very 
  low, the demand for widgets is huge, and if prices are to remain low I must 
  build more factories and increase production. I'm losing money faster and 
  faster,  meanwhile you just temporally halt production in your small factory 
  and wait for me to go broke. It won't be a long wait.                    
  

OK I will admit that one type of monopoly, called a "natural monopoly" would  
work in a free market, but they don't bother me. In a few, very rare 
instances, the most efficient size of a factory is so big that there is only  
room for one, the best example is aluminum production. A larger steel mill is  
not more efficient than a smaller one, it's just bigger, but for physical  
reasons that's not true for an aluminum plant, the bigger the better.

However even a natural monopoly is limited to what it can do. If they rase  
prices too high a competitor with a smaller factory will step in. The small  
factory is not as efficient as the big one, but by accepting a smaller profit  
margin they can still charge less for aluminum than the big company. And of 
course, there is always the competition from other materials. 

This logic did not phase the US government when in it's infinite wisdom it  
decided to break up Alcoa Aluminum. What dreadful crime had Alcoa committed?  
The government said it had kept competitors out. What dastardly method did  
Alcoa use to do this? The government said Alcoa used the most advanced 
technology available to produce Aluminum that was just too cheap for  
competitors to match. How very dreadful! I wish I was joking about this, but  
I am not. If you can't beat them in the market place, lobby the government to  
send in their goons to destroy your competition.

                >dominated by MicroSoft to everyone's detriment. 


Everybody loves to hate Microsoft, perfectly understandable, large 
concentrations of power make people uncomfortable, but the ONLY way to 
prevent  it is if there is an even larger concentration of power to put it 
out of business. The software industry is beyond doubt the fastest growing, 
most productive part of the world economy, but could it do even better? Sure 
it could, nothing is perfect, not even the free market, but can you really 
tell me with a straight face that the "help" of government bureaucrats would 
make  this sector of the economy grow even faster?

Just how "detrimental" is Microsoft anyway? 

I've cursed at DOS just like everybody else, and I've looked at the Apple  
system with some envy. So why isn't Apple the world standard instead of  
fighting for it's life?

I think it boils down to 2 things, the free market is not perfect and 
standards are hard to change. No point in denying it, the market is not 
perfect, but then neither are regulators, and it's ridicules to claim that a 
gaggle of politicians and bureaucrats are smarter, or more honest than market 
forces. Yes, standards are resistant to change, but that's OK because that is 
exactly what a standard should do. The lack of popularity of the  Apple  
operating system is not an example of market failure because in the context 
of the real world it is in fact an inferior system. If everything  else was 
equal Apple  would be better than DOS\Windows but everything else is not 
equal. The Apple system has some small technical advantages but that is 
countered by enormous practical disadvantages, it will not operate on the  
type of computer most people have and it will not  run billions of dollars 
worth of popular software. It's perfectly valid to take such things into  
account when deciding what system is really superior.  

When a standard is set it's just not worth going to a new one unless you get 
an astronomical improvement. That's why we still use feet, yards and pounds 
even though the metric system is better.  The market has decided that the 
Apple is not a huge advance that was worth the trouble of conversion, it 
could be wrong about that, but I think the  market has a better understanding  
of such things than a bunch of hack  politicians.

Whatever this  "institutionalization" is it will have to be far larger and 
far more powerful than any corporation and that is a recipe for repression, 
it is also a recipe for poverty. We can design an airliner so we can make it  
fly in any direction we want just by moving a few controls, can we do the 
same thing with an economy and point it in the direction of prosperity? No,
because nobody can understand the economy in which they live, the more they  
understand it the more they change it. Airliners are ridiculously simple  
machines compared a human being, and a human being is a ridiculously simple   
machine compared to a modern healthy economy.        

You can control a plane because it has an enormous mass compared to air,  and 
it's moving at an enormous speed, and drag will not slow it to a stop because 
it has an enormous engine, so it's easy to make a prediction about how the 
plane will behave when the control surfaces are in a particular orientation. 
Also, when you learn more about the airplane that doesn't cause the plane to 
change. The idea that an equivalent economic machine could be built and that 
our fearless leader could  just "point and shoot" it in the direction of 
prosperity  and  provide individual freedom as a bonus is just plain loony.                 

We don't need the State, Anarchy is very workable, (just look at the Internet)  
its the best way to get things done. It's true that large projects can't be 
accomplished without good organization, but government is not the only way to 
get organized, or the best. A command economy, the kind governments like, is 
inherently inefficient. If you doubt this just look at the pitiful situation 
in Eastern Europe. Even if we make the ridiculous assumption that all 
politicians are honest and have boiling water IQ's they could never do as 
good a job as the free market because they are lacking a vital ingredient, 
price information. The true price of an object is determined by an enormous 
number of variables and is much too complicated to be calculated from first 
principles, but the market will tell you what the price should be, no trouble 
at all.  Whenever you change jobs, travel or make a purchase you are casting 
a vote and sending an exquisitely sensitive message to the economy to change 
in a way you want. In a Democracy all you can do is vote for a grab bag of 
promises every 4 years.

Certainly not!
But I resent being presented with a forced-choice between 20'th
century "free market" capitalist "democracy" and Soviet-style
state socialism (state capitalism, some would say).

I am in favor of decentralization, and am interested in the possibility
of new social/cultural systems emerging which lack both the centralized
control of the Soviet system and the centralized corporate control
of the current US system.

I understand that the expansion of something like Microsoft software
is a natural phenomenon -- it's what the economists call "increasing
returns" (rather than the textbook "decreasing returns").  The more
you sell, the more you gain "mind share" as well as market share,
and the more other software vendors write software only compatible
with your stuff.  Positive feedback!!  

The spread of MicroSoft software is much like the spread of a
foreign bacterium in the human body.  A healthy body has an immune
system which keeps any substance (internal or external) from rising
to an excessive level.  One can imagine a social system which had similar
internal, self-organizing mechanisms acting to keep things decentralized,

This is a funny claim, though, isn't it?  You are defining large-basined
attractors of social dynamical systems as "good."  

To make sense of this statement, you would need to define "good" in
some other way, and then argue that there is in fact some reason why
large-basined attractors of social systems are good.

Otherwise, it doesn't make much sense to me.

>most people born and raised in the US haven't seriously compared

I am an American who has lived in two foreign countries, Australia and
NEw Zealand -- neither one drastically different from the US, but
different in many ways.  Certainly, compared to the US, these are bot
h "democratic socialist" countries: you've got "the dole" for that
percentage who don't want to work, you've got national healthcare,
extremely high taxes, etc.  The welfare state is just about complete,
although the state does NOT own the means of production.

But, really, so what?  We're talking about drastic changes in 
technology which are expected to lead to drastic changes in society.
What makes you think that any existing governmental system -- or any
governmental system we have even THOUGHT about -- will still have
meaning in 200 years time.

I believe we need to think much more creatively about this stuff --
myself included.  I don't believe in spontaneous order as you have
outlined it, nor do I believe that the governmental systems we have now
are anywhere near a fair statistical sample of the overall space of
such systems.  

Some of the attractors of the social dynamical systems are "good", others
may be persistent but bad, like delusional belief systems of individuals.
It is up to us to guide ourselves -- collectively -- toward the better
attractors ... and to decide what we mean by "better"..

I agree that government price-fixing is doomed to fail due to the complexity
of the economy.

But, think about how the market works.  It is like a system of nonlinear
simultaneous equations -- it determines the "correct" price for item X,
based on the prices for items Y, Z, etc.; and based on the culture of
the society in questions (which determines the average, variance, etc.
of the psychology of the individuals in the society).

We all know that a system of nonlinear simultaneous equations can have
MORE THAN ONE SOLUTION.  The market finds ONE OF THEM -- which is better
than state price-fixing does.  But I do not believe that the price-level
attractor found by a market is necessarily "good" just because it is a
moderately wide-basined attractor of some dynamical system in price
space.  

Economic theory is just now emerging from a century or more of linear
thinking.  If we accept that the economy is best modeled as a nonlinear
system (a complex system) then we have to accept that there may be
MANY DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS to problems such as 
	-- pricing a given collection of goods in a given society
	-- organizing a society to as to maximize productivity,
		opportunity, standard of living [fill in your favorite
		goals here]

And we have to ask: are the solutions that happen to get converged to
necessarily the BEST ones?  To assume that they are, which seems to be
the line of John Clark and some others on this listserver, is just a
variation on Pangloss with his "This is the best of all possible worlds."
What you are saying is "In a complex system, whatever attractor we happen
to sink into most often is the best one."  WHY?  WHY?  WHY?

I think so, but you have to temporarily leave the analytic/sceptic way of
thinking. It is a great tool to use to orient oneself, but slightly
limiting when you have set your course and want to DO it. Always finding
new possibilities and evaluating them reduces our mental focus, sometimes
we have to "be one" with the task, and just do it. 

I borrow mental tricks from various religions and ideologies, or make them
up myself. For example, I have found that chanting a nonsense mantra is
quite helpful to do some feats of strength or stamina. 

Another way would be to carefully think about your major goals in life,
analyse how they can be achieved, think about what these subgoals mean and
how they can be achieved, and so on until you see manageable tasks before
you (today I'm going to read up on biochemistry so I can get closer to my
exam so I can get my Ph.D in nanotechnology so I can help develop the
nanomachines I need to become immortal). And this way you also *feel' that
what you do moves you forward towards your great goals.

On the other hand, the wording seems to imply that extropy is=20

complexity theory is still struggling with finding a good definition of=20

Why not? I have begun to dislike reification (=3D turning concepts into=20

If you can train yourself to become a temporary moron, you can have the
advantages of faith and sceptical thinking when you are not moron. But for
some applications, long term work is required, and then you have to be a
moron for a long time to keep motivated. That is harder. 

Perhaps we will need some true believers in the Church of Transhumanism 
to really get started...

The posting about the Olympic runner reminded me of a question I had been
wanting to ask. What is the real US reaction to the recent terrorist
activity at the Olympics? Our press portrys your public as having a shocked
'how could it happen here' attitude and a growing paranoia over the 'enemy
within'. Is this the case?

Also, given that these terrorists seem to come from anti-government
factions (albeit violent and extreme ones) should those who hold
Libertarian/Extropian/Anarco views be concerned that the media will begin
to 'tar them with the same brush'?

The honest scientist will not claim certainty about what is true, but
I don't see anything that keeps him or her from having certainty about
what to do next.  The two are not very tightly coupled.

On the other hand, I can't imagine what would make me dedicate a
sizeable chunk of my life to be the fastest human to run 100M, when so
many people with relatively little trouble have acquired an automobile
that can go much faster for longer distances.  I wouldn't expect a
person who finds such a boneheaded way to go 100M in a hurry to have
anything resembling a scientific mind.

I think the press colors the incidents and the reactions for the best dramatic effect rather than being concerned with accuracy. While the victims and their families may certainly feel shocked, I think the public at large feels it is somewhat distant from their everyday lives. Nobody at work is even talking about. People have lot more resiliency than the media ever give them credit for. Besides terrorism is really nothing new here. Remember the Boston Tea Party. The assasination/attempted assisinations of several presidents, the Weathermen in the 70's, the Ku Klux Klan, the World trade Center bombing, the Kansas City bombing, the list goes on and on. All these things meet the definition of terrorism as put forth by William Session, former director of the FBI - "violence or the threat of violence to further political or social goals'. The only difference is the international character of some of the violence

Frequently governments use the promise of security as means of increasing their power base. Sometimes this works; sometimes not. In the case of the 'War on Drugs' it worked quite well - to a point. There is now considerable backlash because of this. My guess is that any push toward totalitarianism will result in a greater backlash whatever the media position. Nonetheless, there will be additional legislation that limits individual freedom in the name of fighting terrorism. This is more worthy of concern then the media's portrayal.

Cute name.  It would be neat seeing it in the title of a book, and
watching everyone walk by it in the bookstore and think it was a typo
on the cover of a communist rant.

How do you jump the is/ought barrier?

For those who may not already know, here's a description of the
barrier: Perhaps one can come up with a reasonable guess about what is
true, but even with perfect knowledge of what is true, it is far from
obvious how to convert this to a decision about what to do next.  The
"is/ought barrier" is this logical gap between what "is" and anything
having to do with planning personal or group action.

I jump it by taking the premise that I choose to try to do things that
have consequences interesting to me.  Each action has a chain of
consequences, and I want the consequences of my actions to go off
toward the future as far as I can forsee without them becoming boring.
Thus, for instance, I generally try to avoid doing things that would
kill me, since my death would lop off a giant bunch of interesting
consequences.  It might not lop off all of the interesting
consequences of things I have done, since, for instance, somebody in
the future might conceivably read my thesis and do something useful
with it.  (Ha!)  

This strategy of leaping the barrier would also have worked a few
hundred years ago when personal death was obviously inevitable, if my
descendants, my peers, or my intellectual works had some plausible
chance of being at the beginning of an infinite interesting chain of
consequences.

Answers to this question from people other than Max are interesting
too.

Yes, and I agree with what you went on to say about the importance of
keeping your immediate goals in the context of your major long term goals.

There seems to be an assumption in this discussion that believing in a God
will make a person more successful and that we need to find rational ways of
achieving the same effect. I think there are ways of achieving extreme
focus, but I seriously doubt that believing in a God helps much. When the
runner said "the first person I want to thank is God", she was simply
interpreting her victory in terms of her religious beliefs. She didn't see
how utterly absurd this was (why should God favor her?). The fact that she
interpreted the result that way is not evidence that her belief helped her
win. How would her belief help? If she believes her winning is inevitable
because God is on her side, she might actually train less hard. Someone who
believes it's up to them, and believes that they *can* win through maximum
effort, seems to have a better chance (other things being equal).

I don't doubt that there will some tasks that religious people will do
better, like sacrificing their lives for a cause, but I don't envy them for
that.

Over the years I've collected quite a variety of techniques for boosting
motivation and the winning mentality. I'll be explaining some of them in my
Dynamic Optimism seminar in September. Eventually I'll have them in written
form.

I don't think that's what John said, and it's not what I said. Free markets
may not choose the *best* result, but they do choose results that are better
than will be chosen by any other known system. Furthermore, I don't see any
way of determining what a good result is other than through the free choices
of individuals contracting with one another.

Since you are not proposing centralized control, what exactly are you
proposing as an alternative? Things like better informed and more rational
consumers and producers certainly would make the market work better, but
that is not an *alternative* to spontaneous order/free markets.

It might be wise to read an entire post before you comment on it. I'll give  
you the Readers Digest Condensed Version, the main theme of my post was that  
the free market is NOT perfect, just the best instrument we have. The correct  
price for a mass market object is the maximum amount that most people are 
willing to pay for it. If this price is less than the cost to manufacture and 
distribute it, then there is no point in making it at all, nobody wants it 
very badly. The market finds this price not by solving simultaneous equations 
but by experiment, with modern commutations it might not find the perfect 
price but it can come very close.

In other words a society governed by the free market is not as good as one  
lead by somebody who is infinitely wise, infinitely knowledgeable, and 
infinitely good. Well, I think that is perfectly true, the only trouble is, 
although  there are plenty of leaders who claim to posses these wonderful 
attributes, those who actually do in fact have these qualities are in rather
short supply.

Capitalism yes, but few on this list have anything good to say about

Sounds like you've been reading Brian Arthur. His idea of "increasing returns" 
is that positive feedback can be important in economics, small things can  
lead to huge changes, and popularity alone can lead to even more popularity.  
For example, a century ago for no very good reason, somebody made a QWERTY 
typewriter and today nearly every keyboard on the planet is a QWERTY, even  
though it is not the most efficient layout. I think Arthur is a very bright  
fellow and his increasing returns idea has a lot of validity, but I part  
company with him when he uses it to justify government regulation.
                  
His argument boils down to 2 things, the free market is not perfect and 
standards are hard to change. Both points are true but neither can justify 
Big Brother using coercion to stop the Microsoft\Intuit  merger, as he 
maintains. I agree that the free market is not perfect, but then, perfection 
never enters into the realm of real world economics, regulators are not 
perfect either. And yes, it's difficult to tell when the time is right to 
change a standard, and yes, politicians are not nearly smart enough to make 
that decision.

I don't understand what prevents this mysterious regulatory mechanism from  
falling victim to the same "increasing returns" and "positive feedback" you  
so fear, especially when you consider that even at the start it MUST be more  
powerful than Microsoft if it is to have any hope of regulating it.

Didn't the "Natural Law" people solve this? Of course, you'd have to
employ a "scientific" view of "is" which reminds you that an identity
could be wrong, and is almost certainly incomplete. Can't remember
how they solved it, though.

I should have explained this point more -- I don't expect most people
to start living with their parents, aunts, uncles, siblings,
etc. Communes came close to the idea of a modern extended
family. Their informalness made them fairly unworkable (I'm referring
to my stereotypical image of a '60s hippie commune -- many of today's
squatter "communities" have similar organizational problems).

This brings me back to the idea of communities, which at one time (I
believe) tended to be more supportive of individuals within those
communities. This is in contrast to many suburban neighbourhoods where
people may never meet their next-door neighbours. With the ever
expanding communications technology available to us, the number of
"real" communities a person is involved with, communities which can
provide aid in times of need, increases from the one or two physical
communities available to most people. I would call these (to continue
overusing a word) "virtual" communities.

Well, beyond the fact that I wouldn't feel comfortable with a brain
surgeon performing their art so they can buy a CD player, I never
really suggested using barter to replace money, merely that money
should play a less important role in people's lives than it does
now. This relates directly towards the changing nature of work, and
that we are moving into an economy where most work is dull and
wasteful. Most products and services in the marketplace are an
artifact of this.

Money is a very useful abstraction. But that's all it is. Our society
has made money it's centre, and this I see is the main problem. Most
of my thinking on the subject is redesigning (or subverting) aspects
of the economy in order to make play (instead of work) the centre. The
most important thing I see is a need for a change of attitude.

And as we move further into an economy where these people's jobs
become automated or just disappear, where employment requirements are
declining, where the buying power of the average person is declining,
I have to wonder how long it is before they start realizing that life
is for living. I'm also lucky in that the work I'm good at is one
which I enjoy, and it gives me a decent standard of living. I'm also
in one of the few sectors of the changing economy which is likely to
stay around for awhile. But then I have other interests for which no
one would pay me, that I can't spend as much time on as I'd like. This
saddens me...

I dislike the term "socialist economy", mostly because years of indoctrination have a pretty good stranglehold on some part of my brain. The flexibility of money is a good thing. I have a problem with the direction we (as a society) have let money take us
. Finding alternatives is only possible if we have a clear picture of where we want to get to. It's those alternatives and discussion of them which interest me the most...

I don't care for Microsoft's products, and in general I don't use them, but
I don't feel that Microsoft's domination of the software market is at all
to my detriment. Microsoft's domination simply means that all of
Microsoft's competitors have to produce products that are better than
Microsoft's if they expect to keep a piece of the market. This doesn't hurt
me at all.

I doubt that useful computer simulations of society will be available until
sometime after we are able to produce useful computer simulations of human
brains. Human brains are not only far more complex than anything we've ever
been able to usefully simulate, but they also have a tremendous causal
impact on the development of society.  ;)

The question of the optimal social structure is explorable primarily by the
study of history, a fact that futurist technophiles are often prone to
overlook.

As for your assertion about MONOPOLIES and OLIGOPOLIES, if you study the
monopolies that one finds in history, they were generally either a result
of government prohibition against their competitors or else were harmless
and temporary, like the brief Alcoa monopoly on aluminum production earlier
this century.

Perhaps because it's not available yet, and will be a long time in the
building. Perhaps because some of us view "philosophy" as just a short-hand
name for "the set of all research programs we don't have a solid handle on
yet", and because some of us expect that this set will never be reduced to
the empty set.

Human beings have diverse purposes, but I see no evidence that the cosmos
has a purpose. To attribute a single purpose to cosmic evolution is IMHO an
inaccurate anthropomorphism.

I doubt that your "complete vision" is attainable, because such a complete
vision would have to make manifest all causal relations *including* the
causal chains that pass through the internals of the people "having" the
complete vision. By the time we have a complete understanding of all causal
relations in the physical world, in the human brain, and in the evolution
of human cultures, I'm sure we'll have developed the ability to perceive
and think about even more complex structures which we cannot even imagine
at this point.

In order to understand and explain things, we develop new conceptual
resources. But those conceptual resources themselves are structures within
brains which have causal effects on the world which in turn need to be
explained. Even if physics has a bottom and a top (and I've seen no
evidence of this yet), the exploration of cultural evolution has no end.
Mathematics certainly has no end in sight. As we increasingly refine our
ability to ferret out useful new historical data out of what once seemed
nothing but noise, history keeps growing faster than the passage of time.
The practice of engineering creates complex new structures with rules of
their own that need to be understood on their own terms even if in theory
they can be reduced to physical laws the same way the human beings can be,
in theory.

Once you introduce life and technology into a universe, then the complexity
of that universe will necessarily grow faster than the capacity of the
living beings in that universe to comprehend it, because their very efforts
to comprehend the existing complexity will increase the complexity of that
universe even faster. This is my personal formulation of the Law of
Extropy. (Yes, that's tongue-in-cheek.)

Some people hate this idea. They want to have everything locked up solid in
their minds and safely stowed. I love this idea. For me, this idea means
that I'll never have to worry about getting bored, not even if I become a
Jupiter brain. For me, this idea is a source of deep joy.

(Don't let this idea lead to "rapture of the future"... just because the
complexity of the universe will grow faster than our ability to comprehend
it all, doesn't mean that the complexity of the universe will grow
inevitably. It just means that if the complexity of the universe shrinks,
our ability to comprehend it will recede before that tide. So if we want
the complexity of the universe to keep increasing, we have to keep working
at it. Think thermonuclear war for an example of our ability to create new
science/math/philosophy shrinking faster than the complexity of the stuff
we want to understand is shrinking.)

As for "measure", if any of you mathematicians out there have come up with
a surefire measure of complexity (as distinguished from randomness), well,
I'd be interested in hearing about it. And I guess what I'm really talking
about here is "stable complexity" or "homeostatic complexity", but here my
ideas get vague fast and all I have to say is that I really need to study
some more maths.

Subject: Wilson's Syndrome
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

I have had low body temperature for many years, however my thyroid panel
comes out normal, and using thyroid extract or T4 (Synthroid) made little
difference. Recently I became aware of another treatment which is based on
timed release T3. Many people have low basal temperature, normal thyroid
blood panel, and wonder why they feel lousy and the doctors tell them they
have no thyroid problems. 

If you suspect that your body temperature is low, do as follows. Get a glass
thermometer, or a digital one which is consistent (reads the same when used
three times in a row. Longs has one for about $7.00). Take your temperature
3 hours after waking, and twice more at 3 hour intervals. If the average of
these three readings is under 98.3 degrees, you might want to look into
Wilson's Syndrome. If any of you out there have low temperature, let me know
and I will post some more on this topic.

I have had Type II Diabetes for some time now, and a month ago my blood

meals and in the high 300s before breakfast. I have been using some
supplements by Mannatech and after a month of this, the numbers are in the
330 / 180 range now, with little changes in my diet or exercise (bad and

I like this analysis, and I think it's correct as far as it goes.

But you know, when most people ask for definitions, they want a genus and
differentiator. And the sad fact is that they usually want to be presented
with a genus that they already understand and a differentiator that they
already understand.

Some people like to see extropians as part of the genus "technophile" or
"futurist" or what-have-you, and use the libertarian stuff to differentiate
them. Other people like to see extropians as part of the genus "classical
liberal" or "libertarian" or what-have-you, and then try to come up with
differentia that separate out the conservatives, fundamentalist Christians,
etc.

Reformulating things the way Steve Witham has here is great fun and does
help us on the list think more clearly about these things, but "BUFF" is
not going to be a useful explanation of extropians to those who don't
already know for a while yet. We also need to come up with explanations
that don't need to be explained in turn, simple sequences of words that are
readily understandable to the vast majority of speakers of English who
aren't already immersed in this stuff.

But I still loved Steve's post.

Kurt Rongey:
In fact, the state itself has increased in size, economic impact and 
physical power throughout history due to "increasing returns."  

Increasing returns in the business world only seem to work for a while.
Eventually, a company's increasing returns turn it into an obese,
sluggish 
blob.  Increasing competitive forces and decreasing agility and
foresight 
eventually cause its downfall, or at least downsizing.  

There are, however, no forces to compete against the state, except for 
other states.

Kurt Rongey:
But apparently they didn't, since she went ahead and won the race,
despite
this limitation you would claim she had.  So, either:
	a) she was lying, and doesn't really believe God had anything to
		do with it.  or
	b) her competitors were also depending on "God's grace" and 
		didn't get it.  or
	c) her competitors were rational thinkers with high motivation,
		but just happened to be lousy runners.  or
	d) a mix of b & c.  or
	e) she somehow found a compatibility between her belief in God and
		the drive to do the work it takes to win an olympic medal.

Maybe the Believer has stronger motivation when doing it for God
(who is flawless and radiant and created the universe and all of that), 
than the one who is doing it for his or herself (who takes a crap 
every day, had acne as a kid, etc).

My point is that that certainty and determination have to come from 
somewhere, and must be intense to survive through the years of
training.  Pure love of the activity is probably the greatest reason
for having the drive to excel in it, no matter whether one wants to 
thank a mystical being for it or not.

BTW, I don't know what Donovan Bailey (Canadian 100m world record guy)
used 
for motivation, but hot damn, how about that look on his face after the 
race?!

I am looking for person(people) capable of describing a day in a life of an average 
human around Years 2050-2099. The description should include technology, food, 
entertainment etc. For those who believe "human", "day" and "life" are limited concepts: 
a series of typical events within a time unit of a dominating  intelligent entity on 
planet Earth. 

If such person(people) responds I will propose a way to greatly accelerate technological 
progress while getting rich (for those who care about today's money).

Go read your 12 Steps. "Higher Power As We Understand It". If I turn myself
over to the "higher Power", the mental resources devoted to the
Self/Identity/Ego process are released, possibly allowing better
performance. For example, a Higher Power might be defined as "My Totally
Focussed Functioning".

For an athlete interested in Olympic goals, I suspect they have little time
for the stuff we discuss on this list - so "God" is merely an acronym. (My
POV, not the athelete's)

Try Stewart Kaufman's book for lay persons, "At Home In The Universe". I
strongly suggest reading Levy's "Artificial Life" first, as the first few
chapters of Kaufman's book presume a basic knowledge of ALife and
Complexity/Chaos theory. There are some fascinating ideas re applications in
Biotechnology which may make most of the current biotech approches obsolete.

OK, here's a proposed definition:

Define Ma, the mass raised above the atmosphere by human activity. (shuttles,
satellites, probes, etc). The tendency to do so is the derivative, ie,

    d(Ma)/dt

I invite anyone with the required data and a strong interest in space to
look up the numbers and provide a yearly table, starting with Sputnik.

There are actually a series of derivatives here:

    d(Ma)/dt    - Mass into LEO and beyond
    d(Mtev)/dt  - Mass beyond Terran Escape Velocity (tev)
    d(Msev)/dt  - Ditto, Solar Escape Velocity
    d(Mgev)/dt  - Ditto, Galactic Escape Velocity
    d(Mlgev)/dt -
    d(Mu)/dt    -

The last two are left as exercises for the reader....

For SETI enthusiasts, there is d(b)/dt, where b is bits....

Hello again folks,

I didn't mean to distract the conversation onto libertarianism versus
collectivism -- I understand that y'all are mostly libertarian-oriented
and probably don't want to argue politics with someone who fundamentally
disagrees with you.

What worries me really is the link between transhumanism and
individualism -- a link which is reflected in Libertarian politics.

Transhumanism, to me, means going beyond humanity -- but it is not
necessarily an INDIVIDUAL quest, is it?  Can't we think in terms of the
whole human race transcending itself?

As I see it, none of us truly has an individual "self" -- the self
is a social/cultural construct.  We are all, in the end, made up
of EACH OTHER.  (This sounds flaky perhaps, but as I have shown in my
book "Chaotic Logic" it can be put on a mathematical basis).  
It is true that in becoming trans-human we may lose our "selves" as
currently conceived and thus lose this fundamental sociality.  But
it is also possible that sociality is inherent to intelligence.  IN
fact it is my inclination to believe this is true (as I argued in
a recent paper in Informatica called "Artificial Selfhood," also
contained at my website http://godel.psy.uwa.edu.au/)

If sociality is a necessary part of mind, then we need to be thinking
about transhumanism on a social rather than just individual level.
This is not really a criticism of Extropianism as it stands, more a
call for a different sort of emphasis.

At some point (soon) we are going to take charge of our own evolution.  
It will be directed toward some goal.  It is true that different people will 
have different purposes, at least for awhile.  I'm not sure this situation 
will be stable, however.  The Darwinian competition is going to turn 
rather vicious, and people with frivolous goals may not survive.

Ok.  Your point is well argued.  I may have to give up the word 
"complete."  As Freeman Dyson says, the universe is infinite in all 
directions.  I agree that this fact is a source of deep joy.  

However, I am speaking of a vision that I have already seen on several 
occasions;  at least I got a glimpse of it.  There are many questions in 
my mind about how to characterize it, but no question about whether it 
is real, or whether it is worth pursuing.

I often have that feeling and have to think the answer is, "we're already in
that world: AND "we'll never be in that world".  Living in the Bible Belt of
the U.S. I am *constantly* surrounded by an all-pervasive religiousity: Every
street corner seems to have some huge church edifice on it, fundamentalist
christian bumper stickers festoon every other car and people's speech is full
of references to god and religion.  I'm often struck by the *huge* gulf
between the ideas I share with a small circle of close friends and this net
community on the one hand and the overwhelming mass of people I encounter
every day on the other.  In many ways, even more disturbing is the apparent
religious conviction of most "educated" people I encounter: Despite lots of
"formal education", the ideas of the Enlightenment don't seem to have had
more than the most superficial impact on the world view of most people.  I
think to myself: "What if just one-quarter of what is spent on religion were
spent on furthering the transhumanist agenda?  Just think of the progress we
would make!"  It is frustrating and can be depressing.

The only way I can "reconcile" this is to be thankful that there is a cadre
of folks -- however small in relative terms -- who have internalized the
humanism of the Enlightenment and are pushing those ideas further.  It seems
that what will come is more of the same, i.e. that the "vanguard" will
continue to advance at an ever-accelerating pace, pulling at least some of
the rest of humanity behind it as matter of simple "social fluid dynamics" --
at least for a while longer.  If the rate of advance of the vanguard passes a
certain point (like the sound barrier?), their social sphere will completely
separate from the rest of humanity.  What happens after that could get very
weird, indeed ...

I agree with Lyle that this is going to happen eventually, not too
long after there becomes a variety of highly effective things a lot of
people can do to accelerate their own personal evolution.

However, it doesn't seem to be a commonly held view; lots of people
seem to believe that the technology will always create usable
resources faster than the accelerated personal evolution will entice
people to use them up, leaving each person with plenty of time for
leisure and frivolous pursuits.

This has immediate consequences.  If you think things will get
competitive eventually, you can start learning how to compete now.
Since we are a social animal, tying to be intelligently social is part
of this.  

If you think things will be loose and have lots of room for leisure
for the indefinite future, you might as well go have fun now.  Since
there is unlimited slack in your future, there's no need to preserve
relationships with anybody; there will always be more people, and even
if you gratituously offend everybody on hand, you'll still have
unlimited slack, maybe just a little less.

I think the stereotypical rude extropian has a wrong expectation about
how much slack is available in the long term.

I take issue with "primarily".  Data about current social structures
can tell us a great deal - you don't have to go back in time for data
to be useful.  Laboratory experiments also tell us a lot.  And theory
is very important for giving one concepts and hypotheses with which to
understand empirical data.  Without patterns to look for, history
doesn't say much.

Just because things will get competitive doesn't mean you can't have
fun indefinitely if you choose.   Just get rich enough before the
transition, and resist the urge to spend it all or copy yourself.

There's a lot more computational power in the human brain than just the
pieces that are good at handling formal systems and simulating von Neumann
devices. One doesn't have to be a Zen Buddhist to recognize this fact. (But

Certainly history in and of itself doesn't do much to supply us with
theoretical structures. Theory is a completely different issue. I'll take
good theory from whereever I happen to find it.

The thing that really sucks about history is that there's never a control
group. But history is still an incredibly rich source of data about
structures that are too large to study in a laboratory, and, because they
involve human beings who sometimes messily and unpredictably invent new
theories to guide their own actions, too complex to simulate. If laboratory
data and simulation data conflict with historical data, my own cautious
preferences lead me to side with the historical data. If a computer
simulation or a laboratory experiment were to lead to a conclusion that
Diocletian's policies would lead to a thriving and wealthy Roman empire, or
that Stalin's policies would lead to a thriving and wealthy Soviet Union,
I'd be *inclined* to discount the laboratory/simulation data on that basis
alone. Before I read Hayek I was a lot more cavalier about these things.

This may be a matter of taste, and my tastes in this matter are rather
ferociously pluralistic. Are you arguing for the homogenization of culture,
or against it? I oppose the homogenization of culture; in the *long* term I
think it would be a disaster. However, I also recognize that the only
long-term solution to this problem is offplanet diaspora. And in the
post-diaspora future I'm fairly confident that purposes/values will not
only be diverse, but will proliferate and ramify far beyond the scale of
value pluralism that we see around us in the world today.

In fact, that's the long-term goal toward which I work, because such a
cosmos of ramifying and proliferating cultures is precisely the sort of
cosmos in which I'd like to live in the long term.

The preservation of opportunities for the careful and painstaking pursuit
of all sorts of frivolous values is exactly what I like about peace and
liberty. First things come first, but the whole point of securing first
things is to allow time and security to work on secondary things... the
elegant and deliciously frivolous music of Maurice Ravel, for instance. Or
the exploration of Banach spaces. Or toy trains and flower arrangements.

I think I know of what you speak, but I don't know whether or not there's
much point trying to decide (a) whether or not you and I have had the same
vision and (b) whether the content of this vision is "really" monist or
"really" pluralist.

Here's my latest trick for this one. It vaguely and metaphorically
resembles a mathematical generalization over possible values.

Aristotle distinguished between extrinsic values and intrinsic values. He
thought intrinsic values were better because extrinsic values "partake of
drudgery". What bothered me about this is all the "higher values" like
truth and justice usually turn out to be generalizably extrinsic. Living
according to the "higher values" turns out to be useful in getting all
sorts of petty little personal preferences accomplished, and flouting the
"higher values" tends to screw you over.

And even though the quest for increasingly excellent scientific theories
turns out to be extremely generalizably extrinsic, those who contribute to
that quest hardly think of their activity as "drudgery". Usually it's
something that they come to value intrinsically as well, especially the
best of them.

Anyway (sorry about the laborious background): let's say there's something
you want, x, doesn't matter what it is. Now in general, for any possible
goal x, a better understanding of your environment will help you attain it.
Harmonious (and profitable!) interactions with your fellows will usually
help you attain it. (Minsky discusses this kind of thing in the "Functional
Autonomy" section of SOM.) There is a  small nonpermissible subset of
possible goals x for which this is not true (e. g. a desire to go around
randomly chopping off people's heads), and cooking up a demarcation of that
nonpermissible subset is a matter for further research. (This is the
problem of "natural law"... the marked-off subset of non-permissible goals
include things like murder and plunder.)

But there are many extrinsic subgoals that generalize very nicely across an
extremely broad set of permissible end-goals (the intrinsic ones). So if I
whimsically decide to constrain my goals to accord to natural law (I decide
I'm not interested in killing and plundering), then no matter what my
idiosyncratic goals are within the remaining goal-universe, I can serve
those ends indirectly by working towards increasing my understanding of the
world and increasing the harmony of my relationships with others (take
harmony in a strictly market sense, *if* you like, with profit as its
measure... there are other interpretations).

So, given the "natural law" constraints, I don't even have to know much
about  the particular identities of my idiosyncratic tastes and intrinsic
goals to know how I can serve them in the long run, to know what I ought to
do. (This is the theory, but see my remark at the end of this post.)

Why does the "natural law" mark off the non-permissible goals? Because
those goals are generalizably disextrinsic... they tend to work against the
attainment of any of the much larger set of possible goals not forbidden by
the "natural law". But the problem of making the demarcation precise is
still a hard one, though some good work has been done recently (e. g.
Gauthier).

The demarcation problem is also, for me, closely related to the foundations
of libertarian political theory. If there's going to be a government, it
should only prohibit a minimal set of "bad" things, and mandate practically
nothing. The demarcation of law (or what the law should ideally be) from
morality, and of morality from taste, is very important to me for this
reason. Law should be a lot less pluralistic than morality, and morality
should be a lot less pluralistic than taste. But all of these things are
values.

Making all this precise? Well, maybe I'll expand this into a thesis
someday, if I don't get sidetracked by some other interesting problem.

And before anyone leaps in, I already know that in theorizing about human
values, more than in any other theoretical domain, we must be very careful
not to confuse the map with the territory. These are just theories, or
rather analogies that point in a direction in which a theory might be
developed. I'll be happy if I can someday improve on Kant and Gauthier.
There will always be room for further refinements.

I am inclined to agree with you. Certainly 99.9% or so of the good ideas
and values in my head originated with someone else, and I'm inclined to
identify a large part of my "self" with these ideas and values that were
cooked up by someone else and transmitted into my culture and thence into
me. I judge these ideas and values, and sort them out myself, as an
individual, but I would never be able to cook them all up from scratch.
Without them, I'd be just another shuffling mammal.

But libertarian political theory is much too concrete to depend on these
abstract concerns about the boundaries of the self. Even a radical altruist
would have to admit that there's nothing compassionate about robbing Peter
to pay Paul. Libertarian political theory revolves around issues of the
plurality of values, the institution of property, and the ethics of the use
of force and fraud. Giving alms may be a moral mandate, contra Rand,
without necessarily making it morally permissible to *force* the giving of
alms.

I don't know of any altruist/collectivist arguments that solidly
demonstrate that it's okay for a person A to stick a gun to the head of
person B and make person B do something (or refrain from doing something)
that person B doesn't want to do (or refrain from doing). And ultimately,
these are the kinds of situations that libertarians are concerned with
identifying and preventing.

This is beautiful, and I agree with it strongly.

Hofstadter in GOEDEL, ESCHER, BACH, liked to talk about Jumping Out Of The
System so much that he made an acronym for it: jootsing. One of his ideas
there seemed to be that the crux of intelligence is identifying orderly
systems... and then jumping out of their limits. And one of the things he
seemed to be hinting at in that book is that this is a necessarily endless
process.

Hey, I hate being coerced as much as anyone.  I want to be allowed
to drop acid, to kill myself, to modify my brain with experimental
electronic circuitry.  

Freedom is an important value.  But there are other important values
too, such as compassion, and -- yes -- growth (progress? extropy?)....
In shaping a society we humans try to balance out these different values.
Increasing our share of one often seems to decrease our share of another.
That's what makes it difficult.  Libertarianism seems to result from
exalting freedom over all other values.  But even if one DOES exalt
freedom over all other values, it is not clear that eliminating government
would result in increased freedom anyway -- the state is obviously only
one kind of coercive power, and it serves, among other positive and
negative functions, to keep a hold on other coercive powers.

An interesting point, to me, is that when we move to a TRANS-HUMAN
society, the balance between these different values will be different.
I think the basic values will NOT change -- freedom, growth and compassion,
for example, are fairly universal things, not tied to our carbon bodies in
any essential way (I think).  But the parameters governing the balance
of parameters against each other will change.

So, for instance, freedom should be WAY easier to achieve in a cyber-society,
because the limitation of the 2-D surface of the earth will be removed.
It will be much easier for like-minded intelligences to "group" themselves
in such a way as to minimize interactions with other intelligences they
would rather not see.  (Now we have particular cities full of gays and
lesbians; particular countries full of Muslims, Jews, etc. -- but the
partitioning is very crude, not just because space is limited, but because
of the manifold particularities of human life on 2-D earth.)

On the other hand, oppression might be much easier to achieve in
cyber-society too.  Imagine a Hitler who had control over people's
REALITIES!!!  ... over the bit-patterns constituting their minds!!!

Everything we know about politics now -- libertarianism, Democrats,
Republicans, communists, socialists, etc. -- is implicitly conditioned
on human biology and 2-D earth life.  Each of these sociopolitical systems
represents a certain balance among important values, emphasizing some
and de-emphasizing others.  But the way the balances work out is going
to change when we leave our bodies behind!  \

And this change in the balance of SOCIAL values is going to change our
MINDS too.  This makes estimating the psychological effects of
"downloading" exceedingly difficult, doncha think?

Libertarianism, as something fairly well-defined and understood, is a
political ideology, not a system of morality. I'm one libertarian (among
many) who strongly values compassion.

But the debate is not really about some broad abstract generality such as
"eliminating government". The debate is really about legalizing pot, doing
away with preposterous subsidies, ending barriers to peaceful job-seeking
immigrants, minimizing tax rates, and other specific policy proposals. In
each specific policy proposal, there is little question that the policy
move recommended by libertarians would bring about a net reduction in the
operation of coercion in society. On those specific policy issues in which
the possible net reduction in coercion is uncertain or hazy, libertarians
do not take strong policy stands. That's part of what "libertarian" means.

This is not really new. The balance of the various parameters of value
already differs from person to person, and from culture to culture.

The whole idea behind libertarian political ideology is that different
people have different balances among the various values they hold, and in
many cases hold entirely different values, and that they should each be
allowed the freedom to use their own bodies and property in the pursuit of
those values. The whole idea behind the libertarian political ideology is
that the element of force not be used to impose a common morality on all,
that it should be used only to enforce the minimum morality needed for
people with widely diverse value systems to coexist peacefully.

So your trying to make out that libertarianism is somehow opposed to some
alternate value system misses the point. The only value systems that
libertarianism opposes are the ones which seek to impose themselves on
unwilling participants by force.

If you can point out a clear case of nongovernmental coercion in society,
the libertarian minarchists (at least) will heartily endorse the use of
government to minimize that coercion. But you've got to make a clear case
that the coercion is going on in the first place before you can invoke a
libertarian government to step in and stop it.

Thanks!  Makes sense, with a few fuzzy spots that probably stem from
my own ignorance.  I like the idea that the next step in a long term
plan to accomplish a goal doesn't change much when you change the
goal.  I'm not too clear on the distinction between extrinsic and
intrinsic goals, though.

I think I make a smaller whimsical decision than you do.  If I run
around chopping off people's heads, then eventually they'll get
together and stop me, probably by doing something functionally
equivalent to chopping off my head.  (We're talking unfriendly human
interaction here, not neurosuspension.  :-) Thus running around
chopping off people's heads isn't part of any long-term plan.  So
instead of whimsically deciding to constrain your goals to accord to
natural law, you can whimsically decide to have a long-term plan.
This (to me) feels like a smaller assumption, especially because I
don't know what you mean by "natural law".

Well, maybe.  If property rights hold up well enough, then yes, I
suppose that might work.  If the pleasure-seeker is too slow in
adopting advanced technology, then I suspect their property rights
would be violated somehow.

Eric says,

Ok, ok, ok.  I guess these issues have been beat into the ground by
other people in the past, already.  E.g., I would argue that I should
be allowed to drop acid if I want to.  But someone else might say:
No, that is an imposition on me, because the acid might make you go 
crazy and hurt me ... so your freedom to take acid acts against my
freedom to walk around unmolested....  And you have to take into account
all the different effects that each person's act has on everyone else.


I think about this stuff all the time, living in Australia and paying
the 42% national income tax here.  I miss the extra cash i would have
if the taxes were closer to the US level.  On the other hand, I also
like the low crime, national health care, and general absence of
squalor in city streets which results from having a really thorough
public sector (unlike the US social welfare system, which is half-assed
however you look at it; it's lousy socialism and lousy capitalism).
IN the US I had more "freedom" as to what to do with my dollars --
on the other hand, because of everyone having this extra "freedom,"
I lost other freedoms -- e.g. the freedom to walk ANYWHERE, anywhere I
want, without fearing for my life.  I can do this in Australia, and the
reason I can is that there are high taxes which support the poor, who
thus do not try to "earn" their livings by stealing my money....


There is an interesting psychology here too.  Humans will choose to 
pay a high tax rate, but would NEVER choose to donate a high percentage
of their income to anything besides themselves.  Well, almost never.
This is the same principle as the Christmas club or pension fund, 
I guess -- we make decisions IN ADVANCE which then constrain our
of-the-moment impulses later on.  So we vote for high taxes and then
grumble about them.  Funny organisms, we are, caught between
intelligent large-scale planning and momentary gratification.

Thing is, if we all download and live in some giant hard drive (or
whatever technology comes next), issues of resource allocation will
not go away.  We'll still have the same disputes of individualism
versus collectivism -- of narrow (Libertarian-style) interpretations
of freedom versus interpretations that take into account the whole
web of social interactions. 

That is why it would be very nice to have a compassionate, intelligent
scheme for allocating resources in place BEFORE we move into
cyberspace.  Unfortunately this seems unlikely to occur!  Instead
cyberspace will be colonized, most likely, by the capitalist "democracies"
we all know and love.  Welcome to Microsoft (TM) Reality!!!

Intrinsic goal: get some honey. Why? Because you just happen to want some
honey.

Extrinsic goal: raise bees. You don't really care about the bees, you just
want the honey. This is why Aristotle said that extrinsic goals partake of
drudgery. Of course, this is a specifically extrinsic goal (it doesn't help
you with anything other than getting honey), not a generalizably extrinsic
goal like seeking truth or dealing justly with your fellows.

Not having to change the next step in your long term plan when your long
term goal changes is especially helpful when you have no idea exactly what
it is you're going to be doing in two centuries.  ;)  A nice aspect of
generalizable extrinsicity is that it makes it possible to live rationally
without any specific long-term goals.

It sounds like you and I are talking about the same thing, except that I
wasn't able to wash off all the technical jargon implicit in the
complicated (but, I hope, precise) argument that I may be trying to make
someday.

"Natural law" is the sticking point you run into when people start saying
"good and bad are entirely subjective". Nobody worth discussing these
things with really believes, deep down inside, that the wrongness of murder
is entirely subjective. To me, natural law means the stuff that human
societies have universally found it wise to prohibit, through trial and
error over the course of history. This is a fuzzy set, of course. It's the
kind of thing you'd find on the law books of extreme minarchist
libertarians (like maybe Rothbard). It's a weird idea, but it's an
important one to me.

I'm beginning to suspect that values are on a tree-like spectrum, and at
one end you have mere matters of taste and mood, twigs branching and waving
and changing from person to person and time to time, and at the other end
you have the "trunk" of the "natural law": the prohibitions against murder
and plunder, the stuff that *everyone* really knows is wrong. The middle
branches in between these two extremes are what I think most people tend to
mean by "morality", especially when they're inveighing against it. But the
sort of morality that I'm interested in is the stuff at the trunk, which it
seems can neither be wished away nor adequately explained. Yet.

They're weird ideas, sure, but I don't really know how to get away from
them. So I keep thinking about them from time to time. It's a hobby.


>Sounds interesting.  Can you post a reference?

Um, Gauthier deals with justice only, I think. The review I wrote of his
book is up on the web at

        http://www.c2.org/~arkuat/meme/gauthier.html

He comes at this problem from two directions: the prisoner's dilemma and
the problem of externalities in economics, and he comes up with a newish
theory of rational behavior (contra Harsanyi and the classical game theory
crowd), a "constrained maximization" that seeks optimal outcomes instead of
equilibrium outcomes in those situations in which the optimum and the
equilibrium don't coincide. The easiest way to try to sum up his theory, I
think, is that it represents a solution to the prisoner's dilemma which is
midway between Axelrod's TIT-FOR-TAT (which can't be demonstrated rational
in one-shot interactions) and Hofstadter's "superrationality" from
Metamagical Themas, which ethical skeptics have a hard time with.

Most of us don't protect our property rights by adopting advanced
technology.  We don't keep up on the lastest kinds of weapons to
protect ourselves from predators.  We hire other people to do that.

If an entity had no goals at all, then then there would be nothing that it
ought to do. So we must have some basic drives or desires if we are to be
faced with oughts. I think that "oughts" come in because all of us, so long
as we choose to continue living, face the need to make choices and take
actions. If I want to live, then I ought to... eat, drink, seek shelter,
seek to earn a living, and pursue psychological health (else I will kill
myself sooner or later, either deliberately or through self-neglect), and so on.

Since the universe operates by certain laws, and because their are other
social facts that effect us, at least some values are rational rather than
subjective. I prefer "rational" to "objective" since values are only
objectively required *if* you want to continue living. The existence of
rational values does not mean that we must all have all the same values
since values exist on different levels and many of them are optional. Values
shade into tastes which are generally subjective. I think there are a range
of basic values, principles, and virtues that apply widely to human beings,
but this does not imply a universal total set of values.

This general outline fits what I take to be the core of Ayn Rand's argument,
though I dislike some of her formulations of it. I think it can be argued
(though I don't claim to do so here) that many extropian values are rational
values, at least in current and probably future conditions. It's arguable
that self-transformation in any radical sense was neither possible nor
desirable in early human history, but I'm certain that it's a rational value
to hold now. This illustrates why "rational" makes more sense than
"intrinsic" -- a value is rational because of how a person can function in
the real world; if the value were intrinsic you would have to value
something regardless of the nature of the world and your relationship to it.

The distinction is often made with a slightly different terminology:
Intrinsic vs. instrumental. An intrinsic goal is one valued for itself,
while an instrumental goal is one you value because it will help you get
something else that you want intrinsically. Of course, something could be
valued both intrinsically and instrumentally: I intrinsically value hiking
up a mountain, and I also value it instrumentally for the beneficial effects
on my muscular and cardiovascular systems.

Ayn Rand distinguished intrinsic, subjective and objective values. Intrinsic
values, in the sense she used it, were values that you had to hold even if
they were of no personal significance. If service to others is an intrinsic
value, you ought to do it even if you don't want to and even if it's bad for
you. Rand (correctly I think) denied the existence of intrinsic values in
this sense.

The subjective/objective distinction will be obvious, at least in outline.
I've come to prefer to talk of "rational values" rather than objective
values. Perhaps I can explain this when I reply to Tim's question about how
to get from "is" to "ought".

Given this way of defining the terminology, what I call "intrinsic" is
probably what Rand would've called "subjective", and I'm not in significant
disagreement with her about the nonexistence of what she referred to as
"intrinsic" values.

For me, intrinsic just means "not instrumental". Different people have
different intrinsic goals, and generally this is what they love doing.
Mathematicians love to do math, bicyclists love to cycle, artists love to
make art, gardeners love to garden, scientists love to do science, cooks
love to cook, programmers love to program, and philosophers love to
philosophize. When these things are done best, they are done "for
themselves", and not as instruments to some further end. So even though a
mathematician's value for mathematical beauty and an artist's value for
artistic creation are, in their "highest" form, not instrumental to any
further end, I don't want to seem to demean these kinds of values (which I
think are very important) by calling them "subjective". Yet it's also
widely recognized that it is somewhat demeaning to these activities and
purposes to insist that they serve as a means to some further "functional"
end (although they very often do, over and above their intrinsic worth).
Hence, I call them "intrinsic", but I accept them as diverse givens. It's
possible that they are subjective, but I don't want to call them that
because "subjective" has been heaped with bad and misleading connotations.

I've never cared too much for the subjective/objective distinction. (This
is why I use "intrinsic" in a different sense than Rand used: so I can
avoid the word "subjective".) For any particular philosophical problem, the
s/o distinction usually seems to melt away the closer you try to look at
the boundaries. But not only is it a confusing distinction, it's also one
that people get personally invested in, and that tends to degrade the
quality of discourse.

We seem to be talking about different things.  You are advocating 
pluralism.  I'm not advocating an ism, I'm just saying what I think will 
happen.  

But to be honest, the hard truth is that I really don't know what's 
going to happen.  I have an increasing sense of unreality about all this.   
I don't know why people with frivolous goals won't survive.

I disagree.  If you can't establish a private space on earth, you won't be 
able to do it offplanet, either.  Offplanet colonies, like island colonies, 
submarine crews, colonies of scientists in Antarctica, or mining towns 
in Alaska, will carry human culture with them.
